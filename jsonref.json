Had Nan Goldin not already used it in her haunting audio-visual installations, the song would make a great soundtrack to this timely group show.Its aim, according to curator Alona Pardo, is to explore how masculinity is “experienced, performed, coded and socially constructed” in photography and film from the 1960s to the present. It’s an ambitious undertaking, given the plurality of subversive masculinities that have have emerged since the 60s, and because of the resilience of certain forms of traditional ultra-male power, from the boardroom to the battlefield.In the first section, Disrupting the Archetype, the military looms large not only as a place of uber-masculinity, but also as a semiotic minefield of conflicting signals. What, for instance, are we to make of Thomas Dworzak’s cache of found studio photographs of young Taliban fighters, some holding hands amid ornate arrangements of flowers, their eyes rimmed with black kohl, their heads framed by brightly coloured, hand-painted haloes? The codes are so complex that, were it not for the occasional artfully placed AK-47, one would assume that these posed portraits were evidence of an ultra-clandestine gay culture in Afghanistan.On the opposite wall, Adi Nes’s staged colour portraits of soldiers in the Israeli Defense Forces are also elaborately staged, but in a very different way. Nes evokes an atmosphere of relaxed camaraderie, the men resting, dozing, laughing and, in one instance, pissing together in the open air of the desert. Making reference to scenes from art history, Nes’s soldiers are actually civilians acting out roles that “are all grounded in his own experiences as a gay Mizrahi Jewish man.” For me, this makes them not only unconvincing but disappointing – the artifice somehow undermining a masculinist subtext that would have been as evident, and more subversive, had he used a more straightforward documentary approach.In further contrast, photographs from Catherine Opie’s recent series High School Football appear to be staged, but are, in fact, complex portraits of image-savvy adolescent athletes who know exactly how they ought to look for the magazine spreads that may follow if they make it to the big league.Several versions of the subversive female gaze are present. Collier Schorr and Sam Contis tackle the enduring archetype of American masculinity that is the contemporary cowboy. Schorr’s teenage wranglers are both vulnerable and macho in some places their portraits are placed on top of images of older African American men to make a rather too overt historical point. Contis’s Deep Spring series, shot at an isolated all-male liberal college in the Sierra Nevada mountains, is evocative and questioning, the myth of the American west looming large in a narrative that moves deftly between the intimate and the elemental.Elsewhere, there are some powerful juxtapositions. A section mischievously titled Male Order pits a wall of Richard Avedon’s austere, black and white portraits of post-Watergate US political figures – including presidents Carter, Reagan and Bush Sr – against a large grid of Karen Knorr’s quietly subversive, quintessentially English series Gentlemen. Shot in the early 80s in private gentlemen’s clubs in London, Knorr’s evocation of establishment male entitlement is acutely observed in often languorous portraits, one of which echoes Jacob Rees-Mogg’s recent bout of contemptuous lounging. The accompanying quotes, all real, add layers of irony. “Men are interested in Power. Women are interested in Service” reads one above a portrait of a black man carrying a silver tea service.In the same room, there are two more darkly humorous takes on extreme masculinity: a wall of colour portraits of Hollywood Nazis – portrayed by Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood, Ronald Reagan, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy – by Piotr Uklański and a vitrine containing a Clare Strand’s tower of vintage Men Only magazines. It is not often you encounter the sublimely ridiculous and the ridiculously sublime in such close proximity.Jeremy Deller’s So Many Ways to Hurt You, a film portrait of the exotic Welsh-born wrestler Adrian Street, is a study in performative high camp of a particularly British variety, while an Andy Warhol film from 1979, Fashion: Male Models, comprises a series of deceptively straightforward interviews that cast light on the ways in which fashion conforms to, as well as challenges, traditional notions of masculinity. Neither quite prepares you for the brute primitivism of Richard Mosse’s film Fraternity, which consists of young white men from Yale engaged in a guttural shouting contest for a keg of beer. Here, he who shouts the loudest also manages to shout the longest (which may yet prove to be a fitting metaphor for the Trump years).Throughout, the exhibition moves between the conceptual and what might be called the intimate self-documentary. The most riveting examples of the latter occur in a section called Too Close to Home: Family and Fatherhood. Images by the late Masahisa Fukase are unmissable. Alongside playful but revealing portraits of his extended family are small, intimate, monochrome portraits of his ageing father that are almost overwhelming in their subtle intensity. In one, his dead father’s face is outlined beneath a white sheet in another, we see his father’s bones after cremation. Fukase’s unflinching gaze reminds us that the ties that bind are tightest at the very moment when they are pulled asunder.Equally affecting in an altogether more conflicted way is Anna Fox’s My Mother’s Cupboards and My Father’s Words, in which she juxtaposes “colour photographs of my mother’s tidy cupboards with excerpts of my father’s rantings”. The tension here is between the formal beauty of these miniature pictures – shelves filled with pink china crockery and rose-tinted glasses – with the often grotesque violence of the intricately inscribed words – “I’m going to tear your mother to shreds with an oyster knife”. I’m still haunted by the unsettling nature of this work.In dramatic contrast is Richard Billingham’s series Ray’s a Laugh, full of extreme family drama undercut with moments of tenderness between Billingham’s alcoholic father and feisty mother. No matter how many times I have seen these images, their power remains undiminished. This is family life in extremis a dogged masculinity, born of necessity, fuelling even his mother’s behaviour.Masculinities provides much to think about, from Ana Mendieta’s subversive self-portraits as a man to Hank Willis Thompson’s series, Unbranded, which uses American magazine adverts stripped of their text and context to illustrate the ways in which the African American experience has been commodified by corporate white America. Throughout, there are tropes and parallels – some intentional, some not – that reverberate across cultures and time. Thus, Karlheinz Weinberger’s portraits of Swiss rebel youth in the 60s – all camp poses and customised DIY styles – have certain echoes with Hal Fischer’s more conceptually mischievous 1977 series Gay Semiotics, a staged documentation of the sartorial iconography of gay communities in San Francisco.It is great to be reminded of how incisive Laurie Anderson’s series Fully Automated Nikon is in the way it skews the casual sexism women encountered daily in 1970s New York, and how prescient was Marianne Wex’s Let’s Take Back Our Space, which nailed manspreading long before the term was invented. If you have time to linger, be sure to watch Isaac Julien’s Looking for Langston, an intoxicating meditation on gay desire, black identity and literary reputation that also works here as an interregnum between the rich overload of imagery elsewhere.Masculinities roams far and wide to prove its point: that what makes a man a man is more complex and evolving than even the far-seeing Aznavour imagined in that groundbreaking 1972 song. My one reservation is that nothing here reflects the unsettling rise of a strain of “alt-right”, proudly toxic masculinity that has emerged of late alongside, and fuelled by, populist politics. It lurks in Mosse’s and Andrew Moisey’s contrasting depictions of fraternity rituals, but in its rawest, most belligerent form is absent. This seems an oversight. Other than that, Masculinities will make you think again about the meanings of maleness in a world increasingly defined by ever more extreme definitions of the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a6a520ea3b63d1f5d90adec60810cc6968031e5/0_360_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba0e94d72a5609d05e146c1a9a6eda40","title":"the ten commandments as told by presidential figures in pictures","story":"In her new photo series, artist Dina Goldstein has created tableaux that match a different president to one of the Ten Commandments.

(His last book broke with the formula to follow a harassed screenwriter on holiday with his family it’s called You Should Have Left.) The creative travails of men, and the collateral damage they inflict, may not seem a surefire draw for book-buyers, yet Kehlmann, who writes in German, is translated into more than 40 languages – he’s fun to read, and his books travel light, uncluttered by cultural references.Not so Tyll. Set in early 17th-century Europe, it takes place during the thirty years’ war, a sectarian power struggle over the Holy Roman Empire, which ravaged Germany and left millions dead. Wikipedia wormholes await the reader unfamiliar with, say, the battle of Zusmarshausen, the poet Martin Opitz, or indeed the novel’s eponymous hero, lifted from a 16th-century folk tale about a lawless practical joker who roams the land exposing hypocrisy (Michael Rosen once adapted the story).Kehlmann establishes Tyll as a flesh-and-blood figure by giving him tragic origins. We’re shown his tough village boyhood as the son of an intellectually curious miller whose interest in infinity – “the fact that to every number you can add another, as if there were no God to stem such a tide” – spells doom when witch-hunting Jesuits turn up from England in the wake of the gunpowder plot.Kehlmann puts us deftly inside Tyll’s fretful mind. “When God wants to make a person, why does he do it in another person?” he wonders, eyeing his pregnant mother, Agneta. When she goes into labour as they are taking flour to the next village, the boy is ordered to wait alone while she turns back. Terrified, deep in a forest with their donkey, he worries she’ll find out that he’s wet himself.Although he’s brought to life with plausibly universal detail, the point isn’t that Tyll could be any boy. Far from it: when he’s eventually discovered in the forest, he’s coated in flour, wearing the donkey’s scalp it’s a grotesque portent of his future as an agent of chaos who, refusing the cards he’s dealt, tosses them in the air.Yet just as we settle down for a character-centred picaresque, the novel shifts into an episodic hopscotch through the royal politicking behind the continent-wide bloodshed. When Tyll leaves his village with a vagabond balladeer to become a travelling player, he’s relegated to the novel’s margins, as the focus falls on a series of real-life historical figures, including Elizabeth Stuart, granddaughter of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her ill-fated husband, Frederick, King of Bohemia.Like recent Black Death novels by James Meek and Oisín Fagan, Kehlmann’s portrait of bygone dark times both indulges and disrupts the apocalyptic turn in present-day commentary on current affairs. You could see Tyll as an attempt to politicise his usual man-of-genius trope, even if the anti-authoritarian spirit he embodies is hardly democratic – at one point, a villager recalls the mayhem his visit unleashed: “We understood what life could be like for someone who really did whatever he wanted … we understood that we would never be such people”.Constructed as a string of disconnected, slyly contradictory vignettes, the fable-like narrative darts airily around with vivid detail and neat comic timing, treating the cast, and our attention, as playthings. It’s intricate and cleverly done, but not entirely satisfying: nothing in the book matches the spellbinding opening third, and ultimately it has the air of a slightly self-denying experiment – as if Kehlmann sought to test his skill by doing without the novel’s single most interesting character.• Tyll by Daniel Kehlmann (trans by Ross Benjamin) is published by riverrun (£18.99).

Three candidates enter the final furlong, still travelling the country in a last parade of hustings. The 4 April finishing post still seems far away as they strive for something new to say, each tiptoeing around the perimeters of a deeply split electorate. Their campaigns now have membership lists: everyone is bombarded.Inside Keir Starmer’s phonebank his volunteers were speed-dialling: unlike the recipients of the hell of cold calling, this pool of fully engaged citizens, the rare numbers who belong to a political party, are keen to talk. I spoke with members from Midlothian to Walsall, Bolton to Bedfordshire, Norfolk to Deal, all with tales of the politics of their towns, their general election catastrophes – and the great ide between them.Voices from a riven party included Jim from Birmingham. His local party nominated Starmer, but on a tiny turnout. “Not me, absolutely not Keir. He’s a Trojan horse, a suited-and-booted knight of the realm, a triangulator on the side of MPs who tried to vote out Jeremy Corbyn.” Which of his policies does he oppose? “He won’t introduce open selection of MPs. I’m disgusted by most Labour MPs’ behaviour in the last years.” Trigger ballots to reselect Labour MPs poisoned local parties, wastefully burning energy and emotion before being suspended in the run-up to the general election, so is that really what matters most after four election defeats? Yes, it seems so for members such as him: “Keir’s in with the MPs who say they’ll quit if Rebecca Long-Bailey wins.”Here’s Dora from Oxford backing Long-Bailey: “If Keir wins, it’s going back to the Blairites, PFI hospitals, the Iraq war. We’d be going back on everything we’ve gained in the last five years. We’ve got the party right for the first time.” Chris from Bedfordshire agrees: “Keir’s too centrist. We’ve fought this long for an intellectually socialist party. But – well, I don’t know – maybe to win we have to go with Keir all the same.”Most were strongly for Starmer, though a few gloomily sought to dodge the critical choice by opting for Lisa Nandy, who has indeed had a good campaign. This was no straw poll, but a random flavour of what all members know: this visceral tug-of-war will set Labour’s destiny, even the survival of the party as a serious contender for power. On one side are those who believe the capture of Labour for a purer socialism is all that matters in the long run, looking to far horizons several elections ahead. (But as Keynes said, in the long run we’re all dead.) Others see this contest as an emblematic last chance.Dan, once a south London councillor, was the spirit-raising call of the day – echoing many others: “I’m more hopeful about Labour than I’ve been in years! All the family, four generations, distant cousins, all joined to vote Keir. The election felt like the shock of 1992, the despair. But Labour recovered by 1997. I see a lot of hardcore Momentums, but those young idealistic ones are coming round to Keir, they want to win. My dad and sister voted Corbyn, but they’re voting Keir.”The rift is so deep that some misguidedly yearn for a Starmer victory to purge Momentum from the party: that’s not the way, Starmer warns. The civil war has to end – his programme is a plan to unite not ide.At the next desk was a man who quit the Liberal Democrats the day after December’s election, joining Labour to volunteer for Starmer. Nearby, the Labour peer Helena Kennedy paused from calling members to tell of her years in chambers when Starmer arrived as a pupil barrister: “He was the smartest by far, and we need clever. He has such good judgment, he’s courageous and decent through and through. He did so much pro bono work – for the miners, for Doreen Lawrence, for people beaten up in police stations and for disabled children’s benefits – that the head of chambers warned him he needed to do more paid work or he’d never get a mortgage.”Her chambers urged him to apply to be director of public prosecutions: “We needed someone there with his values.” She talks of his template for dealing with domestic violence, training a cadre of prosecutors for sexual offences. Expect all of his past to be probed and attacked. Those trawling through his every decision as DPP often make wild accusations, misdating events before or after his time. The latest charge is over his unsurprising belief that benefit fraud, like tax evasion, should be prosecuted. But just wait for the Tory press to let fly if he wins: a Labour leader needs titanium armour-plating and he is more tested than most.Most members I called spoke of his authority and gravitas, but whatever bookies think, a Starmer victory is not in the bag with an unpredictable electorate. Some said he’s short on jokes, but others that he’d be good at skewering Boris Johnson’s duff jocularity. Many looked forward to Starmer at the dispatch box with Labour’s great underused talent lined up behind him. This anarchic government has already lost a chancellor, has backbenchers threatening trouble and even its press backers are growling at No 10’s dictatorship. It’s ripe for challenge. None better than the grand prosecutor himself for a forensic demolition of JohnsonDominic Cummings misrule. The stronger the vote for Starmer, the more Labour proves it is out of recovery and back on the frontline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6428ca599347bfee7e7cfbdc841a5237e7df1d5a/0_343_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be7e4d646ec748e01e9453573973acdd","title":"meghan banished kate has to represent all modern womanhood duchess of cambridge tabloids","story":"The Duchess of Cambridge has raised her voice in support of small children and early years development – what’s not to love?

Their school, the International Academy of Greenwich (IAG), is earmarked for closure and the worry of watching it happen – friends taking up places elsewhere, teachers leaving – is affecting both children badly, their mother says.“My daughter is so upset by it all: she is losing her friends and she is worried about going to a new school, with her GCSEs about to start. She is despondent about the whole process,” says Grace.“My son seemed to be holding it in,” she adds. “But before Christmas, he said: ‘We were told by the school that it wouldn’t close, and you told me there would be a school for me. You let me down,’ and then he just shut himself in his room.”Now Grace, a single parent, has given up her job, concerned she would otherwise be unable to support her worried children, and fearful about the logistics of trying to find them new school places.Since November, when the IAG became the latest free school to announce its closure, parents of more than 200 pupils have been scrambling for places at other secondaries.One mother says her son sobbed after being told he had to leave, while for another family, the closure has been a key factor in their decision to move from the UK.Many parents now say free schools should never have been allowed to open without planning permission for permanent buildings. The IAG families believe they are at the sharp end of the free school policy, which has been the government’s main vehicle for opening new schools in England since 2011. There have been success stories, such as the Michaela free school in north London, but the failures – of which there have been plenty – are traumatic for those affected.Overall, 27 free schools have had to close or change management. Sometimes children have been left with little or no education for weeks following a school closure while their parents search for a place elsewhere.Since 2016, some 92 schools have opened in temporary accommodation and of these, just 27 have moved into a permanent home. Last year alone, 25 schools opened on a temporary site.Some of the locations have been eyebrow-raising. One free school opened next to an airport runway another in a building about which officials had expressed multiple safety concerns.Abacus Belsize school, in London, has spent six years in temporary premises while a planning dispute rages over its proposed move into a former police station, bought for £14m and approved by Boris Johnson as mayor of London.A primary free school in Croydon was recently graded “inadequate” by Ofsted, with children being taught in portable buildings since 2014. And Southwark free school, again backed by Johnson, closed in 2017 after five years as it, too, had never managed to find a permanent home.The IAG’s story is the latest example of how the free schools policy can be undermined by poor planning. It was allowed to open in September 2016 in an office building owned by a church while waiting for its new building on playing fields – a location, on protected metropolitan open land prone to flooding, that was highly controversial.Meanwhile, the DfE ploughed money into the school’s temporary premises, paying the church £395,000 in rent each year – £1,500 per pupil. Parents, many of whom were attracted to IAG because it offered the international baccalaureate curriculum, were told not to worry. Yet emails released under freedom of information show that by last April, Greenwich planning officials were telling the DfE that they did not think there was a case to open the school. While in 2018 Greenwich had stated that there was a shortage of school places, now it was now saying there was not.Sure enough, in July last year council planners refused permission for the playing fields site, provoking uproar among the IAG’s parents and pupils. With ministers saying the school could not continue long term in its temporary premises, its closure was announced.The IAG, which as of last term had 267 year 7-10 pupils, will close for years 7-9 this summer, with year 10 pupils, who have started their GCSEs, finishing them at the school next year. Pupils have been given no guarantees of places elsewhere, and some parents have moved their children into private education. Kate Simpson is emigrating with her family to Toronto, where she grew up, although she had hoped to stay in London until her son, Cameron, 11, had completed high school. “We are devastated that the school is closing. Our decision to leave it is no reflection on its incredible teachers. It’s the system that’s the problem.”Another parent, Michaela Barnes (not her real name), has managed to find her son a place elsewhere, but only after he had started at the IAG and she had bought his uniform. On the evening of his first and last day at IAG he was “curled up on the floor, in the foetal position, sobbing”, she says.Peter Godden, who has moved his son, aged 14, to a private school, says: “The government let these schools open in temporary buildings, then let them fall by the wayside when planning permission was not given. It’s scandalous.”Comments from the DfE and Greenwich council indicate they were at loggerheads. Greenwich says: “This regrettable situation has arisen due to the Department for Education granting permission for a school with no permanent accommodation to open ... the Royal Borough of Greenwich is working closely with Lewisham council to ensure that the pupils, families and staff affected … receive co-ordinated and comprehensive support.”This will ring hollow for the IAG families. Grace, who has found her children a place at an under-subscribed secondary for September, says: “This has destroyed my faith in the education system. Those in charge genuinely don’t seem to care about the impact on children of schools closing: it is just a political game to them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5df5c67b60187b1dc4182eadbc5d29c249a87dd/0_238_7134_4280/master/7134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd412f41a9e381fef722c3bd9dd790f","title":"renewables barely feature building programme schools solar panels","story":"Solar panels, heat pumps and sustainable designs bypassed – but now one Somerset school is taking a standIt is a modernist version of a log cabin nestling in a busy south London suburb – and it is about to make history. The new building for Hackbridge primary, in Sutton, opens next week as England’s first zero-carbon school, able to produce and conserve as much energy as it uses, and even put unused electricity generated back into the grid.With its wood frame and cladding, solar panels, pumps to collect heat from the ground, and insulation made from recycled newspaper, it is the first school in England to meet the ambitious Passivhaus Plus low-energy design standard.“The school will have no net demand on an annual basis, for electricity and no gas connection,” Architype, the architects, say.Sadly, however, only a handful of the 500-plus schools being rebuilt or refurbished across the county through the government’s £4.3bn priority school building programme are installing renewable energy technology – and the Department for Education’s (DfE’s) recommended designs do not include renewables. Hackbridge’s new building was subsidised by Sutton council as part of its broader environmental strategy.High Weald academy, in Cranbrook, Kent, is one school whose new buildings, officially opened last month, do not have the technology to harness green energy. And in Birmingham, work is being completed on new buildings for Colmers school and sixth form college to offer “modern facilities” with an emphasis on “quality and innovation throughout the building programme”. Again, there are no solar panels or heat pumps, two of the most cost-effective ways of harnessing green energy.In Watford, Hertfordshire, Westfield academy’s light and airy building, opened three years ago, was hailed by its headteacher, Tim Body, as “a remarkable new building for the 21st century”. It has a fully equipped design and technology rooms, ICT suites, a professional theatre, dance studio and a modern beauty salon. It, too, is not equipped to harness green energy.In fact, of the 260 schools rebuilt or replaced across England between 2015-19 in the first phase of the programme, very few use renewable energy – nor do most of the further 277 schools being refurbished in the second building phase to 2021.But one secondary, in Somerset, is taking a stand, rejecting the plans for its rebuild, unveiled last month, on the grounds that the design does not meet the aspirations of parents, pupils and staff to protect the planet. They say new premises for Kingsmead, the 880-pupil secondary school in Wiveliscombe, Taunton, provide an opportunity to make carbon savings and reduce energy bills.Liz Pow, the school’s director of finance and operations, says: “Unfortunately, as the project is managed by the Department for Education, we don’t have any input into the energy efficiency of the build. The topic of renewable energy was raised several times during the consultation process as students, staff, parents and the wider community feel it should be an important feature of any new school.”Mark Blaker, an independent district councillor, has written to Rebecca Pow, the local Conservative MP and a junior environment minister, asking her to intervene. “This will be the biggest building for a 10-mile radius. It will be a statement of our community aspirations and our hopes for generations of young people to come. Ignoring the economic and environmental benefits of renewable energy in the much-needed new building feels like a betrayal of those aspirations,” he says.Colin Diamond, professor of education at Birmingham University and a former Kingsmead parent and governor, says: “It’s astonishing to learn that the DfE is not leading by example here. It continues to procure new school buildings with no apparent awareness of sustainability and regenerative economics. This is a golden opportunity to create a carbon-neutral learning environment where students can find out about energy efficiency first hand in their own community school.”Caroline Buckingham, a member of the ethics and sustainable group of the Royal Institute of British Architects, explains that contractors and designers on the DfE’s priority programme work to generic briefs. “The frameworks go out to contractors who have usually built lots of schools and have got meeting the DfE’s standards down to a fine art. There are no bells and whistles, no wriggle room for innovation because these buildings were approved during times of austerity, based on pound per square metre,” she says.“Sometimes you get a really good local authority that is pushing sustainable building and includes renewable technologies, but it is usually for smaller primary or special schools.” James Eades, operations director of the energy consultancy firm Energymyway, says school roofs are usually perfect for solar panels – but the people paying for the build may not be interested in reducing ongoing running costs.Changes in government policy, such as the reduction in 2016 in the price paid for solar energy exported to the grid, have hit the industry hard in England – since then, the number of registered installers has gone down from 5,000 to 1,600, he says.“However, since the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations we have been getting more inquiries for solar panels from people who want it for environmental reasons, not purely on investment grounds,” he says. “Often when schools fit panels to existing buildings, it is the parent teacher associations that fund them.” As school buildings are occupied during daylight hours, electricity can be used as it is generated. On present prices, the costs of panel installation, between £38,000 and £50,000, would be recouped within five to seven years respectively, he says.The DfE, however, says its priority build programme does address environmental performance. “Reduction in energy use in new buildings is a key priority and DfE-delivered schools are designed to be straightforward buildings, easy to use with simple built forms which adopt a ‘fabric first’ approach limiting the amount of energy required in their operation,” said a spokeswoman. The DfE is working with Innovate UK, the quasi-government innovation agency, to develop a model of sustainable future schools, she adds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f69d6df5393019d437c692181ac8b3414f8ca83/0_36_960_576/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed70165f9679e3d916ecb12e9b54afef","title":"what four years at sea taught me about our relationship to the ocean","story":"Oceans are central to the story of civilisation – so why do so many of us feel disconnected from them?It was on day 11, I think, that I stopped getting out of bed at all. I had already let my hygiene standards slip to the point that a large knot was starting to form in my hair. Later my mother would have to cut it out with scissors. She didn’t mind. We were all in the same boat.I was nine years old, and nearly two weeks into sailing across the Atlantic with my family. My father had sailed all his life, and introduced my mother to it and they spent years preparing to sail around the world. Including my little sister, that made four of us aboard a 52ft yacht – our home for four years from 2000, in which time we got from Dorset to New Zealand.The longest period we spent entirely at sea was 21 days, and we did so twice: from La Gomera in the Canary Islands to Barbados, and then from the Galápagos Islands to Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia. The first trip I remember spending mostly in bed, below deck in the dark, listening to Wings on cassette, forging a new relationship to time.I grew used to observing the ebb and flow of my thoughts with a languor that today would probably be praised as meditative. The days slid by, mostly unbroken except for meals – you came to really anticipate meals – and milestones: quarter-way, halfway, crossing the equator, which we marked with little parties.Not long after the sun had gone down, you’d go to sleep – partly because artificial light drained the boat’s battery, and partly because the sooner you went to sleep, the sooner another day would pass, and the sooner you would arrive. (I was lucky – being nine, I was spared night watch. My parents slept in alternating shifts of two hours for the whole journey.)When we finally reached Bridgetown in Barbados, and set foot on land for the first time in three weeks, my knees wobbled, bracing for the next wave that didn’t come.That transatlantic crossing is a well-trodden path, from 15th-century navigators from Italy and Spain to Greta Thunberg’s voyage to New York last year. All of history, in fact, can be charted from the world’s oceans, as David Abulafia attempts in The Boundless Sea: A Human History of the Oceans, a 1,000-page doorstopper that he nonetheless makes no pretence is either “complete or comprehensive”.Connections made by sea “have brought together peoples, religions and civilisations” through conquest and colonisation, migration and trade, writes Abulafia, an emeritus professor of Mediterranean history at Cambridge – and in the process changed the world. Much of it has been driven simply by curiosity, and the desire to accumulate knowledge, he says.“Even if you go back to the time before Christopher Columbus, when the open Atlantic was very little known, the myths and assumptions that developed about it – the ‘sea of darkness’ and then, on the other hand, ‘the isles of the blessed’ – the fascination with what lies beyond the horizon was certainly an important part.”I see elements of that in my father, whose 50-year passion for sailing goes well beyond what you might call a hobby. “He’s only happy at sea,” says Mum, who is happy at sea, but also in her garden, or at a concert hall, or with her children.My parents remain “liveaboards”, sailing international waters from New Zealand. For them, it is a lifestyle that they have opted into, a way to see the world from a relatively unique vantage point.Yet for most of history there has also been “a mercenary dimension” to ocean exploration, says Abulafia, “the wish to exploit”: “You know you’re taking risks, but these are risks that can bring you the most fantastic returns.” Maritime trade has been more productive and enduring than the Silk Road in the 16th century, shipping spices from India proved so lucrative for Portugal that the Portuguese king made disclosing the route punishable by death.At many levels, the story of civilisation is a story of the seas – but it is easy to overlook that from land. Most people, even those who live by the coast, have no more personal connection to the sea than the limited or conditional view afforded by a passion for water sports, say, or the odd trip to the seaside. A more intimate relationship can be incompatible with conventional ways of life and maybe – the knot in my hair might attest – its quality.At the same time it changes you, in what can feel like a very profound way. It was only relatively recently, I’m embarrassed to say, that I realised that my experience was not universally shared – that not everyone had known the open ocean, with no land in sight in any direction for many miles. No other boats, either – just endless sea, sometimes even indistinguishable from sky an expanse of grey or blue, entirely uninterrupted, except by you.It is hard to convey what that feels like, the effect that it can have. You feel dwarfed and insignificant, of course – but the mind cannot hold on to reverence for long. I remember it more often playing tricks on me, registering patterns and shapes in the movements of the wave – my brain determinedly generating interest, overlaying meaning, as though it could not make sense of there being only water everywhere.Even as a child, though, there was something about being at sea that made me feel well: more vital, clear-headed. In fact the benefits of “blue space”, for body and mind, have been established by decades of research, from environmental factors such as more vitamin D and less polluted air and the increased activity that tends to go with being in nature.More significant is the psychologically restorative effect, where the movement of water – its literal immersiveness – can force attention outwards, beyond the self. But these effects on mood tend to be most acute at coastal margins, where the sea meets the land. “The optimal environment has both,” says Dr Mathew White, an environmental psychologist with BlueHealth. “If you’ve ever been on a cruise, or crossed to France, it’s pretty boring out there when you can’t see the coast.”As a crew member on the inaugural voyage from New York to Macau in 1784 grumbled of their smooth passage: “It has been one dreary waste of sky \u0026amp water, without a pleasing sight to cheer us.” Abulafia paraphrased: “One went to sea for excitement, and all that happened was that the captain fell against a railing and bruised his head and arm.” He suspects that some ships’ diarists exaggerated the risk of storms and shipwreck so as to enliven accounts “of a flat sea and neutral sky for days and days”.Yet, in imagining a life at sea, most people seem less inclined to think of tedium than terror. Many have told me that the thought of being stranded in the open ocean is one of their greatest fears I’m not sure that they would single out being lost in a forest, for example, or on a snowy mountain in the same way, though all three landscapes are alien and potentially dangerous.In fact the first question I am most often asked about my childhood is “Were there any storms?” or, more to the point: “Were you scared?” The answers are yes, only one, a freak occurrence overnight and no – I slept through it. My parents were highly risk-averse, setting out for sea only when the weather forecast was favourable and they had supplies – food, medical, electrical – to account for every possible eventuality.The exhaustive (and expensive) logistics tend to be glossed over in the other image people have of being at sea – the romantic one, of chucking it all in and sailing off into the sunset. Whether or not this idea appeals to you was found by data scientists at the dating app OkCupid to be one of the strongest predictors of romantic compatibility I know enough to answer no.Both scenarios, the worst-case and the rose-tinted, are telling of the disconnect most people feel from the ocean. A sense of trepidation has figured in seafaring through history, except among those whose knowledge and mastery of the ocean was evolved over several millennia to seem almost innate – the early Polynesian navigators of the Pacific, the ancestors of the New Zealand Māori and Hawaiians.Even if my parents have wanderlust in their DNA, I’m not sure it was handed down to me. Though I spent the first half of my life sailing, I acquired none of the skills – I couldn’t even manage a bowline knot. I have blamed it on my being a child, but the truth is I have never had any interest in boats beyond as a means of accessing the open ocean.I still feel a strong connection to the sea – but it has been challenging to maintain in my adult life, from the tower block in south London where I now live. When I am struggling to get to sleep I play ocean sounds through my phone, a crude attempt to simulate the limitlessness, even transcendence, I remember feeling out in open water.The ocean presents a potential passage through history, like handling an ancient piece of pottery only more so, because it “is alive, like a person”, to paraphrase an Indigenous Australian saying. You can be claimed by the sea without drowning. I feel its absence on a bodily level like a mineral deficiency, and make regular visits to the coast to “top up”, as the geographer Catherine Kelly evocatively put it. Now, although long-distance passenger travel by sea has become almost unheard of, Thunberg’s voyage across the Atlantic, and the growing “no-fly” movement to cut down on carbon emissions, could suggest turning tides.The oceans face considerable challenges themselves, from plastic pollution and deep-sea oil drilling, to unsustainable shipping and fishing. The rising acidity of the Pacific Ocean is causing crabs’ shells to dissolve. Warming temperatures have already opened up new trade routes over the top of Russia and Canada. We face the beginning of a new chapter in the history of oceans – for us along with them.Abulafia notes that rising sea levels have been suggested as a precipitating factor in past migration, forcing people to go in search of new land. A study last year predicted that warming temperatures will raise sea levels by 30cm by the end of the century, on top of the contribution from melting ice and glaciers.These are uncharted waters that humanity is navigating – but not, there is some comfort in acknowledging, for the first time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec2e9d3428d67732b86f061bf4d4112027d9757a/0_25_2334_1400/master/2334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0275f083c49411c02e7c26d8cd3377ca","title":"world leaders urged to step back from precipice of ecological ruin aoe","story":"As governments prepare to negotiate a Paris-style UN agreement on nature, 23 former foreign ministers have issued a call for urgent actionHumanity’s ongoing destruction of nature threatens the survival of our species, a group of former foreign ministers has warned, calling on leaders to step back from “the precipice” of irreversible ecological ruin and protect the planet.The planet’s rapidly warming oceans must be the focus of increased conservation efforts due to their importance in producing oxygen and food for billions of people, the former ministers added, as governments prepare to begin negotiations for a Paris-style UN agreement on nature next week.In a statement signed by 23 diplomats – including former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind – world leaders are urged to back the draft UN agreement to protect almost a third of the world’s oceans and land.Next week’s meeting in Rome – originally scheduled to take place in Kunming, China but moved to the Italian capital in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak – will be the first time governments formally react to the 20-point proposals to halt and reverse bioersity loss.“The loss and degradation of nature jeopardises human health, livelihoods, safety and prosperity. It disproportionately harms our poorest communities while undermining our ability to meet a broad range of targets set by the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. We must rise above politics and ideology to unite the global community around the urgent cause of protecting our planet and way of life,” reads the statement, which was released through non-profit thinktank Aspen Institute.The former ministers highlighted the climate crisis, the “excessive exploitation” of natural resources, and ecosystem degradation as grave threats to international security, warning they “imperil the future for our grandchildren”.“Humanity sits on the precipice of irreversible loss of bioersity and a climate crisis that imperils the future for our grandchildren and generations to come. The world must act boldly, and it must act now,” the statement continues.The comments follow those by indigenous groups, scientists and business leaders ahead of the meeting in Rome.Last month, the UN’s new bioersity chief warned humanity will have “given up” on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems.When asked what not taking action would mean, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, told the : “The risks will be major. One is that we will not have listened to the science and the evidence provided. Because we will not have listened, it means the global community will have said: let bioersity loss continue, let people continue to die, let the degradation continue, deforestation continue, pollution continue, and we’ll have given up as an international community to save the planet.“I hope that’s not where any of us would want to be.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4390e4d870d4dbe97ee9468e0a6af7e52532a3c6/0_1362_4032_2418/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d87827ec6f5ba1c31e731d82aa19d674","title":"tied up in knots why the humble scarf is your new style hero","story":"Moving beyond its primary role of keeping the neck warm, the silk scarf is now a way to add creative flair to any outfit• Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual style supplementA few scarves have made fashion’s history books.

They were sartorial foundations rather than afterthoughts. At Preen, floral scarves clashed against graphic tees and took inspiration from Japanese street culture.

Just metres away was a herd of eight horses. Before meeting them, advised therapist Lisanne Peters, it was wise to meditate. First, she told me to focus on sensations – the smell of hay the birdsong. Then she instructed me to imagine myself, centaur-like, “with another back and another set of legs behind you. Feel how sturdy, how grounded, you are.”This was the beginning of my equine therapy experience. I have never been a horse person but recently surprised myself by wanting to try it. Perhaps it was because I have felt as though lately I see horses everywhere, particularly in fashion. Gucci’s latest ad campaign, for example, imagines horses integrated in urban lives: models feed them in the supermarket and hose their hooves off with water on petrol station forecourts.At couture fashion week, in January, during the Franck Sorbier collection, two horses appeared on a catwalk flanked by hay bales. On the high street, Uniqlo promoted its collaboration with Inès de la Fressange with a picture of the French style arbiter walking a majestic, milk-white horse down a windswept beach. In menswear, the Charles Jeffrey Loverboy show was inspired by the Orkneys’ 200-year-old pagan ritual, the Festival of the Horse. Fashion’s most powerful models – Bella and Gigi Hadid – are avowed horse girls who post frequent selfies nuzzling long noses. Last summer, Maison Margiela’s couture show was dedicated to “a horse called Blue” that creative director John Galliano had met during three months of equine therapy in Arizona. This memory had bubbled up now, he said, in a podcast accompanying the show, because “I feel as though we are going through a survival mood and perhaps needing to revert back to trusting our instincts. You can’t lie to a horse, it’s so sensitive it feels any anxiety or fear.”Blinkers now off, I started to see the cowboy trend as a romanticisation of a time when human lives were enmeshed with horses’. It felt as though something was ahoof in the collective subconscious. I began to notice “equine therapy” briefly mentioned in spa break features in Vogue and in press releases for luxury retreats.Like “forest bathing” and other increasingly popular eco-therapies, equine therapy speaks to an interest in getting back to something fundamental. After all, humans lived with horses for thousands of years – it was only the advent of the motorcar that separated us. “They have been alongside us in evolution always,” Peters says. “There is that quote: ‘History is strewn with the bones of a horse.’” The connection, she believes, “is something very ancient that we need to get back to”.To be clear, while equine therapy might sound kooky and alternative, it has very serious applications. Peters’ centre – the Red Horse Foundation – specialises in trauma. Equine therapy is often used for addiction and to help children with autism and veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. Research is in its infancy (a 2015 paper reported that the studies so far are promising but limited) but it is available, in certain counties, on the NHS and through well-respected mental health centres. It’s worth noting, too – not least for the sake of safety – that Peters would not advise trying it out anywhere that does not have deep specialist knowledge.Still, Peters believes it can be useful for everyone, whether for leadership, team-building, anxiety or self-esteem: “It helps us to take control of our lives and our selves, like meditation, rather than letting external things take control of you – the horse is a master teacher for that.”Horses “are not goal oriented”, she explains. “They don’t have the frontal cortex over-thinking.” And as prey animals, relying on instinct for survival, they are “living biofeedback machines”, she says: “They can tell if you are not being authentic – if you are behaving one way but feeling another.” Great “horse people”, she says, can align “thinking, feeling and action – we call it becoming congruent” – at which point a horse will do anything for you.So far, my own equine therapy experience has given me plenty to chew on there were more metaphors and lessons for my busy life, overseeing the ’s fashion desk, than I could shake a riding crop at. I made a sub-City Slickers entrance for my first session, arriving at the tranquil centre demanding an iPhone charger and insisting I make an important phone call before we start. Twenty minutes later, however, within the field of horses, it was impossible not to slow down.Peters invites me to observe how peaceful the horses are, just being, just living. She asks if there are any I am drawn to and would like to meet. At first, they all look like horses to me. But gradually, I differentiate them. I choose a huge chesnut mare and try to say hi she walks away, to another pile of hay. (I try not to think: “But of course I am such a charisma vacuum that even a horse would not want to hang out with me.”) Eventually, I approach slowly from the side, on Peters’ advice. The horse turns her nose towards my fist I stroke her. “Now you have done a horse greeting,” Peters says.Much of my experience is like this: simply moving among the herd as though I am one of them. It takes some time for me to stop trying to smile to dispense with social niceties. It also takes time to stop feeling a bit judged when they appraise me based on my non-verbal cues, and walk away. It feels a bit like the way a PR with a clipboard at fashion week might coolly assess my status judging by my footwear and find me lacking. Gradually, though, I learn to be less person about it. Status anxiety is not very horse, after all. They accept what happens and move on. As I start to do the same, they seem happier to be around me.My next session is more active – and hugely illuminating. I try to lead the alpha male, Brannan, around the paddock. I assume he will play ball – I’ve seen this sort of thing on TV – but he doesn’t. As he resists, I feel a familiar sensation of not being entirely comfortable telling others what to do, something I can hide behind smiles at work. Brannan, however, reads me like a book. He ends up leading me, instead, back to the paddock entrance. I try again. He demures. Later, Peters advises me that this kind of exercise is “all about having an intention – knowing where you want to go. It’s about being comfortable with being the leader.” All of which sounds familiar.I’m surprised by how powerful hanging out with horses has been, and how clearly, and wordlessly, Brannan laid bare one of my issues. I’m not finished with him yet: I’ll be back for another session and will try to lead him again. With Peters’ help I’m sure I will succeed. I’ll be able to stand on my own feet once I’ve cracked it. All four of them.• Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual fashion supplement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbba751e6dc94ac0c5f9de7bcd592390d56bfd31/0_0_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73062c34e0529d073962ecb3bbaa60f1","title":"harvey weinstein jury deliberations trial verdict metoo","story":"Twelve New Yorkers will walk out of courtroom 99 on Tuesday to decide the case that triggered a movement Seven men and five women will be sent out of courtroom 99 at the New York supreme court on Tuesday carrying the fate of Harvey Weinstein and the #MeToo movement on their shoulders.The jury of 12 New Yorkers will begin a potentially testing deliberation on whether or not to find the disgraced movie mogul guilty of rape and sexual assault.Their collective decision could have monumental consequences. If they find the defendant guilty he could face a maximum sentence of life in prison.If they acquit, the failure to secure a conviction against a man who has been accused of alleged sexual misconduct by more than 100 women will send waves of shock and dismay throughout the fledgling #MeToo cause that was largely triggered by revelations involving Weinstein in 2017.The judge in the case, James Burke, will closely instruct the jury how to work through the five charges facing Weinstein, 67.First they must consider the evidence relating to the two main accusers.One is a woman who the  is not naming because her wishes over identification are not known. She alleges she was raped by Weinstein in a New York hotel, for which he has been charged with rape in the first and third degrees which carry a maximum sentence of 25 years.The second main accuser is Miriam Haley, a former Project Runway production assistant who alleges the fallen Hollywood producer forced oral sex on her in his SoHo apartment in 2006. The count of criminal sex act also carries a top sentence of 25 years.If the jury finds Weinstein guilty of the charges relating to either or both of the main accusers it can then move on to consider the final two counts: predatory sexual assault. To convict on these charges the jurors must find the movie producer guilty of sexually assaulting more than one woman.For these counts, prosecutors have invited them to consider the evidence of the best-known of the six women who have gone into the witness stand, the Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra. She gave harrowing testimony in which she described allegedly having her hands pinned above her head as she was held down on a bed and violently raped in her Gramercy Park apartment in the winter of 1993-94.Though the alleged incident is well beyond the statute of limitations, and thus cannot be prosecuted in its own right, it can speak to the accusation that Weinstein was a serial sex criminal contained in the sexual predatory assault charges. Those are the most serious counts of all, carrying a possible maximum sentence of life imprisonment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e314985ef65d709c605144ce563fd77c5621e229/177_166_1755_1054/master/1755.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3e87a9203597426f3f18015602abc9b","title":"chelsea manchester united premier league match report","story":"For Chelsea, it was a painful night in more ways than one. As if seeing Harry Maguire escape censure for studding Michy Batshuayi in a very private area was not bad enough, there was also the frustration of the VAR interventions that left Frank Lampard feeling sore after being beaten again by Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who celebrated a win built on dogged defending, Bruno Fernandes’s first assist in a Manchester United shirt and the sight of Anthony Martial rising to the occasion in the absence of the injured Marcus Rashford.It was a strange contest – Solskjær admitted his side were poor before Martial gave them the lead – and those tight refereeing calls are worth keeping in mind when it comes to analysing United’s fourth league win over another Big Six side this season.Lampard, furious that Maguire was still on the pitch to score United’s second goal, could not believe his misfortune. Nothing went right for Chelsea. N’Golo Kanté limped off early on, Kurt Zouma had an equaliser ruled out when a VAR review questionably detected a foul on Brandon Williams by César Azpilicueta and the technology intervened again when Olivier Giroud, standing with one foot in an offside position, headed past David de Gea in the dying stages.Away from the VAR debate, however, there was the more pressing matter of Solskjær outwitting Lampard for the third time this season. Chelsea, who have won four of their past 14 league games, could not complain too loudly.Their seventh home defeat under Lampard leaves them a point above Tottenham before hosting them on Saturday and three points above an average United side. Sheffield United are two points back in sixth place and, on this evidence, it is just as well that Manchester City’s troubles with Uefa means that finishing fifth could be enough to qualify for next year’s Champions League.This was yet another blunt display from Chelsea, who lacked dynamism in attack without the injured Tammy Abraham. Batshuayi toiled in place of Abraham, who remains troubled by the ankle injury he suffered against Arsenal last month, while the absence of Christian Pulisic and Callum Hudson-Odoi lessened Chelsea’s threat on the flanks, where fitful displays from Willian and Pedro showed why a deal is in place for Ajax’s Hakim Ziyech to move to Stamford Bridge in the summer.Injuries are stretching a tight squad and Chelsea, who host Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League next week, could have done without Kanté limping off with a sore adductor in the 12th minute. Andreas Christensen also had to go off at half-time, shortly after the centre-back had allowed Martial to glance home the opening goal.United, tough to break down in their 3-4-2-1 system, had offered little before edging ahead in the 45th minute, but Chelsea’s lack of decisiveness in both penalty areas always gives opponents a chance and they fell behind when Aaron Wan-Bissaka, turning Willian inside out on the right, delivered for Martial to flick a clever header beyond Willy Caballero.The French striker’s 13th goal of the season felt harsh on Chelsea. They had played the brighter football and the temperature rose when Batshuayi and Maguire set off in pursuit of a loose ball in the 20th minute. A shove from Batshuayi sent Maguire sprawling and the United centre-back was fortunate that a VAR review did not deem him guilty of violent conduct after kicking out at the Chelsea forward.Aggrieved not to be playing against 10 men, Chelsea briefly raised the tempo. Pedro dashed down the left and crossed for Batshuayi, who stabbed wide from 12 yards. Moments later Willian went over when Fernandes hung out a leg. The Brazilian was booked for ing and the half ended with Batshuayi fluffing another opening, dragging wide from a tight angle.It became an ordeal for Batshuayi, who lacks the smarts to ruffle composed centre-backs. While he is mobile, the Belgian is not as effective at linking the play as Abraham and his inability to protect the ball made life easier for United’s back three, where Eric Bailly was looking understandably rusty on his first start since last April.It was not Chelsea’s night. When Pedro’s close-range effort was deflected wide Zouma scored from the resulting corner, lashing a meaty volley past De Gea. Unfortunately for Chelsea, Brandon Williams was lying face down in the grass and United were appealing for a foul. Off it went for a review, which showed Azpilicueta had given Williams a little shove at the near post. The goal was scrubbed out, even though replays also revealed that Fred had pushed Azpilicueta first.Lampard fumed and the identity of United’s second goalscorer was another slap in the face. Fernandes lifted in a corner and Maguire rose highest, leaping above Antonio Rüdiger before pounding his header beyond Caballero.Batshuayi then made way for Giroud, who was eager to impress after being denied a move away from Chelsea last month, and the France striker thought he had pulled one back after converting Mason Mount’s cross. VAR had other ideas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997deaf2f85a10eea1bbd2da80f90cdbc4173592/235_4_4165_2499/master/4165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78988d5545c925dc2f5eff607ba87478","title":"jurgen klopp wants liverpool to show worth as european contenders","story":"Jürgen Klopp has said Liverpool return to the scene of their sixth European triumph not with the confidence of Champions League holders but to prove they are contenders to defend their crown in Istanbul.The reigning European champions face Atlético Madrid at Estadio politano on Tuesday 262 days after defeating Tottenham to win their latest Champions League title. Klopp has claimed Juventus and Paris Saint Germain are bigger favourites for this season’s competition than his runaway Premier League leaders, who will become the first English team in history to reach three consecutive European CupChampions League finals should they reach this season’s showpiece at the home of their 2005 triumph. But he admits there is no better place or opponent for Liverpool to reaffirm their European credentials than away at Diego Simeone’s Atlético.“We don’t feel like the winners of last year’s tournament, we feel like contenders for this year’s, and we want to show that,” the Liverpool manager said. “We want to be there in Istanbul if possible, and for that we know we have to work our socks off, historically and for us in general. That is exactly what we will do tomorrow and in the return leg.”Liverpool have never lost a knockout tie in Europe under Klopp – 10 fixtures in total – or a knockout tie in the Champions League since losing to Chelsea in the 2008-09 quarter-finals. “It’s impressive to be honest, that record,” admitted Klopp, who believes the fragile nature of the knockout stages adds an extra competitive edge to Liverpool’s game.“It looks like it,” he added “And some of the best games we played were away. Bayern was one of the best games I have ever witnessed, and so was Barcelona, even though we lost 3-0. If we can get a result, we know Anfield is a proper threat and a help. That’s the story so far. It doesn’t mean it will be the same this time. If there is a team where you have to be at your absolute best at all times, it’s Atlético because they give no presents. Absolutely no presents. If you work as hard as possible, then you have a chance. If you don’t do that, then you don’t even have a chance.“They defend in a specific way but on the other hand I don’t think they played against a team like us and we should not forget that. We combine a few things we are not badly organised we play football we have respect for different aspects of the game our readiness to fight is exceptional.”Klopp discounted Atlético’s struggles this season as the inevitable consequence of a transition season having lost several of the big-name talents that helped them to the 2014 and 2016 finals. And he retains firm admiration for Simeone, whose demonstrative touchline behaviour overshadows even that of the Liverpool manager.“People say I am emotional on the sideline,” said Klopp. “If I am level four I would say he is level 12. I am really like the kindergarten cop against him. He has been here eight years. That is really long, and still having this emotional level, wow. That is really impressive. His teams are always world-class organised. That makes him one of the best. We have exchanged messages after big games. We meet in a competitive game for the first time. It will be interesting, really interesting.”Trent Alexander-Arnold, who Cafu claimed at the weekend could win the Ballon d’Or, admits Liverpool know that one mistake against Atlético could signal the end of their dreams of a hat-trick of Champions League finals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1acee1fdcd72a115863b7c2e9ca02fc0cc63d4c3/0_65_2844_1707/master/2844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5c5eee94952c06ec2163137abc31e81","title":"manchester city sponsorship covered by abu dhabi government not etihad","story":"A consultants’ report written for the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi stated that the Abu Dhabi government, not Etihad airlines, was “covering” the sponsorship of Manchester City in 2010, according to a 2015 US aviation industry document.Uefa’s financial fair play compliance body, the CFCB, banned City from the Champions League for two seasons on Friday and fined the club €30m, having concluded the club was not being truthful in its submissions from 2012-16 that Etihad wholly funded its annual £67.5m sponsorship. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200217-58536-gnl.fw.20200217.jf.jarsofurine.mp3 City have furiously rejected the conclusion and suggestion that Etihad did not wholly fund the sponsorship, claiming that the CFCB’s two “chambers” were biased, “flawed,” had prejudged the outcome and had ignored “irrefutable evidence”.The US aviation industry document was produced in 2015 by the “Partnership for Open and Fair Skies”, an alliance of three major US airlines and aviation staff unions. They were arguing to the US departments of commerce, transportation and state that Etihad was receiving enormous subsidies from the Abu Dhabi government, which, they claimed, distorted fair competition. The document refers to an internal report on Etihad prepared for the Crown Prince, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, by consultants in 2010, which was leaked in 2014 to the Australian Financial Review. The consultants noted, in reference to a list of Etihad’s sponsorships: “Executive Council covers Man City”.The Executive Council is in effect the Abu Dhabi governing body and is chaired by the Crown Prince, who is widely considered the most powerful member of the ruling family. The senior business executive and political figure who was appointed to be City’s chairman after Mansour’s 2008 takeover, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, is a member of the Executive Council. He also chairs the Executive Affairs Authority, which advises on Abu Dhabi’s strategy and image, and works principally for the Crown Prince.Etihad denied that absolutely in their response to the US airlines’ allegations, submitted to the US departments in May 2015. The Abu Dhabi airline rejected the claim that its huge funding from the Abu Dhabi government represented subsidies and said of the City deal: “The assertion that the Abu Dhabi government paid for Etihad’s sponsorship of English Premier League football club Manchester City is equally false. In 2011 Etihad and Manchester City entered into a 10-year sponsorship agreement, which included naming rights for Manchester City’s stadium. Etihad funded this sponsorship from its own liquidity. It is not uncommon for airlines to have sponsorships with sports teams and their venues.”Etihad did not refer in that response to the consultants’ review or explain why the consultants had said “Executive Council covers Man City”.Following the publication of the internal City emails suggesting Mansour’s own company was heavily subsidising the sponsorship, Etihad responded by saying: “Etihad Airways is proud to have been Manchester City FC’s main club partner since May 2009. The airline’s financial obligations, associated with the partnership of the club and the broader City Football Group, have always been, and remain, the sole liability and responsibility of Etihad Airways. This is reflected in the airline’s audited accounts.”The airline’s audited accounts are not published but the US document published an apparent copy of the 2013-14 accounts that showed Etihad had accumulated losses of $3.8bn and had drawn down $5bn of loans from the Abu Dhabi government, which had also contributed a further $2.5bn in share capital. The accounts stated Etihad had spent a total of $150m during the year on advertising and promotion, although that was not itemised and the City sponsorship was not specifically referred to.City have denied throughout that Etihad’s sponsorship is subsidised and said they are to appeal against the Uefa CFCB conclusion and penalty to the court of arbitration for sport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ddf1f62130f6cde7a879a721a3d2f98bed2fb92/295_206_1369_822/master/1369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa8291b075e33f5895f543aed0b290c8","title":"can alexa help lower my screen time while keeping me connected","story":"With an Amazon Echo Dot at hand,  Alim Kheraj learns to break free of social media bad habitsI used to feel quite superior because of how little I relied on the tiny gods in our pockets – the devices that require so much time and devotion from everyone else. Then I started to get “screen time” notifications. This unwanted weekly intrusion was sobering: on average, I was using my phone for nearly four hours a day. And the bulk of that time was spent on social media.When I really thought about it, I could see how this came to be. Setting an alarm before bed turned into scrolling through Twitter for an hour checking the weather became a marathon Reddit session. All roads led back to social media, even if I’d picked up my phone with entirely different intentions.I was eager, then, to see if an Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa could change my behaviour. Reflecting on how I found myself inevitably in a social media hole whenever I used my phone, it felt logical that, if I could replace tasks I used my phone for with the smart speaker, I’d avoid wandering on to Twitter and ultimately prevent unnecessary phone time.When the Echo Dot arrived, I decided that the living room would be the best place for it. Setting it up was a doddle, although it did involve using my phone, but before long I had linked the speaker with my music streaming provider, my Audible account and had even saved recipes that I thought I might try during the week. That first evening – seduced by the allure of shiny new technology – I sat for two hours listening to podcasts on the sofa, my phone forgotten.Conscious that the Echo wasn’t there just to feed my true crime addiction, I scoped around to find out some other skills and tasks I could assign it. To prevent myself from waking up and looking up the news, weather and tube status on my phone, I decided to programme a morning routine – a set of Alexa’s commands triggered by a simple voice instruction. The next morning while having breakfast, I asked Alexa to “start my day”. First came a fact of the day, then the weather and finally the ’s news briefing, a 30-minute cut of the latest news, sport and reviews, read to you by Alexa.It was all very useful, but, being in a shared flat, having Alexa tell me the weather forecast out loud while my flatmate slept felt a little inconsiderate. And while I wish I had 30 minutes to spare to listen to a podcast each morning before leaving the house, it’s just not realistic. Like with any new addition to your home, Alexa and I needed to adjust.Diving back into the app, I reprogrammed my morning routine, replacing the news briefing with a mindfulness exercise. To get the news, I decided that I would use the  skill. The next morning, after being told that it was Britney Spears’s 38th birthday that day, I luxuriated in a minute’s worth of mindfulness, bathed in the soundscape of a forest, before asking Alexa to read me the headlines. When it was time to leave, I realised that I had only used my phone that morning to tweet a happy birthday to Ms Spears. Win.My phone use in the evening, however, was still a problem. Flatsharing means you have to be flexible, and arriving home after my flatmate I soon understood that it would be impossible to sit in the living room all night listening to audiobooks or podcasts or even doing Harry Potter trivia. I could hardly ask him to turn the TV off and vacate our shared space so I could listen to an episode of My Dad Wrote a Porno. So, the decision was made: I would take Alexa to my bedroom.Not only could I now set up alarms to wake me up, but I could also add little reminders each morning to water the plants or to not forget my phone charger before leaving the house without Alexa booming them out at 8am and freaking my housemate out. In the evenings, I found that I didn’t mind being holed up in my bedroom, as Alexa read me audiobooks and podcasts. As someone who needs background noise to sleep, I found that dozing off to a podcast was far more comfortable than wearing headphones in bed. I even added a sleep timer so that I didn’t miss anything when I eventually fell asleep.Most notable, though, was how easily using the Echo and Alexa replaced my phone. Sure, I was still drawn into the odd scour of Reddit and Twitter, but just asking Alexa to play me the latest episode of What Makes a Killer (yes, I know, not really light bedtime listening) instead of scoping it out on my phone before ultimately playing it while simultaneously bingeing on social media, meant I gave the podcast my full attention. I also didn’t fall asleep with my phone in my bed, either.It’s probably still too early to say that the Echo and Alexa have changed my life. But without doubt, it has shifted my behaviours. I make time in the mornings for mindfulness and engage properly, instead of just getting riled up by the latest scandal on Twitter. Mostly, though, it’s made me realise how much easier it is to find time in the day to take for yourself when you’re not sucked into hours scrolling on your phone. This week alone I’ve made my way through five hours of a new audiobook and my morning mindfulness is a revelation.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e460cabe205ee0b7a04f438880c42029253602/123_0_4684_2812/master/4684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c028194f426cd57626976192b11b85e7","title":"from ganafest to notte bianca your guide to maltas arts and culture festivals in 2020","story":"With events taking place across all seasons, there’s always a good time to visit MaltaThere’s always something happening in action-packed Malta.

Why Harry was left with no choice but to end it”.The Australian Press Council has ruled that Woman’s Day, which is a member of the self-regulatory body, was in breach of standards for accuracy for the headline, which was not backed up by the article.Even allowing for the latitude given for factual exaggeration and inaccuracies in publications of this kind, the magazine had crossed a line, the council said.The magazine, published by Bauer Media, had to publish the adjudication in print and online on Monday.“While an entertainment publication can be expected to use some exaggeration, the headline was expressed as an unqualified fact that the palace had confirmed the marriage was over,” the council said.“The council considers that the statement in the headline was such that it was more than just an exaggeration, and that it was misleading.“The council acknowledges that celebrity and gossip magazines are purchased for light entertainment, with readers not necessarily assuming that everything presented is factual.”The publisher told the press council that neither the royal family nor the couple had complained about the article so it had not been corrected.On 8 January Harry and Meghan announced that they planned to step back from senior roles in the royal family, in part because of their unhappiness about living life in the public spotlight. They have launched several defamation actions against the British press.The Woman’s Day article used several anonymous sources and alleged the duchess had an “online relationship” with the British singer Matt Cardle.Meghan, who has consistently attracted negative press, was accused of being “absent from royal duties”.“‘Until now Harry has been giving Meghan the benefit of the doubt’, says our source,” the article said.“‘But he’s only willing to take so much and it’s reached the stage where enough is truly enough.’”Woman’s Day argued that magazines trading in gossip and celebrity had readers who understood it was “light entertainment” and it would be “unreasonable to hold such publications to a standard similar to that of other news media”.“Readers should expect a level of exaggeration and a complaint could be made about almost every gossip magazine,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c962f8832255974de31d347cb890a3f03f695666/0_254_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9296d7ab731e5bb140e4563613d73014","title":"why no northern accents reading t news asks yorkshire poet","story":"Ian McMillan says north of England is a ventriloquist’s dummy voiced by the southThe north of England has been prominent in news bulletins all year, from the Tory demolition of Labour’s “red wall” to the wrangling over HS2 and the flooding in the Calder valley.Why then, the Yorkshire poet Ian McMillan has asked, are there no newsreaders with northern English accents?Writing in the Radio Times, McMillan said that although the north was now central to the news agenda, people from the area “can’t be trusted with t’autocue, tha knows”.He argued that while TV commissioners understood the importance of representing the north in drama – whether leafy south Manchester in Cold Feet or the love lives of ageing Yorkshire folk in Last Tango in Halifax – they are hesitant to employ people with northern accents to read the news.“Seismic and nuanced shifts in political culture are happening at the top end of England and this historic earth tremor will be rattling the pots on the sideboard for years to come,” he said.“The north is a ventriloquist’s dummy and the south is in control of the speaking mouth. Newsreaders from the north aren’t reading the news about themselves because, well, there aren’t any. And there haven’t been since the sainted Wilfred Pickles, unmistakably from Halifax, last read a bulletin on the Home Service during the second world war,” wrote McMillan, the author of Collins Chelp and Chunter: a Guide to the Tyke Tongue.“So, come on, people in charge: let a northern voice read the news, and not just the news about the north.”There have been prominent newsreaders with northern English heritage, such as the late Peter Sissons who grew up in Liverpool as a friend of the Beatles. But while a Welsh burr appears welcome on the News at Ten – at least when it belongs to Huw Edwards – Sissons had long cast off his scouse accent by the time he made it on air.When northerners do make it on to serious news programmes they are occasionally mocked for their accents. Reviewing Radio 4’s Any Questions? in the Sunday Times this weekend, Gillian Reynolds described the presenter Chris Mason as being “best known as a reliable political reporter with a slight speech defect and a faint Yorkshire impediment”.Mason, who grew up in Grassington, North Yorkshire, has previously spoken of how, in an age when there is a greater awareness that broadcasting needs to sound like its audience, speaking like a northerner helped him get the job.Shortly after taking over as presenter of Any Questions? last November – a marked change from his predecessor, Jonathan Dimbleby – he told the Radio Times: “When have you ever heard on a news programme somebody with a West Country accent? I can’t think of a single person, and that’s mad. How many people with a Brummie accent? Or a geordie accent?“There’s hardly any. It’s absolutely absurd. We’re broadcasting to a country with this incredibly rich ersity of voices and accents, and we hardly hear any of them broadcasting on the national airwaves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8ca222a0b08012ac1de880c6ffda6b345085b0a/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf1ab4c6b2a901ed43ea928894c2e0f6","title":"nsi announce interest rate reductions for 25m customers","story":"Changes will take effect from May hitting premium bonds and savings accountsMillions of savers are to be hit by a series of interest rate reductions announced by the Treasury-backed savings giant NS\u0026ampI.The institution, which has 25 million customers and a duty to balance the needs of savers, taxpayers and the wider market, said the changes would take effect from May. They include making the premium bonds prize fund rate less generous.“This is another kick in the teeth for savers,” said Baroness Altmann, the former pensions minister.The Times quoted her as saying: “Many people, especially older generations, have used NS\u0026ampI all their lives and know it is safe, so they want to keep their money in those accounts … It seems the government is sanctioning rate cuts in NS\u0026ampI that will allow banks to continue to offer very poor rates without driving more savers away.”The odds of any £1 bond number winning any prize will decrease from 24,5001 to 26,0001 from the May 2020 draw onwards.

Beethoven’s setting of it as the last movement of his Ninth Symphony has always been so, even if to Europeans it feels more politically charged now than ever before. It should always feel radical in a live performance, and that’s what Simon Rattle achieved here with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. One was never quite sure what was going to happen next.Sometimes the best Beethoven performances have the feeling of there being a ticking motor behind the music, something carrying it along with absolute security. This one didn’t. The opening pages pitted agitated strings that wanted to speed up against a wind theme that wanted to slow things down. There were fleeting moments of messiness. Impetus would wane slightly only to be reaffirmed, making the whole thing feel slightly volatile.There was much that was fierce: the long chord that drove its way through from the background like a snowplough the thunder-roll of timpani as the first theme returned. The ferocity took a step back when we got to the glowing slow movement, but those expansive melodies were still something to be fought for. The Ode brought emphatic, communicative singing from the chorus and a quartet of soloists including baritone Florian Boesch and tenor Robert Murray it ended in a jubilant blaze, but the most striking moment had come with the very first entry of the theme, on cellos and basses, which Rattle held to such a hush that it seemed to be coming from beyond some far horizon.Iwona Sobotka, who soared through the Beethoven solo soprano lines, had in the first half been the soloist in Berg’s Lulu Suite, her tone luscious, her highest notes teetering on the edge of vulnerability. From the opening moments, glowing with longing and tenderness, to the way the strings dug deep for the elegiac final movement, the orchestra’s performance was one of heightened colour and feverish energy – an unlikely springboard for the Beethoven, but in context an effective one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5a7bdbdd9c36ec6fa8826d9983af06acd42301/0_63_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb6fc52fb428f0da1141b5908121dfaf","title":"readers tributes andrew weatherall wonderfully creative dj","story":"The British DJ, remixer and record producer has died aged 56.

His work with Primal Scream on what eventually became Screamadelica opened up a whole new world of music, which led to me making lifelong friends and becoming who I am today. Thinking about it he probably impacted my actual life more than any other artist, something I hadn’t realised until learning of his passing. A really important artist for a whole generation of Brits. marmalade166Bloody hell. What a shame ... one of the pioneers. The Boy’s Own parties and Shoom will remain fondly in my memories. Crazy hedonistic times. The wonderful “ East Grinstead “ party probably the best of all. You could always count on Andy to push it all a little bit left field. Good times, good people. hucklehuckleMore years ago than I care to remember he played my home town as the “support” for Airstream. Two local guys who thought they knew it all wandered up to the DJ booth and told Weatherall: “I own that record ... you’re playing it at the wrong speed.”“How much did you pay in lads? A fiver?” Hands them their money back and tells them they can go now. Brilliant moment from someone who always did what he wanted. I’ve pretty much retired from clubbing but my last excursion was to ALFOS. Still had it. CrankyguyGenuine loss to the music world. A pioneer who gave me so much inspiration and good times. A great influence on the soundtrack of my life. Thanks AW. A safe onward journey to you. PiesRniceAndy Weatherall changed my life twice: once with Loaded, and the second time many years later, when I was writing for much-missed dance mag Muzik. We ran a regular feature called Do Us a Tape, where we’d get DJs to do just that. Usually it was just a bunch of “now” tunes they’d thrown together on a C90, but when I turned up to Weatherall’s studio, he’d prepared a double CD called The Reasons Are which was full of tracks that had influenced him. On it were Big Youth, African Head Charge, Hendrix, Miles Davis, Beefheart, Model 500, PiL … loads more.We spent a good three hours playing and talking through each track, with Weatherall saying things like, “You can practically hear the damp in the studio on this track,” and me becoming increasingly aware that my musical horizons were being expanded there and then. Simply put, to hear him enthuse about the tracks that had inspired him changed the way that I thought about music for good, and had a profound effect on my record collection.After the interview he played me a mix he was doing of Primal Scream’s Autobahn 66. The combination of the exclusivity, the studio sound system and the fact that I was standing next to Weatherall … I was practically levitating. JoeMeekTruly one of the greatest talents of his era. He could turn his hand to anything and make it sound amazing. Two Lone Swordsmen, one of my favourite albums when travelling, was genius though it sounded just as good played at 45 v 33, I think it was intentional. whatwouldattleedoOne of the greatest, loved his Sabres of Paradise stuff and of course Screamadelica but for me his My Bloody Valentine remixes such as Soon and Glider have always held a special place … God bless Andy and enjoy the big rave in the sky! phoenix13What Andrew W did with Screamadelica is a wondrous addition to music that will ensure that that album is played for many generations to come. As a DJ hobbyist, I have played it to people both here and abroad, along with their later effort Vanishing Point, and more often than not it gets people moving and embracing the mood. Both great albums. Hope he keeps spinning as he’s movin’ on up. YodafoneyI had the pleasure of playing a gig with Andy at Brixton Academy, he wiped the floor with me. A wonderfully creative DJ with no boundaries, a giant sense of the ridiculous in life and a friend to all, he really just couldn’t stop with the tunes … bye bye Andy, you were really one of a kind. stevebarkerAwful news. Safe to say he was a hell of a lot more than just the producer of Screamadelica – which is essentially a Weatherall album with Primal Scream as guests. Morning White Dove, the album he made with One Dove is just as good. Everything he touched he made better, more interesting, more weird. His brilliant remixes show that he saw things in music that no one else did, and his 1993 Essential Mix remains an education in the art of being a DJ. Devastating.

The study had MPs discuss particular experiences.Dawn Butler, who is standing to be Labour’s deputy leader, said she had once been removed from a room in parliament by police. “A police officer came to physically escort me out of the member’s tea room even though he was told I was a member of parliament,” the Brent Central MP said, adding that the officer later sent her a written apology.Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, told ITV that when she was pregnant a colleague had expressed surprise to be told Siddiq was having a daughter, as she thought people from Asian backgrounds were likely to abort girls.Siddiq said: “Speaking to a colleague of a mine, she looked at me in astonishment and said: ‘You know you’re having a girl, because normally they don’t tell people of Asian origin they’re having a girl because you know, then Asian people decide …’ And I looked at her and I couldn’t believe what she was saying.”Siddiq added that when she was first running for parliament someone advised her to use her husband’s surname, because “people wouldn’t vote for ‘Tulip Siddiq’”.Comments from MPs who asked to remain anonymous included one who said they had been spat at in the street because of their religion.

But he insisted that the ability to break free from the EU’s rulebook was essential to the purpose of Brexit and that the UK’s position would be tabled in “written form” next week. “We are not looking for anything special,” he said.Frost, a former ambassador to Denmark, went on to reject suggestions that the European court of justice would supervise any “level playing field” conditions designed to ensure that neither side undercuts the other.He also said that the UK would not take part in any EU programmes or agencies that put the country under the jurisdiction of the EU court.“We bring to the negotiations not some clever tactical positioning but the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country,” he said. “It is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us – to claim the right that every other non-EU country in the world has.”The EU’s negotiating mandate is due to be finalised on 25 February. A draft document published this month indicated that Brussels would seek at least “non-regression” from current environmental, social and workers’ standards once the UK has left the single market and customs union on 31 December 2020.The bloc is also likely to demand “dynamic alignment” by the UK on the EU’s state aid and competition rules. The UK would establish an independent body overseeing the rules but it would work in cooperation with the European commission. The European court of justice would be the final arbiter of EU law.The EU has argued that the need to maintain standards is keener in the case of Britain due to its proximity to the European market.Johnson said in a recent speech in Greenwich that he would rather accept heavy tariffs on goods being traded than sign up to anything so onerous.Frost said in Brussels: “Regulations and regulatory decisions are so fundamental to the way the population of a territory feels bound into the legitimacy of its government that this structure would be simply unsustainable: at some point democratic consent would snap – dramatically and finally.”He went on: “It isn’t a simple negotiating position which might move under pressure, it is the point of the whole project. That’s also why we will not extend the transition beyond the end of this year. At that point we recover our political and economic independence in full. Why would we want to postpone it?“In short, we only want what other independent countries have. Boris Johnson’s speech in Greenwich two weeks ago set out a record of consistently high standards of regulation and behaviour in the UK, in many cases better than EU norms or practice. How would you feel if the UK demanded that, to protect ourselves, the EU dynamically harmonise with our national laws set in Westminster and the decisions of our own regulators and courts?”Frost offered an opening, however, for the two sides to develop the models of free trade agreements that the EU has signed with Canada, South Korea and Japan. Those agreements include provisions that prevent either side from ignoring or lowering labour standards to boost trade. They also provide for both sides to consult with each other on subsidies and find solutions where such state aid creates unfair competition.Frost said: “The reason we expect – for example – open and fair competition provisions based on free trade agreement precedent is not that we want a minimalist outcome on competition laws. It is that the model of an FTA and the precedents contained in actual agreed FTAs are the most appropriate ones for the relationship of sovereign entities in highly sensitive areas relating to how their jurisdictions are governed and how their populations give consent to that government.“So if it is true, as we hear from our friends in the commission and the 27, that the EU wants a durable and sustainable relationship in this highly sensitive area, the only way forward is to build on this approach of a relationship of equals.”Frost said that he personally believed that Britain’s exit from the EU had been “inevitable” and that he hoped to dissuade the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, from the view that Brexit was about “damage limitation”.Describing Treasury predictions in 2018 about the economy after Brexit as “speculative”, Frost said the studies exaggerated the impact of non-tariff barriers and customs costs to businesses and failed to recognise the likely upside of an increase in productivity.He said: “There is obviously a one-off cost from the introduction of friction and a customs and regulatory border but I am simply not convinced it is anything like the scale of effect that these studies suggest …“It’s possible to be political partner and economic competitor. Economic competition boosts wealth for everybody in the long run and the more genuine economic competition across Europe, but it’s not competition for low standards …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9654d4ca617d621ca164ef98fda91ba1d408c1/0_60_3564_2138/master/3564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26b611a11b36a4384db5452ab4900f87","title":"sadiq khan urges eu to offer britons associate citizenship","story":"Guy Verhofstadt’s idea would give continued freedom of movement to those who wanted it﻿The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will use a trip to Brussels to implore EU negotiators to be open to continued free movement for Britons through “associate citizenship”.With the backing of the former prime minister of Belgium Guy Verhofstadt, Khan said the offer of such rights to those who wish to retain them should be at “the heart” of the coming negotiations over the future relationship.The idea of “associate citizenship” was first raised in late 2016 by Verhofstadt, who was then the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator.The offer would be of continued freedom of movement and residence around the bloc for those who wished to retain such rights. Such a status would also protect rights in healthcare, welfare and workplace conditions and likely the right to vote in European parliament elections.The chances of such an initiative making headway in the negotiations are extremely limited as it would be unlawful under EU legislation.There is unlikely to be appetite for any rewriting of treaties among the 27 member states, given the UK government’s hostile attitude to the free movement of EU nationals who wish to live and work in Britain.After 47 years and 30 days it is all over. As the clock strikes 11pm on Friday, the UK is officially orced from the EU and will begin trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Here’s a run-through the beginning, the middle and the end.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.Sir Edward Heath\u0026nbspsigns the accession treaty giving entry to the EEC in an official ceremony that was accompanied by a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.\u0026nbspDavid Cameron returns with reform package.Khan, who will also meet the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the European parliament’s president, David Sassoli, during his visit on Tuesday, said he believed the idea still had merit.“Like so many Londoners, I am heartbroken that we are no longer a member of the European Union, but that doesn’t mean our country’s future can’t be closely linked with the rest of Europe,” he said.“The prime minister says his job is to bring the country together and move us forward and I cannot think of a better way of reconciling the differences between British voters who wanted to leave, and the millions of Londoners and British nationals who still feel and want to be European.”Khan added: “There would be support from millions of Londoners and British nationals who are devastated they are losing their rights as EU citizens. As the UK and EU start their next phase of negotiations, I want this issue of associate citizenship to be at the heart of talks about our future relationship.”Attempts by UK nationals in EU member states to argue in the courts that the loss of citizenship and its associated rights was a disproportionate and unjust consequence of Brexit have all failed.Verhofstadt, who has the backing of the European parliament to be chair of a new conference on the future of Europe involving all the EU institutions, said he believed that Brussels should be open to the concept.“The Maastricht treaty created the concept of ‘European citizenship’ and I am in favour of using this now as a basis for people who want to keep their link with Europe,” he said. “It is the first time in the history of our union that a member state leaves, but it is not because the UK government wanted exit that inidual citizens have to lose their connection with the continent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1daa6b2e1573ff2b9c420cfa7c048681372a09c6/0_219_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13828cc3336fd6bc076d7d9418a99f0a","title":"do you have a job but struggle to make ends meet","story":"If you are working but your wages don’t cover your living costs, we’d like to hear from you.

Where does the truth lie? By  Sarah BoseleyGone With the Smoke is already no more than a distant whiff of bubblegum-flavoured vapour. The vape shop and lounge, one of many in San Francisco, has been forced to close. So have Vapor Den (“eclectic lounge \u0026amp hipster go-to”) and Happy Vape. From late January, it became illegal to sell e-cigarettes and e-liquids in San Francisco. Even online sales to addresses within the city limits have been stopped. Stores outside the city that dispatch e-cigarettes to an SF postcode will face prosecution.While vaping is banned, sales of legal marijuana and tobacco will continue as usual. San Francisco has often been considered more progressive than the rest of the US in its approach to drugs and unorthodox lifestyles: marijuana was legalised in California for medical use in 1996, after a campaign by Aids activists from the city, and for recreational use in 2016. Vaping, on the other hand, has crossed a line.“San Francisco has never been afraid to lead. That will always be the case when the health of our children is on the line,” announced the San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera in a statement after the ban was passed by the the city legislature last June. He was scathing about the FDA’s failure to control e-cigarette sales. “Now, youth vaping is an epidemic. If the federal government is not going to act to protect our kids, San Francisco will,” he said.A transatlantic schism has opened up over vaping and health. In the US, the war on vaping is being pursued by activists, politicians and scientists who believe that tobacco companies are cynically promoting e-cigarettes as a means to get people addicted to nicotine, which will – sooner or later – lead them to cigarettes. In the UK, anti-smoking campaigners and health experts counter that for many adult smokers, vaping offers the best hope of avoiding a premature death.Prof Ann McNeill of King’s College London, a tobacco and addiction expert who advises PHE, defends its position. “We are battling against misinformation on a massive scale,” she says. McNeill acknowledges there has been a rise in vaping among kids in the US and Canada, but does not see it as a reason for panic. “I don’t think it merits discussion of an ‘epidemic’. That word is overblown,” she said.There was fresh alarm in the US last year when 2,500 cases of lung disease and 55 deaths were associated with vaping. E-cigarettes work by heating liquid containing nicotine to produce vapour, which is then inhaled. There is no smoke or tar involved, but there are small amounts of chemical flavourings, including diacetyl, which has been linked to lung disease, and propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin. If the e-liquid overheats, formaldehyde can be formed. In fact, none of these chemicals were to blame in these cases – it turned out that the people who fell ill were using bootleg devices containing cannabis – but the reputational damage was done.In the wake of this alarming spate of hospitalisations and deaths, the New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, took emergency action in September, attempting to ban flavoured e-cigarette products. President Trump entered the fray, telling the FDA to act and imposing a temporary ban on any flavours that might appeal to young people. In December, New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, signed a law banning flavours. “Manufacturers of fruit and candy-flavoured e-cigarettes are intentionally and recklessly targeting young people,” said Cuomo, citing flavours including bubblegum, cotton candy and Captain Crunch. The state ban was overturned in January 2020 by Justice Catherine Cholakis, who said it was an overreach.In the UK, the NHS continues to edge as close as it can to approving the use of e-cigarettes to quit smoking. NHS hospitals in the West Midlands have sanctioned vape stores on the premises, while PHE launched, via YouTube, a video showing two white-coated experts with bell jars demonstrating how e-cigarettes are free of all the disgusting and damaging tar in a conventional cigarette.The science is furiously disputed. Academics on both sides are accused of cherry-picking data to suit their own prejudices. PHE is a global authority on health issues such as vaccination and obesity, but on vaping, it is looking increasingly isolated. Deborah Arnott, head of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) in the UK, says that Britain is losing ground in the e-cigarette debate because of the virulent campaign in the US against vaping. “The noise is causing problems in how we are perceived,” Arnott said. “We’re being written off.”What should be settled by science has become a clash of faiths. In the US, the debate is dominated by those who believe people should “just say no” to drugs. In the UK, there is more support for the idea of “harm reduction”, in which addicts take controlled amounts of their drug, be it alcohol, heroin or in this case, nicotine, to keep them stable.PHE’s support for e-cigarettes as a tool to help people quit smoking is shared by other respected health bodies, such as the Royal College of Physicians and Cancer Research UK. They point out that the UK regulates smoking and vaping far more rigorously than the US. The UK has rules on age, and health warnings, and caps on the nicotine content. Marketing to young people is forbidden – e-cigarettes cannot be advertised on TV. There is less nicotine in Juul pods or e-cigarette cartridges sold in the UK: Juul in the US contains up to 59mg per ml, while nicotine levels in e-cigarettes across Europe are capped at 20mg per ml by an EU directive enshrined in British law. In the US, at this point, there is no middle ground between unrestricted sales and an outright ban.All sides agree that vaping nicotine is safer than getting it from cigarettes. Nicotine by itself is “relatively harmless”, according to the NHS, while the harm from cigarettes is in the smoke produced by burning tobacco and the residue of tar it leaves, which damages the airways, causing lung disease and cancer.“People smoke for nicotine but they die from the tar,” wrote Michael Russell, a professor in addiction at the Institute of Psychiatry in London and a pioneer of harm reduction, in 1976. His work laid the foundations for the introduction of nicotine replacement therapy – the nicotine patches and gum the NHS hands out today.Russell, who died in 2009, wanted to develop a low-tar cigarette that would be high in nicotine, to give smokers the hit they wanted without inhaling more deeply. His research on the low tar product was funded by the tobacco company RJ Reynolds, now owned by British American Tobacco (BAT). This relationship with a tobacco company, which Russell later claimed was normal practice at the time, is now seen as fatally compromising. It has since been used to undermine his research and attack his reputation.Ann McNeill, who worked with Russell as a young researcher, believes he was ahead of his time. “His pioneering research improved the quality of life of smokers and saved the lives of many more,” she said in a paper celebrating Russell, co-written with Debbie Robson of the UK Centre for Tobacco \u0026amp Alcohol Studies. “It is a sad indictment of our community that his work is still not recognised adequately by all those working in tobacco control, some of whom still fail to recognise the centrality of nicotine in tobacco use and the implications of this.”Anti-tobacco activists – whether they are for or against e-cigarettes – believe they are defending the gains they have made in the battle against smoking. Vaping’s defenders say the tobacco firms are ersifying into a product that won’t kill their customer base. Hardline opponents are convinced e-cigarette sales will keep the hated tobacco companies in business.Most scientists and health campaigners in the US will have no dealings with the tobacco industry, because of its history of devious marketing practices and underhand tactics. Under the terms of a World Health Organization (WHO) treaty in the early 00s, governments agree not to have any discussions with tobacco industry representatives (over trade terms, for example, taxation, regulation or investment). But anti-smoking campaigners now fear that, by promoting the benefit of their e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking, tobacco companies are acquiring respectability. WHO shares that anxiety and has advised measures to control e-cigarettes. Many countries, including Brazil, Thailand, Singapore, the Seychelles and Uruguay, have banned e-cigarettes as a result, while others have imposed regulations limiting their use.A number of health professionals and academics have dedicated their careers to exposing lies about the safety of tobacco products and stopping the promotion of cigarettes around the world. Recent hard-won victories include smoking bans in public spaces and plain packaging with severe health warnings. Despite their efforts, there are still over 1 billion smokers in the world. The global cigarette market was worth $888bn (£682bn) in 2018 and forecast to rise to $1,124bn by 2024.Stanton Glantz, professor of medicine at the Center for Tobacco Control, Research and Education at the University of California San Francisco, is the loudest of the anti-tobacco lobbyists – in his choice of Hawaiian shirts as well as his pronouncements. Glantz claims he was agnostic when e-cigarettes first appeared. He isn’t now. In December, he tweeted: “Using e-cigs increases exposure to toxic chemicals for most users they would be better off just smoking.”This was a new extreme, even for Glantz. Alex Berezow, vice-president of scientific affairs at the American Council on Science and Health, described the tweet as “mind-boggling”. “Unfortunately, Dr Glantz has become something of an ideologue. His (justifiable) animosity toward the tobacco industry has been turned (unjustifiably) to other industries, such as vaping,” he wrote on his blog. The research paper that had prompted Glantz’s tweet, Berezow pointed out, actually shows that e-cigarette users get less exposure to toxic chemicals than tobacco smokers – not more.Glantz, who you have to interrupt if you want to ask a question, told me that in the tweet, he was talking about dual-users – people who are both smoking and vaping. “Maybe it was worded inarticulately,” he conceded. But he won’t back down. He claims the evidence suggests that most people are dual users (in the UK, about a third of vapers are still smoking as well, according to a survey by YouGov).“The Nutt paper had no evidence whatsoever. It was 12 guys who sat around and pulled that number out of the air,” said Glantz. “The most generous thing you can say about that paper is that it was much earlier in the process and there wasn’t a lot of evidence out there.” He believes the credibility of Nutt’s group has been undermined by revelations that they were part-funded by a consultancy called EuroSwiss Health, run by Delon Human, a South African doctor who has accepted funding from BAT for some of his ventures.Nutt, a professor in neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, says he is “saddened” by Glantz’s attacks. “He was a hero of mine. He was one of the pioneers in demolishing the myth that tobacco wasn’t addictive and opposing the fraud and misinformation and lies of the tobacco industry. But the problem is he is still basically playing the same tune and we’re now in a different era.” It’s proven impossible to stop people selling tobacco, Nutt said. “So the anti-tobacco people have got to attack something else, because that’s what they do – they attack and they ban. So basically they’ve fixed their wagons against vaping because it is one thing they can ban, and they’re very successful. It’s laughable that in India people go to prison for selling vaping when the government allows advertising of tobacco.”Glantz became an icon of the anti-tobacco movement after he received 4,000 leaked documents from Brown and Williamson, then the US’s third-biggest tobacco company, in 1994. They proved the industry knew that smoking caused cancer and had hidden it. Since then, Glantz has always objected vigorously to any compromise with the industry. In 1997, a deal was broached with the tobacco industry by Matt Myers of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. It would have brought in tight federal regulatory control of cigarettes, prohibiting the sort of advertising and marketing that is still ubiquitous in the US, as well as sales to children. But Glantz was opposed to any deal that would allow cigarette manufacturers to continue in business. His goal was to close them down altogether. Myers was stymied by his own allies, and the US still does not have the anti-tobacco regulations that are common in Europe.Myers is calm and quietly authoritative. He is not against harm reduction, he says. Nor are other public health bodies such as the American Cancer Society or the American Heart Association. “All of us have said that under appropriate circumstances, if e-cigarettes are shown to actually significantly help smokers quit or switch completely, and that there are rules in place to prevent them being marketed in a way that doesn’t unduly impact youth, we would be supportive,” he said.Up until now, on a national level, the US has had no regulatory control of e-cigarette sales, marketing, minimum age, or limits on nicotine content. “It’s the wild west,” said Myers. Tobacco-Free Kids has brought legal action against the FDA over its failure to regulate e-cigarette use and last year won a ruling from a federal judge that there was no excuse for further delay. The e-cigarette companies are irresponsible too, Myers added.In March 2018, Myers and Glantz, as well as representatives of PHE and almost every other influential anti-smoking scientist or campaigner, attended the World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Cape Town – just up the road from BAT’s South Africa HQ. At this meeting, held every two years, activists can discuss the perfidy of the industry, celebrate their successes and plan for the future.Nobody connected with the tobacco industry is allowed in the building. Clause 5.3 of the WHO’s Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, which came into force in 2005, lays down recommended anti-smoking measures for governments, from taxing cigarettes to marketing controls and smoking bans in enclosed public places. It has been signed by 168 countries (the US is a notable exception). Clause 5.3 says governments “need to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or subvert tobacco control efforts” and must limit their contact to the absolute minimum. Activists now take this to mean there must be an impenetrable wall between themselves and anyone in any way connected with tobacco.The man who did as much as anyone to establish the Framework Convention while an executive director of WHO, Derek Yach – originally from Cape Town but now based in the US – finds himself on the wrong side of that wall. Yach was pointedly excluded from the conference in his home city – and yet much of the conversation was about him. Yach had done the unthinkable: accepting almost $1bn over 12 years from Philip Morris, makers of Marlboro and other leading brands, to set up his Foundation for a Smokefree World in New York in 2017 to fund research into alternatives to tobacco.Yach believes it’s in the tobacco companies’ interests to develop products that will leave conventional cigarettes behind. His erstwhile colleagues believe he is working for the devil. Why, they ask, does Philip Morris still sell cigarettes if it cares about the world’s health?As rumours circulated that Yach was in the building or lurking outside, Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York and funder of vast amounts of anti-tobacco science and programmes, was launching his own campaign. Striding down the hallway, flanked by purple banners emblazoned with the words Bloomberg Philanthropies, the financial backer of the conference and his entourage made their way to the TV cameras to discuss his Stop initiative. Bloomberg announced he has set aside $20m to counter the lies of the tobacco industry. Top of the watch list was Yach’s Foundation.Bloomberg helps pay for WHO’s work on tobacco. I was offered a five-minute audience – just long enough to ask if he thinks there’s a role for e-cigarettes in combating smoking. “It is like marijuana: one of the stupid things we’re doing is legalising it,” he said. “I think there’s no place for e-cigarettes. I think it’s a terrible idea.”Yach claims that “A-grade scientists and researchers around the world” are picking up grants from his foundation and doing useful work, but few believe he can succeed. He admits he was taken aback by the strength of feeling. “I wasn’t completely naive about it, but I didn’t actually appreciate how harsh it would be, particularly from a pretty small bunch of people who have incredible influence at WHO,” he says.Clive Bates, the former head of the UK’s Ash, who blogs and campaigns for e-cigarettes from his home in Nigeria – he is married to the British High Commissioner – said he was amazed by the anti-vaping anger in Cape Town. “It was like a cult, almost,” he said. “Particularly the attacks on the foundation. It’s quite an achievement for Derek to create an institution that has a worse reputation than Philip Morris.”In the UK, a small number of prominent public health academics vehemently oppose e-cigarettes. Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool, believe the tobacco companies are using e-cigarettes as a route back to respectability. Sally Davies, until recently the UK’s chief medical officer (the most senior government adviser on public health matters), backs a ban on flavours that might attract children. She’s worried that we don’t know the long-term health effects of vaping, which she described as a “ticking time bomb”.Ann McNeill says there is not much growth in vaping among kids in the UK. Her key concern would be a rise in vaping among young people who have never smoked, but there’s no sign of that. She thinks the key to reducing youth uptake is “getting adult smoking down”, because young people tend to imitate their elders’ behaviour. Of course, it did not satisfy the critics. When the researchers went back to the subjects after a year, most of the e-cigarette group were still vaping, whereas few of the ex-smokers in the other group were still chewing gum. So, they insisted, the study showed just how addictive e-cigarettes are.Juul, once the leading e-cigarette, is struggling against public outrage and bad press. Sales have dropped and hundreds of staff have been laid off. The company said to be worth $38bn in 2018 was written down to $24bn by Altria in October last year, and valued at just $19bn by one of its major investors, Tiger Global Management, in December.In the storm over child users, and anticipating an FDA ban, Juul stopped selling its fruit medley and mango flavours in the US in October and even dropped mint the following month. In January, the FDA acted, banning all flavours except tobacco and menthol from e-cigarettes that use a cartridge – as the Juul devices do. These are the devices kids use, said the FDA: flavours will not be banned from the refillable e-cigarettes that are more popular with adults. The FDA is also finally getting going on regulation, and has instructed manufacturers of e-cigarettes to apply for a right to trade by May.The WHO, taking its cue from the US and from Bloomberg, has advised countries to control vaping, warning about the unknown impact on health and stating that e-cigarettes are risky for teenage brains, as well as for the foetus. That may leave the UK isolated, a lone bastion where (highly regulated) vaping is actually encouraged in the hopes of cutting smoking rates. Many public health experts in the UK believe they are witnessing an unnecessary tragedy, and that failure to promote the most promising method of helping people quit smoking is endangering the lives of millions.McNeill insists public health experts in the UK do care about young people. But those whose lives are at risk are adults living in disadvantaged communities, who cannot kick their smoking habit. “I have lived with smokers and watched smokers die. You want them to do anything they can to prevent them from smoking.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f349c55cb9a5a291d43808345b146353d9198b8/586_779_3939_2363/master/3939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afbfca2c028f97e837515561caa38411","title":"moeen ali named as birmingham phoenix captain for the hundred","story":"Moeen Ali has been named captain of the Birmingham Phoenix men’s team for the inaugural season of The Hundred. The England all-rounder grew up less than two miles from Edgbaston and, though he left Warwickshire in 2006 to further his career, he remains one of the second city’s most recognisable sporting residents and a role model for its British Asian community.Moeen, who captained Worcestershire to the T20 Blast title in 2018 and last year’s runners-up position, said: “Every time that I come to Edgbaston it takes me back to some great first memories of coming here at a very young age.“I grew up in this area and to be the first men’s captain of Birmingham Phoenix in a new and inclusive competition that will reach out to communities and welcome them in is very special for me.“We’re a tight-knit city in Birmingham. We have so much around us that brings the people together, no matter who you are or your background. I know how much of a uniting game cricket is and as a leader of the Birmingham Phoenix that is something I definitely want to promote.”Moeen, who will earn a £10,000 captaincy bonus on top of his £125,000 deal as one of the team’s local icon players, was awarded the role by the team’s head coach, Andrew McDonald, in preference to another Birmingham-born England cricketer in Chris Woakes and New Zealand’s Kane Williamson.McDonald said: “Moeen is a fantastic all-rounder and has the experience and temperament to lead the team. He started his cricket journey here at Edgbaston from a young age, so it feels fitting that he will captain the men’s Birmingham Phoenix team.“He’s involved in the local community in Birmingham and I know how much of a popular figure he is at Worcestershire too so I’m sure his efforts on and off the field will help inspire the next generation from our region and beyond to get involved in cricket.”It remains to be seen what the move means for Moeen’s Test career, with the all-rounder currently on a self-imposed break from the longest format and The Hundred clashing with Pakistan’s Test series in England this summer.Moeen is due to begin a spell with Multan Sultans in the Pakistan Super League this week, having turned down a spot on England’s upcoming tour of Sri Lanka, and will then spend the early part of the home summer playing in the Indian Premier League."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0daf9002bbf54ce8211a62204eb647cbffd4e47a/32_0_3437_2063/master/3437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ddd6b81769c9ae5880c309146d3f2d7","title":"talking horses brian hughes given three day ban for weighing in light","story":"The jockey is chasing a first jump championship but was found in breach when weighed at Carlisle after winning the raceEwart added that such a thing has never happened with one of his horses before. Hughes has been through something similar, when Brian Boranha was disqualified at Catterick in 2016. On that occasion, he received no ban, as a hole was discovered in the weigh cloth, proving the cause of the weight loss. It is expected Hughes will argue at his appeal that he did nothing wrong on this occasion either and Ewart’s evidence will presumably be used to back that up.The outcome may matter enormously to this season’s title race, as Hughes has not yet built an unassailable lead over Richard Johnson, who is expected to return to action within the next three weeks. With two months left in the season, Hughes is ahead by 17 winners.Despite the victory of Espoir d’Allen last year, the record of five-year-olds in the Champion Hurdle is not strong. Such horses have won the race twice from 102 runners over the past 33 runnings and it remains notoriously difficult for horses of that age to break into top-level races, over any distance. This has to be an obvious concern for fans of last year’s Triumph Hurdle winner Pentland Hills, for all that this year’s race looks a weak renewal.The Weatherbys Cheltenham Festival Betting Guide 2020, written by Paul Ferguson, is published this week and available through this link for £15.95.A Cheltenham Festival stat of the day will appear here from Monday to Friday for the next three weeks.While we don’t often take a cut at Irish racing in this space, today’sPunchestown card is easily the most interesting fare of the day.

Walking down this track, strewn with roots and ruts, wouldn’t normally be too challenging. But today I’m attempting to reach the bottom at a faster pace. The trouble is, I’m struggling with my fear of falling.Thankfully, help is at hand. I’m in the Black Mountains for a Beginning Fell Running for Women course, run by Welsh company Element Active, based at Llanbedr village near Crickhowell. The day is run by Ruth Pickvance, a former international runner and British fell champion, and Faye Johnson, who competes internationally for Wales. Ruth created the course to encourage women to try fell running, which means dashing over hills and dales in wide-open spaces, rather than the usual joggers’ grind of pounding the pavements.The growth of parkrun (which has seen more than four million participants since 2004), and programmes such as Couch to 5k, have led to a surge in the popularity of running. And now many runners, especially women, are looking to push their boundaries even further – and immerse themselves in nature – by embracing sports such as fell running.Excited, nervous chatter fills the air as our group of 16 women arrive at Llanbedr village hall, our base for the day. Our ages range from mid-30s to late-60s, with reasons for signing up that include gaining off-road confidence and beating anxiety. Two things we all have in common are a love of nature and the headspace that running affords. “I have to be in the mountains to keep myself sane,” says Pi Davidson, who has travelled from the Hebridean island of Jura. “Running gives me a child-like sense of freedom,” another woman, from London, adds.I’m pleased to learn the day won’t be all heads-down running. Instead, it’s broken into three indoor and three outdoor sessions. Inside, we learn about everything from essential kit to finding suitable races. Outside, the focus is on technique and practice, rather than distance. Participants only need to be able to run 5km to join the course, and there are bite-sized sessions to ensure that everyone can work to their own level.It wasn’t so long ago that fell running was considered the preserve of men. It grew out of events such as the Guide’s Race, which started in the late 19th century and saw male mountain guides race up and down fells in the Lake District. “Women were only allowed to compete in the British Fell Running Championships from 1979, many years behind their male counterparts,” says Ruth.For Ruth, the attraction is simple. “Fell running is about moving fast and unencumbered through beautiful landscapes,” she says. “It requires minimal kit: you leave technology behind and connect with nature. You’ve got the weather and the terrain to contend with, which requires self-reliance. It’s a real adventure, in a way that running on tarmac isn’t.”Moments later, we see just what she means as we run beneath the dappled canopy of woods in the Vale of Grwyney. We do a two-mile loop twice, negotiating a loose rocky section, crossing the fast-flowing Grwyne Fechan river and pushing up an incline. Unlike with pavement pounding, I have to concentrate on my foot placement, and enjoy the liberating feeling of choosing my own route.It’s tempting to chat, but Ruth asks us to refrain on the second loop, to see if we notice the difference. Immediately, there’s a shift. I hear the river burble and I smell the earth. I see shafts of sunlight that rake the trail and feel twigs cracking underfoot. We tune into the landscape, feeling the terrain, working with it, as we run.While reaching the top of a fell requires physical fitness, running downhill involves mental fortitude – and a hefty dose of confidence. For Ruth, this is often where women come unstuck. “Women tend to be perfectionists, with an internal monologue that says we aren’t good enough. Fear of falling is natural,” she reassures us. “But taking risks is a prerequisite for confidence. We aren’t asking you to lose control, but we want you to grow in confidence.”Having two instructors means we can break into smaller groups and pick up extra tips. Like Ruth, Faye strikes just the right balance between nurturing and encouraging. “Send your arms wide for balance,” she suggests as I lollop downhill. “Leaning slightly forwards will increase your speed. Switch your brain off and let your legs take over.”We begin on an open, gently sloping field before moving on to trickier – and steeper – terrain. I’m soon picking up the pace downhill, but our final challenge is yet to come: the ascent and descent of Table Mountain (its original name is Crug Hywel), a 451-metre hill looming above us.We hike up the steep, fern-lined incline – any idea of running having long been left behind. I copy Ruth’s technique of pushing off my thighs with my hands, leaning forwards and taking deep breaths.After around 15 minutes of climbing, I reach the summit. My sense of achievement is shared by the others as they arrive with infectious smiles. We spend a few moments basking in the sunshine, drinking in panoramic views of the Brecon Beacons behind us and Sugar Loaf in front.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

This year’s contestants are one week away from the end of the first ever winter edition of the hit reality contest and two broadcasts – Saturday’s Unseen Bits and Sunday’s main show – had already been halted.While ITV are yet to confirm whether this year’s Islanders had been informed about the death of the show’s former presenter on Saturday, they released a statement on Monday saying that a tribute to Flack would air during Monday’s episode. The broadcaster also added that they and their sponsor – the food delivery company Just Eat – had worked with the Samaritans to replace the show’s idents with information on mental health support.Despite these adjustments, prior to broadcast it remained unclear exactly how ITV would handle Flack’s death while also returning to the often drama-fuelled villa. Tensions often run high and now-eliminated contestant Shaughna Phillips had already been shown under visible mental strain in the past few weeks. Even if ITV acknowledged Flack’s suicide, the fourth associated with the series, was it not a message that would be totally incompatible with the mood of their most popular reality show, which can jolt unexpectedly from flippancy to heartache?The programme began not with a montage of Flack’s ‘best bits’, as many viewers had expected. Rather, in a sombre voiceover accompanied by footage of lapping waves, Iain Stirling, the show’s narrator, declared that the Love Island team were “absolutely devastated” by Flack’s death. He went on to praise the presenter’s “passion, warmth and infectious enthusiasm”, before imploring viewers to “be kinder, always show love and listen to one another”. Far from his usual sardonic commentary, Stirling’s voice cracked as he delivered the final line of the tribute: “I’m going to miss you, Caz”.It felt somewhat strange, then, to segue from this tribute straight into the episode, with footage seemingly intended for Sunday’s show and presumably filmed on Friday (the Islanders have the day off each Saturday). However, the producers had clearly tempered the mood to fit with the circumstances a game where the Islanders’ had to answer provocative questions, among them“which couple is the laziest”, was edited into a largely frivolous section, with far more laughter and less backbiting than one might expect. Stirling, clearly grieving his colleague, did not provide his usual dry, witty asides, instead providing more of a functional audio description than a narration. Until the final scene – where couples had to choose two other pairs to send home – the entire show felt both strangely light-hearted and unusually subdued, an uncanny version of its usual self.Whether ITV had done what they chose to and air the show in an altered form, or pay tribute to Flack in a more extensive way before bringing the show back later in the week, they were bound to strike the wrong tone for some viewers. While some online found the contrast between the #bekind idents and the programme itself jarring, many praised the channel for finding a way to continue the series while also referencing the wider context of social media trolling and media harassment which contributed to its former presenter’s death.However, difficult questions abound – ones that even a good edit cannot fix. In an arguably impossible situation, ITV put together a show that tried hard to present Love Island as a force for good, and which honoured Flack’s contribution. But it was far from a true representation of the show, for better or worse, or the culture which surrounds it. If it is to have any chance at a future, then more honesty – and a larger tribute to Flack, whose presence was so key to its success – feels like the only way forward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65143a33ef56a8c5486862e989a09413ecd43a95/1086_195_2737_1642/master/2737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a624b15f811248ca34f9752089dacbe","title":"tv soap superfans coronation street hollyoaks eastenders","story":"In an age of streaming giants, soaps are holding their own. As Coronation Street and EastEnders celebrate milestones, we meet the superfans who live and breathe their shows Pete Price has watched every episode of Coronation Street, having caught the very first one back in 1960. “It was a dull, black and white street and, to this day, I don’t know why I got hooked,” says the 74-year-old Liverpudlian with a laugh. “But my whole family kept tuning in. Next thing you know, it’s a phenomenon. Now it feels like the characters live with me. I can’t imagine life without it.”Despite the massive growth of streaming services – Netflix plans to spend more than $17bn (£13bn) on new content this year – a sizable British audience still tunes in to watch soaps on network TV. Celebrating its 60th anniversary this year, and its 10,000th episode earlier this month, Coronation Street regularly tops the ratings with more than 6 million viewers per show. And EastEnders hits 35 on Wednesday, with rumours of a dead body for its 4.5 million viewers. What keeps these fans hooked?“You become so familiar with the characters,” says Price. “They are a comforting part of your life. When Jean Alexander, who played Hilda Ogden, died in 2016, I took it really badly. My friends were taking the mickey, but it was like losing a member of the family.”For Glenda Young, another lifelong Corrie fan, the show works as nostalgia, a reminder of her childhood. “I’m 55 now, but I can remember when I was a child, being curled up on the sofa between my mum and my grandma watching Corrie,” she says. “It’s been one of the few constants in my life. It’s a real comfort, a reminder of being back home if I’ve been away.”Corrie also helped to kick off her career as a writer. “When I got my first computer in 1993, the first two words I typed into the internet were ‘Coronation Street’ because I wanted to see what was out there.” She came upon a small fan forum and began to write weekly episode recaps from her home in Sunderland at the behest of viewers overseas, where episodes lagged weeks behind. She now writes recaps to a mailing list of more than 5,000 people and organises regular visits to the set in Manchester. It was on one such trip that she met the man who would become her husband.“After we had been together for 10 years,” she says, “we went on another set visit and he suddenly got down on one knee, on the famous cobbles, to propose to me. It was bizarre how things came full circle.” Even their wedding incorporated nods to the show. “Halfway through me walking down the aisle, the music changed to the Coronation Street theme tune and everyone burst out laughing. We had to have a reference to the show – because it’s absolutely changed my life. When I sit down to watch it now, it feels like more than just a programme.”It isn’t just members of older generations who are hooked on soaps. For 19-year-old Abbey Wilson and 22-year-old Kat Moran, social media keeps them glued to their favourites. “I watch EastEnders, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks but Corrie is the one I have to watch live,” Moran says. “I have to be alone and in silence so I can tweet reactions to my followers. Then I rewatch each episode so I can properly follow the story.”Hard-hitting storylines – such as the 50th anniversary tram explosion and the rape of Carla Connor – are what have kept Moran watching. “I was only 13 when that rape storyline happened,” she says. “It really educated me about the abuse that can happen to women. It changed my understanding of the world.” Moran, who lives in Southampton, finds Corrie’s consistency a vital counter to her everyday world. “Working life can be really stressful for young people and I suffer from anxiety,” she says. “So the fact that Corrie is a constant gets me through my day. It’s been a safe place for me, somewhere you know the loose ends will be tied up and questions answered, which isn’t how real life works.”Abbey Wilson believes the appeal of soaps lies in their depiction of life. “People are often surprised when I tell them I’m a soap fan,” she says. “They normally think they’re for older people – but they are the only programmes that get close to representing our towns and jobs and people. The majority of my friends come from online Corrie fan groups and they’re all young, too.”Wilson, who lives in Derbyshire, is so committed to Corrie, she once decided to put her own partying aside for a big plotline. “I had drinks planned to celebrate my 18th but a few days before, ITV announced that a character was going to get shot on Corrie that night. So I had to cancel my plans – it was too big to miss.”Nick and Claire Arkell tuned in to Hollyoaks when it began in 1995 because it was set in Chester. “We couldn’t believe it was taking place in our town,” says Nick. “We hadn’t seen anything like it before – our own accents on TV! We were hooked instantly.”So hooked that they got married on the show’s set in 2017, or at least that’s how the TV cameras made it look. “I contacted the production team to see if they would send a video saying good luck to Claire before our wedding,” Nick says. “But they got back to me asking us to come in and film a wedding with the cast.”With only days to go before their real wedding, the couple drove to the set and Nick surprised Claire by telling her they had parts in the show. “The first I knew,” says Claire, “was when we turned up and a camera crew came towards me with my maid of honour, the character Tegan, and I was told I was getting married in Hollyoaks. I was so shocked I could hardly speak. The whole day was like a dream.”For Nick, who only sporadically watches the show now, its appeal comes through Claire’s enjoyment. “She’s the superfan,” he says. “It just makes me happy seeing what joy it brings to her life every day – so much so that when we got properly married, she walked down the aisle to the Hollyoaks theme.”“And when we got back from our honeymoon,” Claire adds, “I binged three weeks of episodes in one day to catch up.”Not everyone turns to soaps for a dose of reality, though. Neighbours fan Jack Thompson first tuned in to the Australian soap for some escapism. “I’m 38 and I remember when it was just starting in Britain. It was huge. I was a shy kid living in Newcastle in the 80s, which felt very bleak in the midst of Thatcher and the mining collapse, and then this show comes along full of tanned Aussies frolicking in the sun. It was just so enticing.”Like Moran, Thompson enjoyed the consistency of the show, the continuing storylines of long-serving characters. “It’s been the one constant in my life. I had a lot of ups and downs in my late teens, moved around the country many times, so it has always been comforting to know that characters like Karl and Susan are still there. It makes me emotional talking about it.” As he talks from his home in Newcastle, his voice is cracking.This reliability, this sense that they’re here for ever, seems to be what makes these shows so appealing – particularly in the fast-paced, binge-watching streaming age, when favourite shows can often be cancelled without ever reaching a resolution, which happened recently with The OA on Netflix. Soaps just keep moving forward.“Don’t get me wrong,” says Price. “I fell out of love with Corrie a couple of times. It’s like a relationship. I’d think, ‘Why am I bothering?’ when there were ridiculous storylines. But like any relationship, you fight through and you stick with it. Now, they’re on a roll with some phenomenal storylines and I can’t see any of the soaps slowing down. They’re not just an integral part of my life but a part of British life in general.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9b1ac8ee31fa97266ff0db41f7bb5d710a02523/0_201_2712_2474/master/2712.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3215ac71ff602f9edb044c6746e31cb8 880w","title":"ghost ship mv alta washes ashore ireland year sea storm dennis","story":"Public warned away from MV Alta, which ran aground on Cork coast during Storm Dennis Abandoned by its crew, the cargo vessel made a lonely odyssey across the Atlantic, a ghost ship seemingly destined never to make port.The 77-metre MV Alta drifted for over a year, skirting the Americas, Africa and Europe, rusting and derelict yet resolutely afloat.Its voyage came to an end during Storm Dennis on Sunday when it ran aground near Ballycotton, a fishing village in County Cork, Ireland, overlooking the Celtic Sea. The Alta wedged itself on to rocks, apparently intact.On Monday experts from the local council, the Irish coastguard and Ireland’s commissioner of wrecks were discussing what to do with a visitor that was drawing lots of attention.“Cork county council is asking members of the public to stay away from the wreck location as it is situated on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and is in an unstable condition,” the council said in a statement.Environmental scientists who visited the area on Monday did not see visible pollution, the council said. It has asked a marine contractor to board the Alta – the next opportunity will be on Tuesday at around 7am, during low tide – for a closer inspection. “Any risk in relation to oil, other hazardous substances and pollution from the vessel will be evaluated.”Built in 1976, the Alta was flagged in Tanzania, changed owner in 2017 and was sailing from Greece to Haiti in September 2018 when it become disabled about 1,380 miles (2,220km) south-east of Bermuda.Unable to make repairs, the 10-strong crew was rescued by the US coastguard cutter Confidence, which brought the crew members to Puerto Rico. According to gCaptain, a maritime industry news site, the US coastguard contacted the ship’s owner to arrange a commercial tug to tow it to shore.It was reportedly towed to Guyana only to be hijacked, with its subsequent fate unclear until August 2019 when a Royal Navy ice patrol ship, HMS Protector, encountered it in the mid-Atlantic, apparently unmanned.It is thought to have later drifted up from Africa and past Spain to Ireland.In ocean lore, the story of the ghost ship the Flying Dutchman is a myth dating from the 1700s. The Mary Celeste, in contrast, was real: it was found abandoned, heading for the strait of Gibraltar in 1872, the crew’s fate a mystery.More recently, in 2006 the tanker Jian Seng was found off the coast of Queensland, Australia, without a crew, the identity of its owner and its origins unclear.In 2016 a wooden houseboat washed ashore on Ireland’s Atlantic coast. Made with driftwood and polystyrene and fitted with solar panels, it turned out to have been built by Rick Small, a Canadian environmentalist who had given the boat away and had no idea how it ended up crossing the ocean unmanned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06b102f5809dd997e053a8c3f923fd1ad264ba9/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7496032935b3a5d0e7c662052414a595","title":"greece pauses plans for new refugee detention centres on islands","story":"Athens extends talks with local officials amid opposition to plans on frontline of crisis Greece has halted plans to construct new detention centres on outlying islands facing Turkey amid mounting opposition from resident communities who fear they will become permanent.The centre-right administration announced it would extend talks with regional authorities about replacing “anarchic” open-air camps with closed facilities on the Aegean outposts.Athens hopes the new installations will help ameliorate an increasingly chaotic situation on Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Leros and Kos, where overcrowding in camps has been exacerbated in recent months by a fresh influx of refugees and migrants determined to reach Europe from Turkey. More than 42,000 people are now crammed into camps designed to accommodate 5,400.“We have asked for €260m in additional EU funding to create the new centres on the islands,” Mitarachi told the . “There will be five camps – one in Mytilene, one in Samos, one in Chios, one in Leros and one in Kos. The islands asked for emergency measures and this is an emergency measure.”Five years after the immigration crisis erupted, the latest surge in arrivals has pitted communities on the frontline against policymakers in the capital.Kostas Moutzouris, the governor of the north Aegean and the region’s most senior official, expressed optimism that the decision to pause would allow dialogue to be relaunched. “We hope this time will help the government understand reality and the wishes of the islanders,” he said, emphasising that Athens’ priority should be the “immediate and comprehensive” decongestion of the islands.Following its decision to sequester land for the proposed camps, the government has faced protests, roadblocks and threats of legal action from the island communities. On Lesbos, the gateway for close to a million displaced refugees at the height of the Syrian civil war, residents pledged to stop bulldozers beginning construction work. After an announcement that patrols would be set up to guard the land earmarked for the camp, locals bent on voicing their resistance wrote out the word oxi (no) in stones across the plot at the weekend.Not since March 2016, when the EU struck a landmark accord with Turkey to curb arrivals, have migratory flows been as high as at present. In Lesbos, close to 21,000 people are staying in Moria, a holding facility regarded as the worst refugee camp in the world.On any given day hundreds more people reach the entry points in rickety boats charted by smugglers. Under the EU-Turkey deal, asylum seekers are duty-bound to remain on the islands until their requests are completed. There is a backlog of 90,000 applications.Mayors highlighting the difficulty of life on the outposts say residents no longer have easy access to healthcare or other services because of the strain on local infrastructure. A surge in petty crime has been reported, further exasperating communities who had once shown extraordinary compassion towards refugees.Mitarachi, the migration minister, who hails from Chios, is acutely aware of the islanders’ fatigue. Echoing international aid organisations that have long pressed for a mass evacuation of refugees from the islands, he described the deteriorating situation as a humanitarian crisis.“What might not be a crisis for Europe today, or for Greece overall today, is a big issue for five islands,” he said. Asked where he would put the crisis on a scale of one to 10, he replied: “Between a seven and an eight, provided we don’t have a big jump in arrivals, which is very hard to predict.”Last year one in four would-be asylum seekers entering Europe came though the Greek isles, making them by far the busiest gateway to the continent. Bolstering border patrols, fast-tracking the asylum process and pushing for a common EU migration policy are among other policies the government has announced to tackle the problem.The new facilities will be designed to accommodate 20,000 people for a maximum of three months. Asylum seekers will be provided with permits to allow them to go out during the day but will be kept under lock and key at night. Anyone accused of violating the law as they wait for requests to be processed will be detained permanently before they are flown back to their home countries.He said one of the biggest difficulties facing Greece was its inability to process asylum seekers off the islands and on the mainland, because if they were rejected then Turkey refused to take them back.This month riot police used teargas to forcefully break up an otherwise peaceful protest by refugees on Lesbos. Days earlier the government had declared it would forge ahead with another plan, equally controversial, to create a floating barrier to deter people from attempting to get to the islands from Turkey.With locals now threatening to stop bulldozers moving in to create the new camps, the explosive mood seems set to only get worse in the run-up to spring when ever more people are expected to try to reach Europe via Greece."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6cf8239bbf07460a7d30aaa1ae64683ba133675/0_0_1667_1000/master/1667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3c48c010956c11deeae58c7a305b518","title":"librarian moria tales hope refugee camp","story":"The camp has become known for overcrowding, fires and riots. But for the people who live there, life goes on – and every day brings new stories of resilience, bravery and compassionIt is not easy to find the library at Moria on the Greek island of Lesbos. Before reaching the refugee camp’s main entrance, you turn off the road where the police bus is always parked, then walk up the track that runs beside the perimeter fence. You walk past the military post and the hawkers selling fruit and veg, trainers, cooking utensils, cigarettes, electrical equipment – pretty much everything past huge stinking mountains of bagged-up rubbish – so much rubbish and past the worst toilets in the world, overflowing with excrement and plastic.Then, opposite the hole in the fence where people who don’t want to use the main gate come and go, you turn right, into what they call the Jungle, the olive groves into which the camp has exploded, because it was meant for 3,000 people and now has 20,000. Continue along the winding path, watching out for low-slung washing lines, past the burnt-out olive tree and the tiny tent with the family who always say hello, then turn left up the steep hill that becomes a muddy slide after rain. And there it is, on the right: Moria’s new library.From the outside, it looks like all the other structures in this part of the camp – a shack cobbled together from bits of wood and tarpaulins. But inside there are shelves and books. And, standing behind a counter, wearing a New York Yankees beanie, a librarian – Zekria, from Afghanistan.He runs a school, too – that is how the library started. Zekria, 40, his wife and their five children arrived on the island a year ago in the usual perilous way, in a small boat at night across the 12-mile strait from Turkey. He tried to register the kids at one of the NGO-run schools that provide some educational activities, but they were all full the waiting list could have been a month, two months, three months.So Zekria, who used to teach law at a university in Kabul, decided to start his own class. “I bought a whiteboard and some markers. It started in an open area under an olive tree last March, teaching English,” he says. “English is the most important, because, even though people get stuck here for a year, two years, more even, no one wants to live here for ever.” He speaks excellent English, softly.More and more people – mostly Afghans, but also Syrians, Iraqis and members of other nationalities – wanted classes. Zekria was invited to people’s tents and containers to teach soon he had more potential students than he could cope with. So he set up a team and they built a classroom. Registration opened one Friday morning. “When I came here at 7.30am, more than 600 people were in the line.”They scheduled lessons for everyone: no one gets turned away, even if it means 50 to a class. “We cannot say no,” says Zekria. As if to prove it, 14-year-old Somahya shows up to register for German lessons (her family is trying to get to Germany) and is told there will be a class available by next week.Now there are three classrooms and the teaching team numbers 30, with more than 1,000 students learning English, German, French and Greek, guitar and art. In the room next to the library, a class mostly of teenagers is painting designs on T-shirts on the floor. “It’s very important for people living in this stressful place,” says Zekria. “They come here, paint or listen to music, they learn something, they’re busy, they forget the other traumatic stuff they suffer in this camp. Psychology starts in action. Doctors will advise, but we are doing it in action.”The library is the latest project. Zekria hasn’t quite worked out the system yet. It doesn’t officially open until tomorrow. He thinks it is going to be one book borrowed at a time, maybe two if users travel a long distance within the camp. They will be able to keep items for a week, maybe 10 days. So far, books have mostly been donated by aid workers and NGOs, some possibly more pertinent (Catch-22) than others (the Lonely Planet guide to China). Zekria would like more books in Farsi and Arabic. I have only one book with me, a new one by the film-maker Chris Atkins about his time banged up in Wandsworth prison in London. That could be relevant, I guess. Anyway, it is there now, in the library at Moria.Zekria’s own sentence – and his family’s – is further uncertainty. Their asylum application has been rejected. He doesn’t know why, but suspects it may have something to do with this educational activity. The authorities don’t like it, he says.I have come to Moria on the hunt for hope. It began with a letter to the  from an aid worker there. He was concerned that the notorious camp’s portrayal in the media was relentlessly negative. But working there, he said, was an amazing experience every day, he witnessed acts of kindness by extraordinary people. It gave him faith in humanity. You will have heard about the desperate conditions, the overcrowding, the fires, the riots, the unaccompanied minors, the trauma, sexual exploitation, rape and murder. I am here to see if there is another, more positive side to Moria.Bloody hell, that looks unlikely. “Moria no good,” is the chorus to my time at the camp. The same issues come up again and again: the fear and the cold at night, freezing showers, the unreliable supply of water, no electricity, queueing for hours for food, for months, years or for ever for permission to leave the island. Then there are the fights that break out among the frustrated, angry, bored young men who make up a high proportion of those living here. Just before my arrival, a 20-year-old Yemeni man was fatally stabbed, the second death this year. No one came here for this.Moria is hell, a stain on 21st-century Europe, where bureaucracy, politics and simply not caring enough have left tens of thousands in limbo – people fleeing war and danger, looking for a future for themselves and their children and not finding it. Moria’s existence is a disgrace, a failure of morality.Yet, somehow, a sort of life goes on humanity survives in hell. I am here for three days – two alone, then another with the photographer Byron Smith – and experience so much goodwill and humour.I am offered warm flatbread fresh from one of Moria’s many ovens, sunflower seeds from kids, shisha from a bunch of Iraqi lads standing around a fire. Language is sometimes a problem, but it turns out it is possible to discuss the demise of Manchester United through sign language. There are more people here from Afghanistan than from any other country and I end up talking to more Afghans than anyone else, but I also meet people from Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, South Sudan, Nigeria, Burundi, Zimbabwe and even Myanmar.There is no power to make coffee or tea in Wahid Amini’s store today, but he has cold drinks. A cameraman back in Kabul, Wahid, 20, is trying to join his family in France, but his application has been rejected. He is hopeful that, with legal help and more documentation, he might get there one day. The shop, next to a busy barber’s, is a new enterprise, to try to make a bit of money. He sells shampoo, rice, spaghetti, washing-up liquid, disposable razors, etc, which he buys outside the camp. He is open 24 hours.The Najafi family – Abdullah and Gulbdan, plus their sons Ali Reza (15), Mohammad (14) and Meraj (five) – invite us into their homemade tent. It is tiny for five people – six, actually their 16-year-old daughter, Faezh, has gone to queue for a cold shower. But it is spotless and tidy – blankets have been folded and piled up for the day – and we leave our muddy shoes at the entrance. The family’s belongings hang in rucksacks from the wall, next to the Afghan flag and a couple of soft toys, one of which looks like a Kevin the Carrot from Aldi. I really hope it is one of the Kevins I recently sneaked into the charity-shop bag at home.Gulbdan must know of a secret power source, as she conjures up an electric kettle and hot water to make tea, served in cracked cups with almonds and biscuits. Touching hospitality in any circumstance properly moving in Moria.Mohammad shows me footage on his dad’s phone of him taking part in a karate tournament in Iran. Abdullah and Gulbdan left Afghanistan 20 years ago the kids have been brought up in Iran until now. Mohammad, already a black belt, won his bout. There is no karate in Moria, just actual fighting. The Najafi family keep to their tent after dark.They show us pictures on Faezh’s camera of some of their journey. Playing on a beach in Turkey, rock pools, jellyfish. She didn’t take pictures of the crossing – it was too dark and too scary – but there is a little video of them on the beach where they landed in the north of Lesbos, looking tired but happy, in Europe at last. They never imagined they would end up like this.There is plenty of humanity on show from the aid workers. Kind Danish women distribute clothes a group of Dutch Christians hand out boxes of toys a middle-aged British man with a background in water engineering leads a team to maintain the camp’s showers, toilets and sewers. There are hundreds of mostly young volunteers, who consider Moria unacceptable and Europe’s shame. They are not indifferent: they want to make a difference. I meet many who came for a few weeks and ended up staying for a year, sometimes two.One Happy Family is, as you might expect from its name, good news. A community centre a few miles from the camp, run by various organisations along with many refugee volunteers, it has a medical centre, a playground, a gym, a women’s space, a cafe, board games, a phone-charging station and an electrical repair shop. There is also a garden, where refugee volunteers including Sima Mohammedi and Reza Rezaie show me the beetroot, spinach, turnips, chard, beans and herbs they are growing. Covering the compost heap is a big piece of black rubber, just recognisable as part of one of the dinghies that bring refugees from Turkey and then get abandoned. Recycling.The vegetables contribute to the OHF kitchen, where they cook lunch for up to 1,200 people every day. Today’s chefs are Fifie from Zimbabwe and Mohammed from Myanmar. They are cooking vegetables, lentils, chickpeas and flatbread. Once a week they do chicken – and the queues get really long.Back at Moria, it is hard not to meet Ali Shama Eddin. He must be the most famous and is certainly the tallest person here. Ali, 23, from Damascus in Syria, arrived in Moria in 2016. He was alone: his parents had already reached Germany – but that helps your case only if you are a minor. He started helping, volunteering with the Dutch organisation Movement on the Ground, and learned English from hanging out with the Europeans he worked with.It took Ali almost two years, but he got his travel documents eventually and went to Germany to join his family. “But my heart, my mind, my feelings were here, so I decided to come back,” he says. Now he works here, as the general manager for the same NGO, Movement on the Ground. He strides about the place in his bright yellow jacket, greeting everyone in several languages, trying to sort out people’s problems, finding room in a tent for a new arrival. “I understand – I’m a refugee as well,” he says.When there is a dispute between two men, one of whom says the other owes him money, Ali sits them down to try to sort it out. “I want to hear from both of you to understand how we can solve this problem,” he tells them. This one doesn’t end in a fight – for now.“There is love and communication between people from different countries – we can all be together, share a meal, discuss something. We can learn from each other, inspire each other, support each other. This is amazing,” says Ali, who is very much on board with the NGO’s ethos, which is all about treating people with dignity and respect and empowering them.Who is this European woman, who looks a bit like Johan Cruyff and smokes like him, too? Ah, Susila Cruyff, the daughter of the footballer. She is here with the Cruyff Foundation, which develops sports activities for children in need around the world. Nowhere are kids more in need than here. The foundation is going to build a football pitch – a Cruyff court – in the camp and Susila is here to look for a suitable site. At the moment, there is nowhere flat in camp to kick a ball. “My father used to think that sport is more than sport,” she says. “It’s good for your health, but also for your mental health,” she says.The foundation will build two pitches: one here, one somewhere else on the island for the locals – the hope being that it will encourage competitions and build bridges between refugees and residents. The relationship between the two has been far from easy.“They steal, they fight, they don’t respect us,” says Sofia, my taxi driver from the airport. Tourists no longer come Lesbos is now an “Islamic place”, she says.There is a one-day general strike on the island while I am here everything is shut down. Hundreds of protesters gather in the capital, Mytilini, waving Greek flags, demanding the closure of the camp and the removal of refugees from the island. “We want our islands back, we want our lives back,” is the main slogan of the protests, which are taking place on the islands of Samos and Chios at the same time.A few miles from Mytilini, in a tiny hamlet on the Gulf of Giera, a very different scene is playing out. In what used to be a restaurant, a cosy dining room with a woodburner, four Afghan teenagers are playing with a kitten. One of them puts on some music from home and they dance.They are unaccompanied minors from Moria, children lost in a world that isn’t fair, but brought here today for something a bit like a home. They are accompanied by Eleni Dimou, who works for the government, looking after boys at Moria. Some have psychological problems some self-harm, she says. It is hard enough being a teenager anywhere, but it is really hard at Moria.Some call her Mother, says Eleni, whose own children are grown up. “Because they need a mother, they need someone.”It is a really hard job, but not a thankless one. “I get a lot of love from them,” says Eleni, who is learning Farsi. “On Christmas Day, one boy gave me a pair of socks. I said: ‘Why did you do that? It costs money.’ He said: ‘Because I know in your country, on Christmas, you give presents to the people that you love.’”This place was set up by a lovely local couple, Nikos Katsouris and Katerina Koveou. They turn up later and tell me how it came about. In 2014, Nikos, then a fisherman, was driving around with a van of fish to sell when he came across a group of refugees from Syria who had just landed. They were wet, tired and hungry there was a pregnant woman and a boy of about 10, who was on his own. Shocked by what he saw, Nikos used the money he got from the fish to buy them food and gave the boy his jacket. When he got home and told Katerina, she got to work immediately, cooking for them. Then they set off to find them, with 40 homecooked meals and all the blankets and clothes they could lay their hands on.That first lot never got their dinner: they were detained by the police before Nikos and Katerina found them. But the couple found another boatload of arrivals to give it to. Ever since, they have been helping refugees, adapting to the changing needs of the situation. When Moria opened, they took sardines, bread, rice and vegetables to the camp and they fed hungry volunteers in their restaurant. Then they started to bring families from the camp to the restaurant. “We try to give back what others took from the people,” Nikos says. “They took their lives, their smiles, their humanity, their dignity. These things we have here.”It hasn’t gone down well with the authorities. They have broken petty rules, such as that you are not allowed to be a charity and a restaurant at the same time. Nikos and Katerina have been fined a total of €47,800 (£40,000). So they have given up the restaurant and are now solely an NGO, Home for All. They have refugees here every day, to eat, to learn to cook, to be at home, like the boys today. They cook and deliver food for the most vulnerable in the camp – minors and sick people.Katerina has had to accept that they can’t help everyone. “This was my problem in the beginning – I wanted to help them all. But then I realised: ‘If I do this, probably I am not going to help anyone.’ You help those you can, and if you can do more, you do.”Why do they do it? “Because we want to and because we can,” she says.I return to Moria one more time, turning off the road where the police bus sits, up the dirt track that runs parallel to the perimeter fence, right into the Jungle. I am not going to Zekria’s library this time, not yet, but to his school, to see one of his teachers.It has been more difficult for me to talk to women in the camp than to men, mostly because of culture and tradition. No problems with 19-year-old Azita Barekzai from Afghanistan, though. She is happy to chat. Her English is good she is ambitious and wise (I hope that doesn’t sound patronising). When I ask her something I have already asked, she tells me off: “I told you!” She doesn’t want her photo taken, because she has a cold, but in the end she relents. I am glad there is a picture of Azita like many of the people I meet in Moria, she is amazing.She got here seven months ago, with her parents and her three siblings. She is the oldest of the kids. The crossing was terrifying, “really dangerous. I never thought we were going to survive.”Then she was shocked by what they had come to in Moria. The usual issues – the cold, the rubbish, the fights, being too scared to leave the tent at night. It is especially horrible when it rains. “You cannot imagine how people tolerate it. Life is really difficult here.”She wants to go to Switzerland, because she heard it accepts refugees and is beautiful. She would like to be a doctor. She has her papers already she can travel, but the rest of her family hasn’t been approved. They are still waiting.In the meantime, she is teaching English to kids in Zekria’s school. “I enjoy it a lot because I can make some people smile. I just want to make them laugh. I know that if someone laughs it doesn’t mean they don’t have problems. We need hope. Everyone – especially children – needs hope. We are really hopeless sometimes because of this bad situation. Maybe learning English gives them some hope for the future. They can go somewhere else better.”It is time for the library’s opening ceremony next door. There is a small gathering someone has brought a basket of sweets and a red ribbon. Zekria says a few words, thanks the people who nailed the bits of wood together and attached the tarpaulins, and the book donors. Then, with a pair of scissors, he cuts the ribbon. Moria’s library is, he declares, officially open.A couple of weeks later, back in my nice, safe, warm office, I WhatsApp Zekria to check a couple of things. First, he tells me that the pictures I took of the opening (Byron wasn’t around at the time) were terrible. He is not wrong. Then he says his asylum application was rejected again. Fearing deportation, he and his family managed to get to mainland Greece, where they are staying in a squat. “It’s cold, there is no electricity, it is the life of refugees,” he says. “I hate the fucking politics of the world.”He has no money left and will try to find informal work, then perhaps try to cross a land border into Albania or Macedonia. The library and the school in Moria are fine, he says. The team is running them he is in touch regularly. “I have to go,” he says. “We will speak later, my friend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f787a197d6a106bca98dce89fcb34cd012680f3/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=763d4f08cdd4723698eacd04473e7c2a","title":"tuesday briefing coronavirus ship britons to be evacuated","story":"Apple expects revenue drop as iPhone production is hit … Bercow counters bullying claims … and poet calls for more northern accents in newsreadingHello, it’s Warren Murray getting the show on the road this morning.The British government has said it is working to organise a flight to evacuate citizens from the cruise ship Diamond Princess, where more than 450 people have tested positive for the Covid-19 coronavirus.

It was first suggested by Guy Verhofstadt, the ex-Belgian PM and then Brexit coordinator for the European parliament, who continues to back the idea. “The Maastricht treaty created the concept of ‘European citizenship’,” Verhofstadt said, “and I am in favour of using this now as a basis for people who want to keep their link with Europe.” The chances of it making headway in “future relationship” talks are limited, though, as it would require changes to EU law. Meanwhile, Portugal is considering offering subsidised post-Brexit healthcare to British tourists. Rita Marques, the tourism minister, said Portugal wanted to ensure cover offered by the European health insurance card (Ehic) could continue: “We are trying to minimise the disruption to British tourism.” About 2 million Britons visit Portugal every year.No plan for green schools – The new building for Hackbridge primary, in Sutton, opens next week as England’s first zero-carbon school, able to produce and conserve as much energy as it uses, and even put power back into the grid. It is the first school in England to meet the Passivhaus Plus low-energy design standard. But only a handful of the 500-plus schools being rebuilt or refurbished are installing renewable energy technology – and the Department for Education’s (DfE’s) recommended designs do not include renewables, writes Liz Lightfoot. In the West Midlands, warmth from canals could soon be used to heat hospitals and tower blocks. A consortium, led by London South Bank University and known as GreenSCIES, plans to install water source heat pumps in the canal through Sandwell near Birmingham. The group already extracts “waste heat” from the Northern line to warm homes in Islington, north London, accessing funds from a government renewables scheme.Bercow ‘no bully’ – John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker, has hit out at the “snobs and bigots” he says are behind bullying complaints against him. Speaking at a  Live event, Bercow said: “I was astonished when those allegations first surfaced on Newsnight nearly two years ago and for the best part of two years I’ve had to put up with this issue being weaponised against me.” Bercow said those concerned were “people who are very long accustomed not just to having their say but to having their way … I make no apology for the fact that I fought my corner. But the idea I was some sort of raging bull ... has no credibility at all.” Bercow has not been nominated for a peerage by the Tories despite his decade in the Speaker’s chair. He said he “did care” because the decision had been made against precedent: without the convention of former Speakers being sent to the Lords, future occupants of the role would be looking over their shoulders wondering if they had “hacked off the government”.The offending brain – Newly published research suggests people who offend throughout their life may have shown antisocial behaviour from a young age and have an abnormal brain structure. Adults with a long history of offending showed a smaller surface area in many regions of the brain, and thinner grey matter in regions linked to regulation of emotions and behaviour, according to the UCL study. However, experts warn the picture of cause and effect is far from clear: genetic and environmental factors, such as childhood deprivation, may have shaped their brains early in life, and smoking, alcohol or drug abuse could come into play later. Prof Kevin McConway, of the Open University, said that even if the brain differences were down to genetics or other early-life factors, it may be those factors themselves that were involved, not the resulting brain differences.News of the north – The Yorkshire poet Ian McMillan has questioned why there are no newsreaders with northern English accents. The north has been prominent in news bulletins all year, from the Tory demolition of Labour’s “red wall” to HS2 and flooding in the Calder valley. “The north is a ventriloquist’s dummy and the south is in control of the speaking mouth,” McMillan writes in the Radio Times. “Newsreaders from the north aren’t reading the news about themselves because, well, there aren’t any.” McMillan said that although the north was central to the news agenda, people from the area “can’t be trusted with t’autocue, tha knows”. He urged: “So, come on, people in charge: let a northern voice read the news, and not just the news about the north.”Environmental journalist Lucy Siegle has been writing about the fashion industry for 15 years.

Photograph: iStockParents should be legally prohibited from driving their children to school, a senior Dublin City Council official has told a clean air conference.The Climate Brave event drew a panel of experts to discuss how the capital might reach ambitious air quality targets by 2030, often by way of “difficult and potentially unpopular decisions”.Brendan O’Brien, head of technical services for traffic, said that if given the power “what I would do in the morning is actually make it illegal for anybody to drive their kids to school”.“It would also eliminate the reason a lot of people say they need to drive: they’re dropping their kids off. It’s not that we don’t understand that people have to do this, it’s just that in order of us sometimes to provide all the alternatives quickly enough we have to have this massive pressure.”Tax breakAddressing various areas of traffic management, Mr O’Brien also said that 30kmh residential speed zones would be complete by next month and officials “will then go back and look at the arterial routes which still have 50kms or 60kms and see what can be done about those”.He suggested a tax break for environmentally friendly delivery vehicles within the city centre, similar to the “Bike to Work” scheme.And he said something could be done to give local authorities the power to introduce low-emission traffic zones.Monday’s exchange on public behaviour and policy revolved around a pledge by the city’s four local authorities to reach World Health Organisation (WHO) targets on clean air, levels far in advance of EU legal requirements.Dublin now joins 76 cities, regions, and countries in the commitment to bring air quality to safe levels by 2030 with the allocation of extra road space to walking, cycling and public transport at the heart of its approach.Biggest offenderAnne Graham, chief executive of the National Transport Authority (NTA), said transport had the fastest rising level of green house gas emissions, with the private car the biggest offender.The NTA is due to order three trial hydrogen buses and is also investing in hybrid technology.As regards the notion of banning school runs, Ms Graham told The  that the NTA already funds programmes to encourage children to walk or use bikes but that they often travel significant distances.“Maybe parents should think about trying to ensure that their children go to school locally . . . and then it’s more accessible by walking and cycling,” she said.Air pollution is currently linked to 7 per cent of lung cancer deaths, 18 per cent of fatal pulmonary disease cases and 34 per cent of heart disease deaths.Dr Maria Neira, director of the WHO department of environment, climate change and health, told the conference 7 million people die every year.She said 90 per cent of the world’s population are breathing sub-quality air.

Photograph:  Franck RobichonEPAIrish passengers trapped on a cruise ship off Yokohama in Japan for the past fortnight because of the coronavirus are expected to be evacuated after the Department of Foreign Affairs said it was examining proposals for them.The United States on Sunday began taking its citizens off the Diamond Princess. Canada, Italy, South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong were also making plans for their citizens among the 3,700 passengers and crew.In response to queries about the possible evacuation of at least two Irish passengers, a department spokeswoman said: “We are working with other like-minded countries.”She added the Irish passengers, believed to be a couple from Co Meath, were receiving consular assistance. They were expected to face another two-week quarantine period once off the ship.The Japanese authorities had said the results of tests for the virus performed on everyone on board would be available by Friday, when staggered disembarkations could begin. However, the US authorities had begun to take about 400 of its citizens off the ship on Sunday.Some 355 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed among the ship’s passengers, including 70 on Sunday. All of the ill have been brought ashore to hospitals.About 420 cases of the virus have been officially recorded in Japan, including one fatality - making it host to the worst outbreak outside China. Japan’s government admits it is increasingly struggling to keep track of new infections. Five people, including a doctor and his wife, have come down with the virus at a hospital in Wakayama Prefecture, hundreds of kilometres from Yokohama. The government has revealed a cluster of eight new cases in Tokyo, most apparently infected by the same taxi driver.“Japan seems to have entered a new phase where the infection route of several new cases is unclear,” health minister Katsunobu Kato warned on Monday. The US was the first country to remove its citizens from the stricken liner. On Monday morning, about 340 Americans were flown by chartered flight to California and Texas, where they will be quarantined for two weeks at military bases. A total of 40 Americans have reportedly been infected on the ship. Some have been transferred to hospitals in Japan but 14 who have the virus but no symptoms were controversially allowed to fly home in what the US Department of State called a “specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft”.Matthew Smith, an American passenger who decided to stay on the Diamond Princess tweeted on Monday: “OMG: US Gov’t said they would not put anyone on planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus. Decision not to be evacuated  best decision ever.”The remaining passengers, most of whom are aged 60 or older, are scheduled to be released from quarantine in stages from Wednesday.Experts fear the Covid-19 crisis could begin to overwhelm Japanese medical facilities if it spreads. One hospital in the western suburbs of metropolitan Tokyo was forced to stop treating outpatients on Monday after a nurse fell ill. The nurse had been treating an elderly woman who died last week. The Japanese government is taking increasingly severe measures to keep the disease at bay. On Monday it cancelled public celebrations for the birthday of Emperor Naruhito later this week. Tokyo’s Marathon, which is scheduled for March 1st and expected to draw 38,000 runners, has also been curtailed.

The prices are to take effect from the middle of next month, and existing stamps will remain valid following the increase. It is the first time An Post has raised the price of a domestic stamp in three years, the last increase coming in April 2017. In a statement the company said the price increases are in line with other European postal services, and reflect the “steady decline” in the number of people posting letters. An Post said over the last three years it had invested in services to extend collection and delivery times, and to introduce digital options such as its Click and Post service, which allows customers to buy and print postage labels online. The company said it was also developing a new fully-automated sorting facility for smaller parcels in its Dublin mail centre in Clondalkin, which is expected to process 70,000 items a day when operational."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4176639.1582007710!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"marine surveyors to inspect ghost ship in cork today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta  washed up on the Cork coast during Storm Dennis over the weekend. Photograph: Irish Coast GuardPA WireA physical inspection of the MV Alto “ghost ship”, which ran aground near Ballycotton in east Cork on Sunday, is expected to be carried out by contractors for Cork County Council on Tuesday.Marine surveyors are expected to board the vessel subject to an initial health and safety assessment at low tide.The move follows an external examination of the wreck of the 77-metre cargo ship on Monday which found no visible pollution within the Ballycotton Bay Special Protection Area or near the proposed natural heritage areas.However, the environmental group Coastwatch has called for “international help” to deal with the wreck, given the “immense bioersity value” of large areas which are designated as Natura 2000 sites, “many of international importance for seabirds”.Karin Dubsky, director of Coastwatch, said volunteers were not comforted by a statement from Cork County Council to the effect that the wreck does not currently pose a risk to the special area of conservation within the BallymacodaBallycotton area.“Comfort would have been confirmation that expert oil removal support was on its way,” she said.JourneyThe MV Alta’s journey appears to have begun in the mid-Atlantic in 2018, when the crew of 10 requested assistance, explaining the ship had been disabled since September 19th. It had been en route from Greece to Haiti.The crew of the Tanzanian-registered cargo ship said they had been unable to make repairs and reported they had just two days of food and 15 days of water left.The ship was then 1,500 nautical miles west of the African coast and 1,000 nautical miles east of the Caribbean.The US authorities first sent a HC-130 Hercules airplane from Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which dropped a week’s supply of food aboard the stricken vessel. The coast guard followed this up by sending the US Coastguard Cutter Confidence, then on patrol near Puerto Rico, some 1,300 nautical miles distant.The Confidence arrived on October 7th and found the MV Alta about 1,380 nautical miles southeast of Bermuda. At the time of the rescue the maritime publication Captain reported the US Coast Guard’s Fifth District Command Centre was working with the ship’s owner to arrange a commercial tow for the MV Alta.The next time the MV Alta was sighted was almost a year later when the Royal Navy ice patrol ship HMS Protector announced: “We closed the vessel to make contact and offer our assistance but no one replied. Whilst investigations continue we’re unable to give you more detail on this strange event.” The exact position of the sighting was not released.According to the writer Mikhail Voytenko, of Maritime Bulletin, the MV Alta may have been towed to Guyana before being hijacked and abandoned a second time.Mr Voytenko said in July 2019 he had been contacted by people claiming to be the owners of the MV Alta who alleged the ship was towed to Guyana, before being hijacked from there, and later abandoned a second time. The writer and blogger said, “I don’t know what to make of this story.”The US Coast Guard’s Fifth District was asked for a comment on what, if anything, it knew of the fate of the ship after the rescue of the crew, and a response is anticipated.The wreck is now the property of the Minister for the Marine under the Salvage and Wreck Act 1993."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4176728.1581975804!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i won t be behind the door when it comes to telling people my ability","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThen Senator Frank Feighan (left) and Richard Bruton TD attend a British Irish Parliamentary Assembly  meeting in Wicklow last year. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Eight or nine years ago he felt his political career was over. But on Thursday Frankie Feighan will return to the Dáil having successfully won a seat for Fine Gael in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency. There was the widespread public ire over his support of the Government to withdraw Accident and Emergency services at Roscommon County Hospital in 2011 and as a result he didn’t stand in the 2016 general election. But he has no regrets over his stance on the hospital back then, though he expected, then and now, that he should have received greater support from colleagues at the time.“There would be a hundred people dead today under the old arrangements for the A\u0026ampE, where you’d go to Roscommon to be stabilised, sent to Galway and patients would die on the road. The hospital is twice as busy as ever before. “I felt let down that I put my personal and political good name out there. Yet some Ministers didn’t give two continentals at the time. I suppose that’s politics. But I did expect a little bit of, not empathy, but more support.” Feighan’s success in the most recent election was one of the few good news stories in the general election campaign for Fine Gael. In time, he hopes it will leave him in line for promotion.“Before, there were different reasons why I wasn’t considered for a Ministry, geographical for one. But now, I feel that I won’t be behind the door when it comes to telling people my ability or my seniority.”Good Friday Implementation bodyHe mentions his roles as chairman of the Good Friday Implementation body and being a member of the British-Irish parliamentary body: “I’ve always tried to do what’s right. I’m not afraid to make difficult decisions.”For all that, he believes Fine Gael will be in opposition unless the “political stars” align. Indeed, Feighan believes a term in opposition is needed to regroup after nine years in Government.“It’s hard to pinpoint why there were the results of the other day. I think there’s a ‘transient constituency of voters’ out there – in 2011, it was Fine Gael and Labour, last year it was the Green Party, this time it is Sinn Féin.“There are two worlds out there – a Facebook world and a real world. I was very encouraged visiting houses and businesses,” he goes on, “Most people were measured and respectful.“Then you look at Facebook and you kind of think that there was every type of lunatic waiting around the corner,” declared Feighan, who returns as a TD on Thursday after a four-year absence.The Roscommon A\u0026ampE battles have left scars: “I used to be very sociable. I haven’t had a drink outside Boyle town since 2011. I went to Castlerea one night and someone tried to assault me,” he says. ‘Refused to shake hands’“At funerals people refused to shake hands with me. I also turned off – I closed down myself. I was angry and hurt but thankfully, it’s toughened me up,” he declares. But he would still do the same thing. if asked again today.“Locally, politics is such that once you become toxic, people don’t really want to know you,” he says, “ I remember going to a local book launch and was in a corner of the room and no-one, I mean no-one, came over to me.”The crash left its mark on many, including himself: “I was one of those people. Recession brings a lot of other complications – personal and financial. I accept there are a lot of people out there still very hurt and angry.”But Sinn Féin has made “auction politics” pledges that cannot be fulfilled. Referring to Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane’s “up the ’Ra” remark, he says, “We won’t unite our country with actions such as that.”Looking back on his party’s election campaign, Feighan believes the handling of commemorating the RIC as part of the decade of centenaries programme affected his party’s election campaign from the off.Feighan wears the poppy, proudly, believing that the role of all Irish should be commemorated. But, it was a mistake to commemorate the RIC before the election, he says simply.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil should try to form a government with each other and that Fine Gael is prepared to go into opposition.Speaking after a six-hour meeting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, Mr Varadkar did not rule out Fine Gael entering government with Fianna Fáil, but added: “I don’t foresee that happening.” “The future is about leading the party into opposition,” Mr Varadkar said after the meeting in Leinster House. Mr Varadkar has no mandate from his parliamentary party to enter government negotiations, but said he can meet with other parties to share views and analysis on the election, beginning with the Social Democrats on Tuesday.According to those present at the meeting, the overwhelming view was that Fine Gael should go into opposition, while keeping participation in government – aside from an arrangement with Sinn Féin – open as a last resort. Those who spoke against the idea of a coalition with Fianna Fáil included Minister for Rural Affairs Michael Ring and Dublin South West TD Colm Brophy, while Minister for Communications Richard Bruton is said to have suggested the possibility of the main parties entering a Danish-style minority government arrangement. Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan kept open the prospect of government with Fianna Fáil, if it was needed in the national interest. Vote for TaoiseachMinister for Agriculture Michael Creed questioned if Mr Varadkar should put his name forward in the vote for Taoiseach when the 33rd Dáil meets on Thursday. Mr Varadkar said he will do so. It is understood that Green Party leader Eamon Ryan will also put his name before the Dáil. A number of left-wing TDs said they are considering supporting the candidacy of Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald.On Monday, Ms McDonald said it was still possible for her party to lead a minority government of the left without the involvement of Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.Her comments reflect a change of emphasis following remarks by her colleague Eoin Ó Broin on Friday that it would be impossible. “All options are still on the table but we’re all able to count,” Ms McDonald said, “we’re able to add, and we’re able to subtract so I think we have recognised that the mathematics are tricky.” Fianna Fáil has 38 seats, with Sinn Féin on 37 and Fine Gael on 35.Other Fine Gael TDs who raised concerns at Monday night’s meeting about coalition with Fianna Fáil were John Paul Phelan and Peter Burke. Both are understood to have questioned why Fine Gael would say it is both preparing for opposition while leaving open the option of entering government. Minister for Health Simon Harris also said government participation should be kept on the table, although some present noted that Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe did not express a view.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: EPAMainland China reported 1,886 new cases and 98 more deaths for a total of 1,868 in its coronavirus update on Tuesday as officials said more than 80 per cent of cases had been mild.The latest figures came after Chinese health officials published the first details on nearly 45,000 cases of infection with the coronavirus that originated there, saying not only had the majority of cases been mild but new ones seemed to be falling since early this month.The death toll was down slightly from the 105 fatalities in the 24 hours to Monday morning,The report on the 45,000 cases by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention prompted guarded optimism from health authorities.A total of 72,436 cases had been reported in mainland China as of Tuesday, although a spike in recent cases was due to a broader definition in the hardest-hit region based on doctors’ diagnoses before laboratory tests were completed.Monday’s report gives the World Health Organisation a “clearer picture of the outbreak, how it’s developing and where it’s headed”, WHO’s director-general told a news conference.“It’s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.Annual congressChina may postpone its annual congress in March, its biggest political meeting of the year, to avoid travel while the disease is still spreading. Communist Party officials will meet on February 24th to deliberate on a postponement of the meeting due to start on March 5th.The country’s biannual auto show, one of the industry’s biggest international events, has been postponed, and many sports and entertainment events have been delayed or cancelled to avoid travel that may spread the virus.Shares slipped in Asia on Tuesday as the impact from the outbreak deepened, with news of China’s possible postponement of major events coming alongside the Apple company saying it would fail to meet its profit target since the virus has affected iPhone production.Apple warned investors it would not meet its second-quarter financial guidance.The California-based company said all of its iPhone manufacturing facilities were outside Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, and all had been reopened. But the company said production was ramping up slowly.The new disease, called Covid-19, first emerged in December in Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province, and has spread to more than two dozen other countries.The new study reports on 44,672 cases confirmed in China as of February 11th. The virus caused severe symptoms such as pneumonia in 14 per cent of them and critical illness in 5 per cent.The fatality rate for these confirmed cases was 2.3 per cent - 2.8 per cent for males and 1.7 per cent for females.Those rates are lower than for Sars and Mers, which are caused by two similar viruses, but Covid-19 ultimately could prove more deadly if it spreads to far more people than the other two diseases. Ordinary influenza has a fatality rate of 0.1 per cent yet kills hundreds of thousands because it infects millions each year.The Covid-19 cases include relatively few children, and the risk of death rises with age.Health problemsThat risk is higher among those with other health problems — more than 10 per cent for those with heart disease, for example, and higher among those in Hubei province versus elsewhere in China.Cases seem to have been declining since February 1st, but that could change as people return to work and school after the Chinese holidays, the report warns.Beijing has sought to forestall that by extending the Lunar New Year holiday, imposing tight travel restrictions and demanding 14 days of self-quarantine for anyone returning from outside their immediate region.Hundreds of cases have been confirmed outside China, with a significant number on a cruise ship quarantined at a port near Tokyo.Japanese officials on Monday confirmed 99 more people were infected on the Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 454. The Health Ministry said it has now tested 1,723 people on the ship, which had some 3,700 passengers and crew aboard. Outside China, the ship has the largest number of cases of Covid-19.Japan has 518 confirmed cases, including the 454 from the cruise ship, and has recorded one death from the virus.The US evacuated 328 American passengers, with most of them now in a 14-day quarantine at military bases in California and Texas.

It\u0027s ruined. Everything. I\u0027ve lost everything.At the time I just grabbed every towel, blanket I could find and pushed them up against the front door. We\u0027d already got sandbags there because sometimes the front floods a small amount with the drains.But as we were blocking up the front door, it was all pouring through the back door as well and there was nothing we could do.In nearby Taff’s Well, a village hall was filled with donations from dozens of people including clothing and toiletries to pots and pans and food.Mike Phillips, 69, one of the committee members of the village hall, described the support as phenomenal.We\u0027ve got plenty of bedding, toys, food, clothes, cleaning items, pots, pans and crockery, he said.The people who have lost everything will be able to take whatever is here.You sometimes wonder if there is a community in the village but you get something like this and the response is phenomenal.”In Shrewsbury, the River Severn finally burst its banks in the mid-afternoon. One man desperately tried to reach his 17 year old stepdaughter stuck in one of the homes off off Chester Street and Smithfield Road, which was now sitting in metres of flood water. The man, who did not want to comment, was told by officers that if he crossed the police cordon and waded into the water he would be arrested. Cars and vans were submerged by the rising water while a crowd gathered calling to another man who continued out into the water, which rose to his midriff, in the faint hope of retrieving his vehicle.Businessman Harry Jacobs, 44, told the : “I was born here and moved away but in the fifteen years since I’ve been back I’ve never seen it like this.”Meanwhile youth climate strikers said they had to cancel their first ever national conference, with delegates coming from across the UK, due to serious flooding in Staffordshire.Sophia Coningham, 15, from London, said there was a bleak irony in their efforts to highlight climate change being hindered by the dramatic weather.The Prime Minister resisted calls to chair a meeting of the Government\u0027s emergency committee, Cobra, to tackle the flooding crisis, despite criticism from the Labour Party.Luke Pollard, shadow environment secretary, said it was a disgrace that Boris Johnson had refused to visit affected communities.Asked why Mr Johnson was not making personal visits, a Number 10 spokesman said he was receiving regular updates and that Environment Secretary George Eustice was leading on the issue.Mr Eustice defended the Government\u0027s response, saying it was not possible to protect every house from flooding and pointed to £4 billion of funding committed to flood defences in the next five years.Local authorities hit by flooding will be able to recoup some of their costs via emergency financial assistance available through the Bellwin Scheme, the Government said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk must have strategy stormy weather ahead","story":"Climate change is making our storms more extreme, and we are not adequately prepared for what is coming our way.  The government cannot pretend to be unaware of the scale of the problem ahead, having faced repeated warnings. Lord Deben, the chair of the chief advisory body on climate change, last year compared the ramshackle approach to government run like “Dad’s Army.” Although pinning specific events on climate change is an inexact science, there is a consensus that storms like Ciara and Dennis are made worse by warming temperatures that lead to a rise in rainfall. Some 5.2 million people are already at risk of flooding, with the number projected to double if warming continues at its current trajectory. A new draft strategy from the Environment Agency sets out an ambitious, wide-ranging response to the problem.The plan moves away from a strategy of temporary flood barriers, which will only be required to keep rising with water levels, to embrace a holistic approach that includes nature-based solutions. These shouldn\u0027t be overlooked - on a farm in Cambridge on Monday, third-generation farmer Martin Lines, told me how improving his soil had stopped 60 per cent of the flood damage he would otherwise have seen to his fields.But questions remain whether the EA is best placed to tackle the looming crisis with the speed it requires.The agency, which has oversight on flood prevention strategy, has been stretched by staff and funding cuts in recent years. It meanwhile has to contend with competing priorities including air and water pollution and a growing fly-tipping problem.It has faced criticism in recent years that its strategy of prioritising defences for high-risk buildings has led to perverse incentives to build in exactly those areas. According to its own calculations the number of properties built on flood plains is likely to nearly double in the next 45 years. Dieter Helm, a government adviser and Oxford professor, has called for the EA to have its responsibility for flooding taken away, and given to a dedicated flood defence body. “However good, it is just too much to ask any management to efficiently oversee floods, and to try at the same time to combine this with other very different functions,” he said yesterday. Another argument might be for the establishment of a dedicated climate change adaptation body that could take a holistic approach to the range of risks the country will face in coming years, including heatwaves and coastal erosion. Ignoring the problem will not make it go away. A recent study put the cost of climate change to the UK at £16 billion by 2050, mostly from flooding and coastal erosion. The UK has been a global leader in setting ambitious targets to tackle climate change. But when it comes to adapting to its effects, it is still struggling to catch up. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/16/TELEMMGLPICT000224717140_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc must saved imperial folly","story":"Storms are coming for the BBCSome Conservative MPs, as well as Labour ones, are getting worried that the Government is picking a fight with the BBC. Writing for the  yesterday, Huw Merriman, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on the BBC, warned of “an unedifying vendetta against this much-loved organisation” by “senior government aides”. Mr Merriman and co are right about tone, I suspect, but wrong in the content of their argument. They are right that the Government should not trash the BBC. They are wrong to conclude that the corporation can carry on as before. It is essential to understand that technological and generational change has already destroyed the BBC’s century-old “wider still and wider” doctrine. It is simply not possible for it to dominate all fields any longer. The BBC must start to decolonise. It needs government help to do this in a dignified manner – more like British imperial decline than like the fall of the Soviet Union. Any declining organisation needs to develop its strengths and jettison its weaknesses. Here are some of the strengths: global reputation a service to all regions and nations within the kingdom Radio 3 Radio 4 depth of research. Here are some weaknesses: entertainment channels, including Radio 1 and Radio 2, which could be better done commercially a website which crushes competition a massive, talent-destroying bureaucracy and, yes, bias. This bias is not chiefly party political (though it is certainly anti-Tory). It is politicocultural – woke, pro-Remain, credulously green, anti-market, obsessed with issues connected with “ersity”, yet itself not truly erse at all. This means that the BBC excludes a vast range of people, views and activities which are important in the life of this country. If you had watched only the BBC in 2016, it would have come as an almost total shock to you when 17.4 million people voted Leave. The bias led to blindness. This means that it is not a good public service. I have studied the way this bias operates for a long time, and I am convinced that it will never reduce until the BBC’s monopoly disappears.The greatest single wrong on which the BBC rests is the licence fee. It is an offence to freedom and a poll tax for anyone with a television (and, nowadays, a computer or mobile phone). Non-payers, almost always poor, clog the magistrates’ courts. They are pursued by TV Licensing, a ruthless organisation which implies untruthfully that it can enter their homes. Technology nowadays means that evasion can easily succeed, so the courts catch only the weak. Means of payment involving choice have to be found. In the short term, a much lower licence fee would help. Petroc Trelawny, the Radio 3 presenter, complains that Boris Johnson has “no more right than any licence-fee payer” to dictate the future of the BBC. His remark exposes BBC arrogance. The corporation exists under a charter provided by government, and is allowed to earn nearly £4 billion a year from the licence fee because of this. Any prime minister has not only a right, but a duty to make sure that this immense privilege is not abused. Inside the BBC’s enormous out-workings of imperial flummery lies some basic good – people who are interested in accuracy, moderation, balance, high culture, free speech, British traditions. “Out there” sit many viewers and listeners who care about these qualities too and want to rescue them. The politico-cultural task of this Government in the years before the charter runs out in 2027 is to see what can be salvaged from the wreckage caused by the BBC’s own imperial folly. Sedwill, in his shirtsleeves, sitting next to the Prime Minister at a Cabinet meeting last weekIn the recent photographs of Boris Johnson’s new Cabinet, only one man (so far as one could see) was in shirtsleeves. This was the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill. All the rest were fully suited.  I wonder why Sir Mark affects this style. It has become old-fashioned – dating, I think, from the Tony Blair era, when shirtsleeves were seen as a rejection of Tory stuffiness. On one laughably staged occasion, Mr Blair even appeared thus dressed outside in Downing Street, clutching a mug of tea with pictures of his family on it. In those days, young Mark Sedwill was, among other things, private secretary to the foreign secretary. As an ambitious young official, he may have thought that dressing down would raise him up. Perhaps it did. In fact, informality is usually inappropriate for the public face of government. Cabinet ministers have serious business to transact on behalf of us all. They should dress as if they know that. Dressing down is supposed to convey accessibility, but actually – like men putting their feet on the desk (a fault I must myself confess to) – it looks as if you think you own the place.In 2017, when he was our new national security adviser, Sir Mark shared a platform in Washington DC with his US opposite number Lt-Gen HR McMaster. This was the first time such a joint public appearance between two NSC advisers had ever happened. Americans in the audience afterwards remarked unfavourably on the contrast between the formally attired general and the shirt-sleeved Brit. The former looked up to the task, the latter like a pipsqueak. Sir Mark is no pipsqueak, but he needs to look right. Even the notoriously scruffy Boris Johnson, who is next to Sir Mark in the Cabinet picture, has managed to get his suit on. Coronavirus latest news: Briton David Abel trapped on stranded cruise liner tests positive for diseaseTuesday morning news briefing: Brexit \u0026#39can benefit all of Europe\u0026#39Comment: Defeatist officials need to stop hiding behind climate change and take action on floodsBabies born via IVF are 45 per cent more likely than those conceived naturally to die in their first year   Climate change protesters dig up Trinity College lawn at CambridgeCoronavirus latest news: Britons stuck on quarantined ship could be flown home\u0026#39Genetic afterlife\u0026#39 could see intimate DNA details revealed after deathBabies kept from mothers\u0026#39 touch in earliest weeks have disadvantages in later life, study findsPersistent lying, stealing and bullying linked to having a smaller brain, researchers findThis Country, series 3 episode 1 review: a bittersweet return for the delightful sitcomBrexit can benefit all of Europe, PM\u0026#39s chief negotiator saysCaroline Flack: Door was open for Love Island presenter to return, says ITVConfronting Holocaust Denial with David Baddiel, review: a chilling account of the dangers of the growing phenomenonThe UK must have a strategy for stormy weather aheadDeed poll process needs \u0026#39attention\u0026#39 to ensure trans people are not being outed, says High Court judgeMore havoc is forecast for regions deluged by Storm Dennis as River Severn bursts its banksComment: The EU is fatally complacent about the crisis that is about to engulf itOliver Cromwell letter in which he talks about his depression put on display for the first timeForget presenteeism, \u0026#39leavism\u0026#39 is the new bane of workers\u0026#39 lives, study findsVaping devices are prone to explode if wrong charger or battery is used, warns government bodyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/16/TELEMMGLPICT000224974142_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"defeatist officials need stop hiding behind climate change take","story":"\u0026#39Taxpayers rightly take an old-fashioned view of the responsibility of government to deal with whatever the weather throws at them and keep them safe\u0026#39Floods are toxic for politicians. David Cameron once told me that he had sacked Owen Paterson as Defra secretary partly because he had “had a bad flood” (which was somewhat ironic given Paterson’s success in dredging Somerset). Theresa Villiers left the office last week with the words: “What the Prime Minister giveth, the Prime Minister taketh away…” We don’t know whether her flood performance contributed to the loss of her job but her successor, George Eustice, will no doubt be acutely aware of the precedents.Remarkably, for someone with a background in PR, his response to the tragedy in which so far at least four people have been killed has been shockingly insensitive. “You can never be happy when you see properties flooded it’s a tragedy for them. But are we happy with the way our flood assets have operated? I would say yes,” he told LBC. He also blamed the “nature of climate change” for the scale of damage. The chief executive of the Environment Agency, Sir James Bevan, went further and blamed “the climate emergency”.They should both have a care, particularly in shrugging blame on to the climate. Taxpayers rightly take an old-fashioned view of the responsibility of government to deal with whatever the weather throws at them and keep them safe. Philip Davies, the Tory MP for Shipley, seems more in tune with his constituents’ concerns he said “precious little” has been done since the 2015 floods, and called on the Government to “pull its finger out”.Eustice and Bevan are also on shaky ground when they say that floods are becoming more extreme. “The Welland \u0026amp Deepings Internal Drainage Board in Lincolnshire have been keeping rainfall records since 1829,” says local farmer Nicholas Watts, “and when I look back on the rainfall over the past 190 years we are getting less extreme events than we used to. The worst year was 1880.” This tallies with the conclusions of a number of other farmers around the country who keep rain gauges. They know a thing or two about drainage in the Fens, where mercifully there are still some local drainage boards managing catchment areas successfully. Every year the watercourses they are responsible for are cleared and every 10 to 15 years the mud is taken from the bed, ensuring that the drain will convey the water it was designed to. In stark contrast the Rivers Welland and Witham are controlled by the Environment Agency and do flood.These are the first floods since Brexit and ministers can no longer blame EU regulations. Boris Johnson, with his emphasis on delivery, might be tempted to sack Eustice pour encourager les autres but this would be a mistake, not least because he is the first Defra secretary since Paterson with an understanding of farming. Eustice does, though, need to get a grip. The greater problem lies in the Environment Agency. Officials there are simply incapable of understanding that, like it or not, most of our watercourses are now in some way artificial and need human action. Their refusal to countenance dredging has resulted in millions of small mammals, insects and invertebrates being drowned, with a consequent impact on birdlife.Bevan, a former Foreign Office wallah, is completely unqualified to oversee rivers. He should go, and the responsibility for river management be removed from his agency and given back to local boards. The saving on pen pushers should pay for more sandbags and dredger hours. Meanwhile, flooding should be treated as a civil defence issue and overseen by a government department, preferably under the command of a Royal Engineers general. When it comes to preventing future floods, we also have to focus on our soils. Part of the problem is three generations of reliance on petrochemical fertilisers. We need to go back to using more muck, which increases organic matter and helps our fields to act like giant sponges. There should be a ban on burning straw in power stations and it should be used to feed our soils instead. In the meantime, some contrition from those in charge would be in order.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

2050 advertising","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.BP’s aim of achieving net zero emissions has rightly been criticised for lacking substance, but its commitment to stop misleading adverts about its impact on the climate is a welcome start – it must be held to account on this, writes Ben ChapmanBuried a couple of thousand words beneath BP’s eye-catching announcement that it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 was an important promise that garnered much less attention.The oil company said it would stop funding “corporate reputation advertising” which, in the context of the oil and gas industry, is more commonly known as greenwash.This means BP will end its multimillion-pound “Possibilities Everywhere” campaign, which touted the company’s questionable green credentials. That’s a fairly rapid u-turn, given that the global campaign was only launched last year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesPerhaps BP has realised the futility of spending large sums highlighting the tiny part of its business that generates renewable energy when the company remains synonymous with fossil fuels.\u0026nbspAdverts on billboards, newspapers and television in the UK, US and Europe as well as on social media and online\u0026nbsppictured\u0026nbspgreen fields and windmills alongside phrases like, “working to make energy cleaner”. The ads missed out the fact that\u0026nbsp96 per cent of BP’s capital expenditure is on oil and gas.Thanks in part to the efforts of groups like environmental lawyers ClientEarth which launched a complaint against over the campaign, the company has been held to account.Two decades – and billions of barrels of oil – since BP had the chutzpah to relaunch itself as “beyond petroleum”, people have seen through the facade.“In future, any corporate advertising will be to push for progressive climate policy communicate our net zero ambition invite ideas or build collaboration,” BP said.This statement, unlike the target to go carbon neutral by 2050, can be scrutinised immediately and it will be. I will be closely watching BP’s public statements on climate change this year, as well as its advertising and involvement with groups like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to check that they measure up.We can all play a part in this too. Earlier this month Ryanair was banned from claiming that it was Europe’s “lowest CO2 emissions airline”. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the statement couldn’t be backed up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BP sets target to achieve net zero by 2050 to tackle climate emergencyThe climate crisis is real, but Boris Johnson still ‘doesn’t get it’Boris Johnson forces out UK president of climate change summitAnyone can make a complaint to the ASA about an issue like an misleading environmental claim, it just requires filling out a few boxes on an online form.If this action does not stop airlines and oil companies producing dodgy ads on climate change, sterner laws must be enforced. ClientEarth’s suggestion that fossil fuel adverts should be banned unless they have a tobacco-style health warning need to be\u0026nbspconsidered.A fossil fuel company portraying itself as good for the climate is no less ridiculous, or dangerous, than the tobacco companies that in the 1950s pushed cigarettes with recommendations from friendly-looking doctors.Companies that create misleading adverts about climate change need to face the prospect of fines, not just damage to their\u0026nbspreputation. Currently the ASA, is self-funded by advertisers themselves and can only ban particular promotions, often months after they’ve\u0026nbspgone out.While advertising is an important way that large greenhouse gas emitters can use their financial clout to shift the debate in their favour, a more significant front on the climate change\u0026nbspinformation war\u0026nbspis political lobbying.Here too, BP has laid down a marker by which it can be judged not in 10 years or 20 years, but almost immediately.\u0026nbspThe company laid out a less aggressive approach to lobbying, stating that it would “set new expectations” for its relationships with oil industry trade associations. Where those influential groups are pushing for policies that don’t align with BP’s new approach, it will leave.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Basically, this is an admission that BP’s net-zero ambition simply has no credibility if the company remains a member of powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute which has for decades funded climate change denial in a successful effort to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. BP either has to fundamentally change the API or leave it.The impact of a big oil industry player changing tack could be considerable but action needs to follow words. I’ll also be scrutinising other large oil industry firms about whether they will follow BP in “advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing”.Fossil fuel lobbyists have vast budgets that allow\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspto shift public policy and discussion significantly towards the industry’s own interests over and above those of everyone else.In any case, oil companies\u0026nbsplike formerly state-owned BP have frequently been pushing on open doors in the corridors of power. Seen by\u0026nbsppoliticians\u0026nbspto be of strategic national importance, oil majors have provided\u0026nbspthe vital commodity that fuels economic growth and\u0026nbspdelivers votes.It’s fair to say the oil majors have frequently enjoyed a cosy relationship with governments sympathetic to their aims.\u0026nbspVast budgets to fund misinformation and dodgy science have been key to prolonging the life of fossil fuel industry decades after oil companies knew climate change was dangerous and man-made.\u0026nbspClimate campaigners, who have enjoyed less privileged access to political decision-makers, have therefore been fighting a hugely asymmetric battle but one which they may now finally be starting to win.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This challenge is already testing my limits but I have also found myself on an educational path.Six weeks in,\u0026nbspI have to admit that I do not have a clean shopping slate. I bought socks and thermals — but in my defence, the former were for my husband and the latter for my sister. I am not sure if they were trolling me but both (not being a party to my pledge) in particular asked me to buy these items for them.Okay, I also bought myself a vintage shirt, non-plastic food covers to replace cling film with and cotton face pads to cleanse the face without the need for additional products.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m changing my spending habits to help save the planetApart from the vintage shirt these latter purchases are also part of my new outlook on the things I consume: considering materials used in production the use they have and what happens once they become waste.From trying my best to avoid buying lunch wrapped in plastic to opting for plastic free cosmetics, I am trying to progressively reduce my waste.My phone is 20 months old and previously that would mean I would be ready to buy the new shiny phone with the improved camera. Instead I opted to renew my sim-only contract and stick with the handset I have as it’s functioning perfectly well.\u0026nbspAt the weekend I chose to replace the broken pipe for my 12-year-old vacuum cleaner rather than buy a whole new machine. I never knew that Dyson sells parts for even their older models, which came in very handy.Overall, I am changing my approach to things I own and may or may not need to buy, which is reducing my eco anxiety and saving me money.Created with Sketch.Plastic waste across the world: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A father and son on a makeshift boat made from styrofoam paddle through a garbage filled river as they collect plastic bottles that they can sell in junkshops in Manila.

Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible. Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby.

People seem genuinely interested in the challenge I’ve set myself\u0026nbsp– but I’ve quickly learnt\u0026nbspthat while they initially want to listen to what I have to say, it doesn’t last very long.I can spot the exact moment where people switch off –\u0026nbspusually when I mention what my favourite type of tofu is or the perils of trying to make jackfruit taste like anything other than cardboard. It isn’t upsetting, but it’s a moment of realisation. It’s like going into work first thing on a Monday morning and asking someone how their weekend was you’re really just\u0026nbspdoing it out of politeness – let’s be honest, you don’t really care.One of the biggest worries I had about going vegan was that I would become the annoying person everyone has to accommodate for: you’re going to a restaurant, do they have vegan options? Nope, can’t go there.I’d like to think I’m quite a self-aware person. I know when I’m being annoying, or when people feel a certain type of way towards me.But whether I like it or not – and whether my friends, work colleagues or the people around me do too – turning vegan is (sadly) the most interesting thing about my life right now. It’s the biggest change to my life for as long as I can remember. The dramatics of this might seem high so read with a pinch of salt and don’t take it too seriously.Here’s my sub-pledge: I’m going to try and keep my conversations about veganism short and sweet. People are interested in what you have to say but not for too long.\u0026nbspHow do you know if someone is a vegan? Don’t worry, we’ll tell you.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They could be anything from sniffing hints of chemicals on alien worlds to indications that there could be structures or lasers on other planets.Dr Tony Beasley, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) telescope based in Virginia, US, said: Determining whether we are alone in the universe as technologically capable life is among the most compelling questions in science.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Scientists hope that citizen scientists will be able to find interesting things in the data – whether that is unknown natural phenomena, or something even more unexpected, such as alien life.“Since Breakthrough Listen’s initial data release last year, we have doubled what is available to the public,” said Breakthrough Listen’s lead system administrator, Matt Lebofsky. “It is our hope that these data sets will reveal something new and interesting, be it other intelligent life in the universe or an as-yet-undiscovered natural astronomical phenomenon.”Yuri Milner, an entrepreneur and founder of the Breakthrough initiative, said: For the whole of human history, we had a limited amount of data to search for life beyond Earth.So, all we could do was speculate.Now, as we are getting a lot of data, we can do real science and, with making this data available to general public, so can anyone who wants to know the answer to this deep question.The initiatives and strategies in expanding the search for extraterrestrial life were presented at the the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Seattle.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But in recent months it has started to dim in a way never before seen, and without explanation.Some astronomers had initially speculated that the star could be about to explode into a supernova, in a dramatic event that would be visible from Earth. But astronomers now think that something else is happening, which is changing the star in unexpected ways.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow new images show that fading brightness of the star, as well as the fact that the shape as it appears to us appears to be changing.As it has continued to dim, Betelgeuse is now about 36 per cent of its normal brightness. That is so dramatic that it can be seen with the naked eye, but further investigations with telescopes have attempted to learn more about the mysterious dimming.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Helpfully, they took a very similar image, using the same instrument, in January 2019 and before the dimming began – allowing them to compare the two images, and understand more about the changes that Betelgeuse has undergone.Rock at the edge of solar system changes our understanding of planetsResearchers now speculate that the star is not in fact about to go supernova, but is undergoing some other, similarly dramatic process. The new research helps give insight into red supergiants like Betelgeuse and what could happen to cause such unusual behaviour.The two scenarios we are working on are a cooling of the surface due to exceptional stellar activity or dust ejection towards us, said Miguel Montargès, an astronomer from KU Leuven in Belgium, who led the new study. Of course, our knowledge of red supergiants remains incomplete, and this is still a work in progress, so a surprise can still happen.Other images taken using the same Very Large Telescope show that the dust around Betelgeuse is emitting infrared light. That appears to happen when the material that makes up the star is spewed back into space.The phrase \u0027we are all made of stardust\u0027 is one we hear a lot in popular astronomy, but where exactly does this dust come from? siad Emily Cannon, a\u0026nbspPhD\u0026nbspstudent at KU\u0026nbspLeuven.Over their lifetimes, red supergiants like Betelgeuse create and eject vast amounts of material even before they explode as supernovae. Modern technology has enabled us to study these objects, hundreds of light-years away, in unprecedented detail giving us the opportunity to unravel the mystery of what triggers their mass loss.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS. It was designed for a global group of brands, which we no longer are.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder.

The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)At the beginning of the gig, Sir Elton announced he had been diagnosed with “walking pneumonia”, an infection in the respiratory tract.Later, on Instagram, the singer told fans he was “deeply upset” by the situation.He wrote: “I want to thank everyone who attended tonight’s gig in Auckland. I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia earlier today, but I was determined to give you the best show humanly possible.“I played and sang my heart out, until my voice could sing no more. I’m disappointed, deeply upset and sorry. I gave it all I had. Thank-you so much for your extraordinary support and all the love you showed me during tonight’s performance. I am eternally grateful. Love, Elton xx.”Sir Elton’s Auckland show was part of his 300-date Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, the last before he retires.In the recent documentary, Elton John: Uncensored, the singer revealed he was “24 hours from snuffing it” when he contracted a serious infection after having surgery for prostate cancer, and said he was so sick he “had to learn how to walk again”.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is particularly true in the south, where rents are rising the most.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS. It was designed for a global group of brands, which we no longer are.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Starmer plumped for Harold Wilson as the best Labour leader, while Nandy said “I’m hoping we are about to elect her.”Asked in a series of quickfire questions how she would vote in a referendum on keeping\u0026nbspthe monarchy, Ms Nandy replied: “I’m a democrat, so I would vote to scrap it, but actually this is not the priority as a country.”Long-Bailey vows to make it illegal for refuges to exclude trans womenStarmer \u0027not concerned\u0027 with being labelled a Blairite or a Corbynista‘Labour will win again only when it comes to love Tony Blair’Sir Keir said: “I wouldn’t.

That’s got to change now.”Ms Nandy said it had become “difficult to be in public life at the moment, because there is an unkindness that\u0027s crept into our public debate that I think is detrimental to all of us”.She said there should be “much greater support” made available to people suffering online abuse.And she added: “I think we need to start challenging the public discourse in this country.“It\u0027s not just that it is abusive and unkind, it is also that we have found multiple ways in the last decade to ide ourselves from each other.

Free health care? A jobs guarantee? Isn’t that socialism?Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo among celebrities backing Bernie SandersWhy the rise of Bernie Sanders is making some Democrats nervousWill bitter moderates vote for Bernie Sanders?But while policies such as free universal healthcare are seen as extreme in the US they are perfectly ordinary in Europe.The higher tax and spending proposed by Sanders would also not be out of place on the other side of the Atlantic.The economist Paul Krugman says Sanders is better described as a European-style social democrat rather than a socialist, not least because Sanders isn’t proposing to nationalise private industries.OK, but would this ruin the American economy?The French economist Thomas Piketty even argues Sanders’\u0026nbsppolicies could be beneficial to the US economy\u0026nbspby raising the country’s growth rate, and says that his wealth distribution policies tap into an older tradition of American policymaking.“Remember that the US is actually the country that invented progressive taxation of income and wealth in the 20th century,” Piketty points out.Others have described Sanders as a “New Dealer”, referring to the progressive economic policies put in place by former\u0026nbspDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s.So why are people describing Sanders as dangerous?But it may also be that the genuinely fear Sanders’ policies, even if they are in the mainstream of the European tradition, will do damage in the US context.Or they may be assuming that Sanders, if he won power, would pursue policies that go much further than those he has proposed, with the 78-year-old proving more radical in office, perhaps like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.Against this, though, is the institutional fact that US presidents are constrained by Congress in what policies they can enact. Sanders might be in favour of relatively radical redistribution, but that’s not true of the wider Democratic party.Even some of Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic nomination, such as Pete Buttigieg, are critical of his policies such as the $15 federal minimum wage.That’s why many analysts – even those who support the principle of “medicare-for-all” – think there is little chance he could actually deliver it, even if he won power.And while some financiers are sounding the alarm, others are more sanguine.Another Wall Street Bank, JPMorgan, recently told its clients that, even if Sanders were elected, “we put the probability of major changes like medicare-for-all or a wealth tax at less than 5 percent.”All of which raises a question: is the risk less that Sanders ruins the US economy than that he disappoints his supporters?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She later supported fellow Manchester MP Andy Burnham in the  Labour leadership race - a contest eventually won by Jeremy Corbyn.Under Mr Corbyn, Ms Nandy initially stayed in the shadow cabinet as an energy spokeswoman, but in the wake of the EU referendum she became one of a large group of shadow cabinet ministers to resign in protest at his leadership.Explaining her decision she said Mr Corbyn was unable to form a broad, inclusive shadow cabinet that draws on the best of our movements left and right traditions.The ballot for Labour Party members to vote opens on February  and closes on April .The next Labour leader is expected to be announced on April .Jeremy Corbyn said he would stay in place while the party decides who will take the crown.There is no deputy leader to fill the position after Tom Watson stood down as MP earlier this year.The stakes are high for the party after Corbyns failure to secure dozens of safe seats across the country and the alienation and disillusionment of many voters.A new leader will aim to claw back Labours losses following the  December election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Hou told Chinese news outlet The Paper: # Now any residential complex with confirmed cases will be disinfected [by them] twice a day.#Concerns over the practice self-isolating are being called into question in China after four members of the same family in Wuhan died.Chang Kai, a director at Hubei Film Studios, died on Friday aged  from pneumonia caused by coronavirus, according to an obituary published by his employer.His father, mother and older sister also died from the disease, according to media group Caixin.Health experts have rasied concerns that home quarantine can lead to more infections.Bizarre face masks that allow wearers to unlock their mobile phones while shielding their mouth and nose have appeared online.The mask can be strapped over the nose and mouth and has an image of the lower half of your face so it can #work with facial recognition software#.Sales of medical masks have gone through the roof in recent weeks is response to the coronavirus outbreak.One issue facing mask wearers is that they render facial recognition software on smartphones – such as Apples Face ID – useless.A San Francisco-based designer claims to have found a way around the issue with a new mask that #looks just like you#.

Billions, for sure.What’s interesting is that the ship did not go down with all hands lost.There were  survivors — and they were able to tell rescuers where the Nuestra Senora had sunk. That information has not been lost.So why are we just sitting back letting Spain and Mexico get on with it Britain needs money for its exciting new railway line and all the hospitals Boris Johnson has promised.Andthere’s a small mountain of it sitting at the bottom of the sea off Mexico’s east coast, why don’t we just sneak over there and help ourselves Certainly, our new six-year-old Chancellor should be considering this . . .  once he’s finished his morning bowl of Frosties and tidied his room.Think about it. We have naval ships in the region waging a hopeless war against South American drug cartels. So why not simply ask them to drive around with their sonar on I feel sure thatthis equipment can find a near-silent Russian submarine gently humming its way through the depths, it would have no trouble at all spotting  tons of gold and silver.Or we could draft in RRS Boaty McBoatface . That’s designed to map the seabed and would be a very useful tool.Frankly, having it in the Caribbean looking for treasure is a much better use of it than having it wandering around Antarctica studying penguins and looking for more dreary evidence of climate change. We know already.I bet the crew would be happier too.Of course, when we do find the loot, Spain will claim it’s theirs, in the same way they say they own Gibraltar.No worries. We’ll just behave like we do when the Greeks say they want the Elgin Marbles back.And Mexico  It’s true the jewels and the gold were sourced from their neck of the woods.But as every schoolboy knows, it’s “finders, keepers”.Britain has a reputation for fair play and decency, but in a cut-and-thrust world we need to be a bit more devious.Maybe then we could find the loot and tell the world we hadn’t. “Nope. Nothing there. Sorry.”IF I were to list all the Bond music in order of greatness – and being a man, EVERYTHING has to be listed like this – Octopussy’s All Time High by Rita Coolidge would be the all-time high.I love Rita Coolidge. She sounds like she’s singing while sitting down.At No, from On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, I’d have We Have All The Time In The World, by Louis ­Armstrong, who sounds like he’s lying down in the bath. And at No it’d be the ­incidental music used during the ski chase in the same movie.I’d have to go a long way down the list – past Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from ­Thunderball, past the music used in the cinema adverts before the film started, and down past the Muzak playing when I took my seat – before I got to the dreary song chosen for the ­latest  outing.Performed by Billie Eilish, it is about as memorable as the middle of a Tuesday night.LIKE lots of box-set enthusiasts, I was captivated by Netflix’s drama The Stranger.“Let’s do one more”, I’d say every night. “Come on. It’s only am.”Set in northern England and starring Richard Armitage, the plot twisted and turned, building to the point that in the final episode I started to wonder how all the endless storylines could all be brought together and tied off.I was intrigued. Fascinated. On the edge of my seat.And then – with a load of stuff still up in the air – it just ended.What I had sat through, then, was a beautully told eight-hour joke. With no punchline.THE BBC has signed up Greta Thunberg to present a new series about monster truck racing in Texas.Only kidding. She’s been signed to present a show on – you’ll never guess – climate change.“I can’t wait. It’ll be so exciting,” said no one.I’VE always said hybrid cars are too heavy, thanks to the fact they have two engines.And now this ­photo of a Toyota Prius proves it.NORMALLY, I’m in full agreement with The Sun’s television critic, Ally Ross.But his review of ­Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Lab show on Netflix was wide of the mark.He described it as “dumb and dangerous”.Wrong, mate. It was way worse than that.At one point, they had two women playing with a vibrator the size of a JCB.And somehow they managed to make the scene even more boring than The One Show.WHENEVER somebody builds a really good bridge, I’ll travel miles out of my way to go and look at it. I realise this is a bit tragic.My favourite bridge in the whole wide world spans the Humber.It’s so graceful and delicate – and when I stand at one end and watch it disappear into the mist on a summer’s morning, I often suffer from a small but embarrassing trouser moment.The only annoying thing about the Humber Bridge is that they went to all the trouble and expense of building it simply to connect the small village of Hessle to the even smaller village of Barton. Two places no one has ever heard of.The fabulous Oresund Bridge was needed because it links Sweden and Denmark.It’s the same story in San Francisco, which has many great bridges that connect the city to the rest of Calornia.That’s the point of a bridge. It links two places that need to be linked.Which brings me on to Boris Johnson’s plan to build a -mile bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.Hmmm. I’m aware the Chinese have built a sea bridge this long, but this is a nation that built a whole new coronavirus hospital in SIX DAYS.We are just not that fast. We can’t even build a new railway line without a -year argument.And the fact is that when we finish our new bridge, midway through the rd Century, we will have linked a place called Larne to a place called Portpatrick.Now, I don’t want to have a downer on the plan.Butwe are going to build a -mile bridge over the sea, wouldn’t it be more usefulit went from Dover to Calais Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.“I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work. I’m not writing this out of bitterness, I am writing out of disgust,” she wrote.Unfortunately, coming from someone who has been so integral in the protest movement, this sounds like sour grapes.Natalie’s response to Rose’s criticism was as elegant and as understated as her protest.She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it.“Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks.”She also responded to Rose’s accusation that Natalie has only been directed twice by women.But in this criticism, Rose is seriously missing the point. Female directors don’t get as far in Hollywood as male ones, which is precisely what Natalie is pointing out with her cloak protest. Therefore, there are fewer available to work with.As Natalie said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times . . . Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.“Female films have been incredibly hard to get made at studios, or to get independently financed. If these films do get made, women face enormous challenges during the making of them.”By the way, this is not the first time Natalie has protested from within the system.While presenting the best director category at the Golden Globes in , she introduced the line-up by saying: “And here are the all-male nominees.”Again, it’s not a shouty, noisy street protest. But it served to make her point. Just that she did it in a dferent way than Rose might. And that’s fine.In fact, some people think that Rose’s in-your-face type of protest risks alienating some people.I think women should support each other when it comes to vying for equality.But also, Rose just sounded spiteful when she said Natalie was “an actress acting like someone who cares”.Rose is a hero to many women. But she needs to understand that whether their contribution is big or small, loud or subtle, anyone’s effort to affect change helps.JANE Fonda, who looked fabulous at the Oscars, has said she is done with plastic surgery.Well, I guess  is as good an age as any to stop nipping and tucking.She must have a great doctor, as whatever the actress has had done has been done very well indeed – because, in my experience, it’s not often you look better after a facelt than you did before.PERHAPS Andrea Leadsom had a premonition that she was going to be axed as Business Secretary in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle.She recently wrote a column obliquely warning Boris Johnson not to cut the number of female ministers in his Cabinet.Addressing the issue of female board members among FTSE  companies, Andrea wrote: “Working in the City in the Nineties, I saw myself how a male-dominated environment can limit a career.”Unfortunately for her, the warning did not save her skin and she has been sacked, along with Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary and housing minister Esther McVey.By the way, eight of the  members of Mr Johnson’s first Cabinet were female –  per cent.Despite these sackings, that figure has actually risen – slightly – to nearly  per cent.Ideally, the split would be an even -.But the reality is that business and politics can both be brutal.Men and women alike must accept they might one day get the sack.It simply goes with the territory.Being selected on the basis of gender is just as wrong as being sacked on that basis.Right person, right job, regardless of their gender.THAT is what true equality means.SAY what you like about the bonkers lestyle advice dispensed by Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop – and some of it is seriously out there.But whatever she is doing clearly works.She is, at the age of , nothing short of radiant.In fact she looks amazing and also happy.Not only that but she became instantly relatable to parents everywhere with a confession that her -year- old daughter finds her embarrassing.That’s a good reminder there is nothing like a teenager to keep you normal and down to earth for fear that you will embarrass them, no matter what you do.Although, to be fair, perhaps Gwyneth’s daughter has had a predisposition to feel embarrassed by her mother ever since she named her  . . . Apple.What are the ethics of seat-reclining on a long-haul flight An American Airlines passenger raised the question after video-shaming a fellow traveller who punched and pushed her seat when she reclined it.Bearing in mind the recline button moves the seat about in, I suspect this chap has anger issues, as reclining a seat that has a recline button is hardly an act of aggression.I’d disable the recline button and then all you have to fight over is the armrest.DAMIAN Hurleys resemblance to his mother, Liz, is uncanny.More so than ever in the latest shots of the two of them together, which he posted online this week.Some people think it is vaguely unsettling that he looks more like Liz Hurley than Liz Hurley.But as a mum myself, I think it’s heartwarming a teenage boy should be so happy to emulate his mother.OH the utter folly of the face tattoo!The latest to succumb to this trend, which a few years ago would be, frankly, unthinkable, is Amber Rose.She has had the words Bash and Slash tattooed across her forehead in old English manuscript style.It’s a reference, apparently, to the model’s three-month-old son Slash, and six-year-old son Sebastian. And, obviously, it’s lovely that she loves her children so much.But tattooing their names on her forehead where they will remain for all her le  All I can say is: Tattoo in haste . . . repent at leisure.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We truly do.But do Harry and Meghan understand and ever admit to themselves that they owe EVERYTHING to their royal connections Without the magic dust that royalty bestows, JP Morgan — one of the world’s richest banks — would never have flown them in a private jet to an exclusive company beano. Don’t tell Greta Thunberg!And without his royal blood, Prince Harry would not be in talks with Goldman Sachs about a future relationship.If they were not British royalty, Meghan would be a B-list actress whom few people had ever heard of and Harry an old soldier with two rotten A-levelsfrom Eton — a school where my dog Stan could get four good grades and an offer from Oxbridge.I do not doubt Harry and Meghan’s sincerity when they say they want to be financially independent.But because they are poncing on royal connections, the couple have a duty of care to the Queen and to this country.Please don’t embarrass the Royal Family, or British people who shelled out £million for your wedding.Please do not turn into the preening glove puppets of investment bankers.Oh Harry, please don’t turn into Tony Blair in a tiara.Oh Meghan, don’t become the st-century Fergie.Prince Andrew’s reckless friendship with convicted billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein has humiliated and damaged the Royal Family.Andrew’s total lack of judgment may have done irreparable harm to the monarchy.Many of us wonderthe institution will last after the Queen has gone.So show some dignity, Harry and Meghan. Engage your brains, not your bank balance.Have a little DISCRETION. Please do not pimp your royal connections to any passing dodgy billionaire or investment banker who claims to care deeply about your charity work.Frankly, it doesn’t look good so far.The nation cringed when Prince Harry buttonholed Disney boss Bob Iger at the London premiere of The Lion King, aggressively pitching Meghan’s availability for “voiceover” work.A member of the Royal Family begging a Hollywood big-shot for work was not a pretty sight.When they handed in their letter of resignation, Harry and Meghan made lofty announcements about “collaborating” with the Queen, as though Her Majesty, , is some grime DJ who could be brought in to remix their latest single.The brutal truth is that we will not see much of Harry and Meghan in these parts.This week they sacked  loyal UK staff and shut their Buckingham Palace office.But by turning their backs on the royal le, Harry and Meghan have placed themselves in an almost impossible situation.They claim to want to be financially independent of Prince Charles and the British taxpayer.Then they will have to grab the big pay days where they can.They will have to earn phenomenal sums of money to fund the lavish lestyle to which they are accustomed.But there is absolutely nothing in either of their CVs to suggest they can make that kind of dough without flogging their royal connections to the highest bidder.If Harry and Meghan are going to support themselves, they are going to have to get their hands dirty in the working world.Harry’s discussions with Goldman Sachs may be focused on his charity work right now, but investment bankers are not renowned for their boundless human compassion.Big bankers — and mega-rich companies like Netflix and Apple — will look at Harry and Meghan and wonder what they can get out of them.Harry and Meghan are free to demean themselves, as Harry did so spectacularly when he shook his diamond-encrusted begging bowl at the boss of Disney.But please don’t demean this country.Please don’t debase the Royal Family, as Prince Andrew has done.Please, Harry and Meghan — do not embarrass the Queen.Because let’s face it, chaps — without your royal connections, the pair of you really don’t add up to very much at all.After all those wild decades, Keith – who is said to have smoked an estimated , fags in his time – clearly believes in moderation in all things.Especially moderation in moderation.IN a pithy turn of phrase worthy of Oscar Wilde, one commentator mused that Labour’s dishevelled Tracy Brabin looked like she had been “banged over a wheelie bin” in her off-the-shoulder frock in the House of Commons.Showing Tracy how it is done, Kate Beckinsale looked stunning in a very similar off-the-shoulder number at a pre-Oscars party.Kate also looks as though she has never even seen a wheelie bin.But it’s not true. I recall Debbie Harry was a dazzling double NME winner in  – Pin-Up Of The Year and Best Female Singer.The NME may be  years old. But NME award winners never get any older.THE coronavirus could well be China’s Chernobyl – the national calamity that changes everything.As the global death toll of the virus nears ,, the old men in Beijing who run China have never looked so woefully out of their depth.The greatest hero in China today is Dr Li Wenliang, the -year-old Wuhan doctor who tried to warn the Communist regime of the virus.Dr Li was arrested, bullied, humiliated, accused of scaremongering and later died of the virus.That is what happens in a one-party state that considers all criticism to be treason.China does not look like the next economic superpower today.China looks like an inept one-party state that failed to grasp the seriousness of the virus, then stubbornly refused to heed the warnings that could have contained it, and has now exported it to the rest of the world.The coronavirus came out of the so-called wet markets of China, where every conceivable animal is kept in filthy conditions to cater for the Chinese appetite for “exotic” animals.Wolf pups, koala bears and assorted rats, bats and snakes are all on offer for the discerning wildle gourmet, many under the counter.These markets were the breeding ground for Sars nearly  years ago, and they were the breeding ground for the coronavirus.Exactly how stupid can a regime be that allows the existence of these unregulated markets  The virus that is now polluting the entire planet was totally avoidable.Mikhail Gorbachev was convinced that the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in  caused the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later.The Chernobyl explosion “opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression”, said Gorbachev. “To the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue.”If the coronavirus brings down China’s ruling Communist elite, it will be exactly what they deserve.Now Leo has seen his Fine Gael party poll a wretched . per cent of the vote in the Irish general election, going from power to third place overnight.Looks like Leo Varadkar is a teeny-weeny politician now.Now BBC chairman David Clementi squeaks that ending the licence fee will mean scrapping children’s channel CBeebies.Stop our money and you will make all the kiddies cry!But the openly biased BBC stopped being a state broadcaster years ago.It no longer deserves to be funded like one.TANYA McDonnell is a modern success story.Tanya was working in McDonald’s in Washington, Tyne-and-Wear, for £ an hour until a modelling agency spotted her holiday shots on Instagram.“I’d always looked up to people like Kate Moss,” says Tanya. “But I didn’t think I had a chance because I wasn’t pretty enough.”Only in the age of social media could a girl go from having her picture taken on holiday to making a living as a model.And only in the age of social media could someone who looks like Tanya McDonnell fret that she is not pretty enough.I didn’t know he had one.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is completely fake news.I do not understand why these people are still lying while having the facts. I can only say that these people are deeply prejudiced against China.”The leaked document exposes what seems to be a state surveillance in the region, targeting those who practice their culture or religion.This is the third major leak of sensitive Chinese government documents showing a potential sinister program designed to promote ethnic unity.Women from the Muslim minority were found to have been forced to share a bed with and even marry men from the Han majority who are appointed by the Communist state, it is claimed.The much-criticised Pair Up and Become Family program joins a long list of alleged human rights violations carried out by Xi Jinpings regime against Muslims in the northwest region of Xinjiang.They have also been accused of raping Muslims held in re-education camps, forcing them to have abortions and imprisoning Muslim men en-masse."},{"url":null,"title":"eu trade deal publishing plan shelved","story":"Boris Johnson’s chief adviser David Frost had wanted to try to gain the upper hand in the tense talks by forcing Brussels to work to Britain’s blueprint.The plan was devised after the EU stole a march on the UK in the exit deal negotiation by being the first to flesh out detailed terms.Officials from across a series of Whitehall departments have already drawn up legal text for the complex project over the last two months, The Sun has learned.But the Exit Strategy committee of senior Cabinet ministers, chaired by the PM, decided to halt the plan after opting for a dferent strategy.Britain’s negotiating cards are instead being kept close to its chest so as not to give the EU any pointers on Boris’s bottom lines, and detailed arguments have been stripped out of all government pronouncements for now.A Whitehall source said: “The XS Committee decided it was better to give nothing away at the moment.

In view of the increasing demand, we have adapted the courtyard to increase its capacity.”Cabinet minister Therese Coffey slammed the spending, tweeting: “I see House authorities have brought in sofas and luxury armchairs to the Atrium in Portcullis House.

Mr Frost said: The EU is going find this much, much more dficult.He added: Looking forward, we are going to have a huge advantage over the EU – the ability to set regulations for new sectors, the new ideas, and new conditions – quicker than the EU can, and based on sound science not fear of the future.I have no doubt that we will be able to encourage new investment and new ideas in this way – particularly given our plans to boost spend on scientic research, attract scientists and make Britain the best country in the world to do science. And hammering home the message that Mr Johnson is not bluffing when he says he will not be signing up to EU level playing-field rules, Mr Frost said: Independence does not mean a limited degree of freedom infor accepting some of the norms of the central power.It means – independence – just that. I recognise that some in Brussels might be uncomfortable with that – but the EU must,it is to achieve what it wants in the world, find a way of relating to its neighbours as friends and genuinely sovereign equals.Europe’s leaders have insisted we sign up to a “level playing field” on workers’ rights and state bailouts as the price for a trade deal.Mr Frost said Boris Johnson’s stand “isn’t a simple negotiating position which might move under pressure”.Warning the PM will instead walk away without a deal, he insisted: “We bring not some clever tactical positioning but the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country.”He added of being in the EU: “We never knew what we really wanted to achieve other than stop other countries do what other countries wanted to do.“It’s so bizarre people told themselves Britain was winning the arguments or the EU is a British project. It’s clearly not.”And it’s ludicrous for the  EU nations to pretend “alignment” is necessary.The bloc removed . per cent of tarf lines in its trade deal with Korea, and  per cent in its deal with Japan.These countries don’t have to follow the EU’s trade rules, so why on earth should Britain We would welcome a deal with the EU,it could be agreed on reasonable terms.

Kate welcomed her first royal tot back in July , while well-wishers around the world excitedly waited for updates. While she admitted knowing fans and photographers were lining the streets outside the hospital was terrying, she said she did her best to compartmentalise and enjoyed the special day. She spoke openly about those precious moments with Giovanna Fletcher during an interview on her podcast Happy Mum, Happy Baby. In her most candid interview yet, organised to promote her  Big Questions survey, she discussed a number of topics including mum guilt, her horric pregnancies and giving birth. Asked what it was like holding her son for the first time, she replied: Amazing, amazing. It is extraordinary as I’ve said. How can the human body do that  It is utterly extraordinary actually. And he was very sweet . And also sort of relieved that he was a happy, healthy boy. She also gave a heartwarming description of Williamaposs reaction to becoming a dad. Seeing, you know your husband, William, and things like that. Seeing the pure joy of his face it was really special.  Speaking about the pressure of knowing the whole world was waiting for updates on her birth, Kate admitted she was terried. Giovanna asked: What was it like knowing that so many people outside, after you’ve given birth and you’re in your little cocoon with your new family, what’s it like  Kate replied: Yeah, slightly terrying, slightly terrying, I’m not going to lie. I like to decompartmentalise - what’s the word – compartmentalise, yes, the whole thing. She also explained why she decided to follow in her mother-in-law Princess Dianaaposs footsteps and pose on the hospital footsteps with her little bundle of joy.  She said: Everyone had been so supportive and both William and I were really conscious that this was something that everyone was excited about and you know we’re hugely grateful for the support that the public had shown us, and actually for us to be able to share that joy and appreciation with the public, I felt was really important. But equally it was coupled with a new-born baby, and inexperienced parents, and the uncertainty of what that held, so there were all sorts of mixed emotions. Asked how long she had between giving birth and posing on the Lindo Wing steps, Kate said: Oh my gosh, I can’t remember. Everything goes in a bit of a blur. The Duchess of Cambridge shared lots of sweet details about her children and giving birth during interview on Giovanna Fletcheraposs Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast. These are some of our highlights...Speaking about why she decided to introduce Prince George to the world on the steps of the Lindo Wing: Everyone had been so supportive and both William and I were really conscious that this was something that everyone was excited about and you know we’re hugely grateful for the support that the public had shown us, and actually for us to be able to share that joy and appreciation with the public, I felt was really important. Admitting they practised the famous aposcar seatapos moment with a doll: We were like ‘What do we do ... in a swaddle ’. ‘How’s this supposed to work !’. We’d even tried to practice with a little baby, like a little doll, at home but you know it just never works out the way you planned it so it was quite hard to do that on the world’s stage, but no, he did a very good job. On holding Prince George for the first time: Amazing, amazing. It is extraordinary as I’ve said. How can the human body do that  It is utterly extraordinary actually. And he was very sweet. And also sort of relieved that he was a happy, healthy boy. Williamaposs panicked question about parenting: It wasn’t that quiet in our household. William was like ‘Oh my gosh is this what parenting is going to be like  On her experience with hypnobirthing: I’m not going to say that William was standing there sort of, chanting sweet nothings at me. He definitely wasn’t! I didn’t even ask him about it, but it was just something I wanted to do for myself. On her mum guilt: Anyone who doesnapost as a mother is actually lying. Even this morning, coming to the nursery visit here - George and Charlotte were like aposMummy how could you possibly not be dropping us off as school this morning apos Itaposs a constant challenge.

Sending the army to fill sandbags is a sticking plaster.”  nEven with river levels rising and more than a month’s rain falling in  hours in places, it is feared that more chaos and destruction is to come.  nMs Terry added: “As temperatures rise, the atmosphere can hold more water so downpours are more intense – % more for every degree celsius temperature increase – so flooding will increase. We are currently in a national emergency.”  nMPs blasted the Government for its lack of action on climate change.  n  nStorm Dennis: School submerged under water as head makes all-night rescue attempt  nStorm Dennis: Woman swept away by floodwater during torrential rain found dead   nAlex Davies-Jones, Labour MP for Pontypridd, said: “This is a big wake-up call. Areas are flooding which have not flooded before.  nWe have to make sure they don’t flood again but also tackle climate change long term.  n“The Government must wake up to the fact we need to do something drastic now or we will have more situations like this.”  n  nEnvironment Agency chief Sir James Bevan warned the crisis “is not yet over”, telling people living near the Ouse and Severn rivers to be on high alert as “signicant flooding” is expected later this week.  nHis agency issued a record  warnings over the weekend and  properties were flooded.  n“Something has changed,” he said. “The climate emergency is driving more violent weather, higher seas and heavier rainfall. We need an approach.”  nPhilip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, had said “precious little” was done after the  floods and urged the government to “pull its finger out”.  nBut Sir James said “a lot is being done”, highlighting a £.billion investment in flood prevention and a further £billion being offered for the next few years. He added: “You can’t make the whole country flood-proof.”  nHe also said “iniduals have a role to play”, adding that one in six British homes is at risk of flooding.  n  nMs Terry wants to see more funding for the Environment Agency, local authorities and fire and rescue services. She added: “Spending on vital sea defences and flood barriers has to increase in worst-hit areas.  n“Some communities will need to move – there are no relocation plans in place so a national debate about floods is urgently required. Planning laws need revision so councils can turn down homes in flood plains.”  nHannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, added: “We’ve always seen big floods but we keep seeing these records broken.

The clean-up bill could run into billions.  nYork city centre was inundated by water from the River Ouse.  nLabour MP for Rhondda Chris Bryant called the situation in South Wales “heartbreaking”. He said people from some of the UK’s poorest areas “lost everything”.  nBut there is more to come with the Environment Agency and Met Office experts predicting “further signicant” floods and  hours of torrential rain.  nSome  flood warnings are in place across the country.  n  nIt comes as a woman who was swept away in Tenbury, Worcs, on Sunday, was named.  nWest Mercia Police said they found a body they believe to be Yvonne Booth, , of Great Barr, Birmingham.  nHer family said: “Yvonne is a very much loved member of our family and we are all devastated by this news.”  n  nTwo men died off the Kent coast at the weekend.

Storms Ciara and Dennis have ravaged communities and with more heavy rain forecast, environmental scientist Angela Terry said: “As a country we are not preparing. Sending the army to fill sandbags is a sticking plaster.” As river levels rising and more than a month’s rain falling in  hours in places, it is feared that more chaos and destruction is to come. Ms Terry added: “As temperatures rise, the atmosphere can hold more water so downpours are more intense – % more for every degree celsius temperature increase – so flooding will increase. We are currently in a national emergency.” MPs blasted the Government for its lack of action on climate change. Alex Davies-Jones, Labour MP for Pontypridd, said: “This is a big wake-up call. Areas are flooding which have not flooded before. We have to make sure they don’t flood again but also tackle climate change long term. “The Government must wake up to the fact we need to do something drastic now or we will have more situations like this.”  Environment Agency chief Sir James Bevan warned the crisis “is not yet over”, telling people living near the Ouse and Severn rivers to be on high alert as “signicant flooding” is expected later this week. His agency issued a record  warnings over the weekend and  properties were flooded.“Something has changed,” he said. “The climate emergency is driving more violent weather, higher seas and heavier rainfall. We need an approach.”Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, had said “precious little” was done after the  floods and urged the government to “pull its finger out”. But Sir James said “a lot is being done”, highlighting a £.billion investment in flood prevention and a further £billion being offered for the next few years. He added: “You can’t make the whole country flood-proof.” He also said “iniduals have a role to play”, adding that one in six British homes is at risk of flooding.  Ms Terry wants to see more funding for the Environment Agency, local authorities and fire and rescue services. She added: “Spending on vital sea defences and flood barriers has to increase in worst-hit areas. “Some communities will need to move – there are no relocation plans in place so a national debate about floods is urgently required. Planning laws need revision so councils can turn down homes in flood plains.” Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, added: “We’ve always seen big floods but we keep seeing these records broken. These types of events are most likely a taster of what is to come. Clearly, we are not ready for them.” Britainaposs flood hell as communities say aposwe canapost copeapos  Flooded communities still reeling from Storm Dennis are facing more misery this week. Six “danger to le” warnings were issued for the rivers Lugg, Teme, Severn and Wye in Wales and western England. Flood warnings are also in place in Upton-upon-Severn and Uckinghall, Worcs, with residents advised to evacuate after the River Severn burst its banks, closing roads in Shrewsbury.  Major incidents were declared in Hereford, Worcestershire and parts of South Wales as the joint death toll from Dennis and Storm Ciara hit seven. Hundreds of people have been evacuated with , properties damaged by the two storms. The clean-up bill could run into billions. York city centre was inundated by water from the River Ouse. Labour MP for Rhondda Chris Bryant called the situation in South Wales “heartbreaking”.He said people from some of the UK’s poorest areas “lost everything”.But there is more to come with the Environment Agency and Met Office experts predicting “further signicant” floods and  hours of torrential rain.Some  flood warnings are in place across the country.  It comes as a woman who was swept away in Tenbury, Worcs, on Sunday, was named. West Mercia Police said they found a body they believe to be Yvonne Booth, , of Great Barr, Birmingham. Her family said: “Yvonne is a very much loved member of our family and we are all devastated by this news.” Two men died off the Kent coast at the weekend. A climber on Ben Nevis also died, though the cause is unclear. Ciara caused three fatalities. Communities spoke of the devastation.In Hereford, flood water from the River Wye was so deep it covered goal posts at the Cathedral School.Nursery boss Laura Yarwood, , said the “crazy” floods were “the worst anyone in Hereford has seen”. She added: “I think most of the villages have been cut off and there’ve been quite a few evacuations.”  Locals in South Wales grabbed shovels to start the clean-up while others recalled their escapes. Dad-of-two Daniel Patterson, , frantically tried to salvage precious possessions after his we, Terri O’Donnell, , woke him at am. She had heard water pouring into their home in the village of Nantgarw.  Daniel told the Mirror: “I went downstairs and could not believe what I was seeing – the water was coming through the letterbox. “The water was at my ankles so I was rushing round trying to get everything I could upstairs. By then I had two screaming children and a very distressed partner, which made things very stressful. “By am the water was round my waist and I had to just abandon ship. “We have lost a lot, mainly our baby photos, which is very upsetting.”  Daniel, Terri, and their children, Harper, five and Blake, one, went to his mum’s house in Barry, but ed to inspect their home yesterday. Terri said: “It was devastating to look at  years of memories lost. “Seeing the children’s toys covered in mud was the worst.” Paralegal Caroline Jones, , told how her husband, Richard saved their dog after their home was inundated.  She said: “My first thought was the dog, who sleeps in the bathroom. Richard had to wade down there and knock the door down. The dog was drowning – it was horrible, but we got him. “Questions need to be asked about how this happened.” Gordon Churchill, also from Nantgarw, was rescued on his th birthday with daughter Carolyn, who save his treasured RAF medals. Some homeowners living next to the River Taff, in Pontypridd, felt they had been abandoned. Robin Williams, , said: “Where’s Boris  Where’s the help ” Warning of more “heavy” downpours tomorrow and Thursday, Bonnie Diamond from the Met Office said: “There is rain in places where it isn’t really welcome.” Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf Council, said the region faced a “multi-million” bill to repair “roads, parks, bridges, flood defences and community buildings”. Boris Johnson hides from crisis Boris Johnson was today holed up in Chevening, a grace-and-favour mansion in Kent, refusing to convene a Cobra meeting or visit traumatised families dealing with the Storm Dennis floods."},{"url":null,"title":"storm dennis couple devastated caf","story":"w.mantis  Storm Dennis: Couple devastated as café ravaged by floodwater months after opening n Darren and Emma Hughes, who run the Canal View Café in Resolven, say their business has been destroyed by the flooding across Wales n A couple have shared their devastation after Storm Dennis left their new café submerged in sewage water.  nDarren and Emma Hughes have run the Canal View Café in Resolven, Neath Port Talbot since only last November, and were shocked when their new business became the latest victim of the flooding which has swept across Wales.  nImages show the full extent of the damage, which Darren and Emma say will cost thousands to repair, Wales Online reports. nThe café has been wiped out, the river bank burst and the water is ft high, Darren said.  n  nStorm Dennis: River levels smash -year-old records after deadly flooding   nMum trapped under bed for  hours feared she would die after arm aposburstapos  nThe -year-old says that the premises will now need a total refurb.  nHe added: The whole place will need ripping out and replacing, the sewage water has gone into the cookers.  nMy we and the whole family have been very upset.

Her Majesty has numerous properties but her official home is the -room palace in Westminster - and thereaposs always an incentive for her to keep coming back.  The -year-old is presented with a small bunch of flowers from the royal grounds, hand-selected by the gardens manager, according to gardening guru Alan Titchmarsh.The former presenter of Ground Force said a little bouquet made up of half a dozen dferent types of flowers is placed on her desk on arriving back from Windsor, reports The Sun.Mr Titchmarsh, also an avid writer, told the Radio Times: She [the Queen] has a little posy cut for her every Monday, which is placed on her desk when she gets back from Windsor. aposIt will typically have six or seven dferent types of flowers from the garden to give her a little snapshot of whataposs looking good at that time. Keen to show off their labours, the groundsapos gardeners delight in seeing the best picks given to their boss, and can include anything from honeysuckle, winter jasmine and blueberries, and more.  The Queen loves plants and gardens - on visiting the Cha Flower Show with Prince Philip in  she told staff her green-fingered interests have increased of late. And Robert Hillier, chairman of Hillier Nurseries, who spoke to HRH at the show, recalled: She has never shown her knowledge before.  “We have met many times but suddenly she is so interested in plants and planting.  “She obviously enjoys going to Cha, but in the past she has not been so animated. She has got really into gardening. Itaposs never too late! Eight full-time gardeners, with additional part-time staff hired as required, maintain the lawns and flowers at Buckingham Palace - with the Grade II listed gardens covering  acres. On top of the  trees and  plus types of wildflowers, the gardens also boast a summerhouse, tennis court and helicopter pad. The Queen can wander around the three-acre lake or rose garden whenever she fancies a break from work inside the palace.

Lisa and Tom Bilyeu instantly fell for one another after meeting almost two decades ago - and have gone on to share the secrets to a successful marriage. In a post revealing their best advice for other couples, they named having sex often as their number one tip. This was followed by aposcommunicating obsessivelyapos, and being honest with one another - aposespecially when itaposs hardapos. The couple, who co-founded billion dollar health brand Quest Nutrition, also said forgiving mistakes fast and always wanting the other person to win were keys to happiness. They also said making marriage your highest priority will help maintain a strong bond.Revealing details of lessons learnt over the past  years, Lisa said on Instagram:When you love someone so damn much all you want to do is see them happy.  Seeing Tom smile and laugh is literally one of my most favorite things on earth. And so knowing that what you are about to say is going to do the exact opposite  Well my instincts are always to just keep it to myself. But in not saying it, for Tom and I, is as bad as lying.  We plan to be married forever and so it needs to be built on  per cent honesty and transparency. And so when Iaposm  years old and a bag of wrinkles, and I wake up with no make up on and he looks at me and tells me Iaposm beautul, he needs those moments to carry weight.

We have been proved positive and leaving for hospital soon. Blessings all.But he later told friends he didnapost believe the results, writing: Frankly i think this is a setup! We are NOT being taken to a hospital but a hostel. That’s where partners are sent waiting out there quarantine. Are you on board the ship or have you been affected by the coronavirus outbreak  Email webnews@mirror. No phone, no wi-fi and no medical facilities. I really am smelling a very big rat here! Waiting for the transfer now. He told a friend: I doubt it was positive. If it was, we would be in hospital. Mr Abel wrote that he and his we - who were on the cruise to celebrate their wedding anniversary - would be removed from the ship together but they might be separated once they arrive at a hostel. The vessel has been in quarantine at a port in Yokohama for two weeks.

David Abelaposs blog update on Monday:  The department has faced pressure to fly home the  Britons on the Diamond Princess after the US chartered two planes and repatriated  of its citizens. Given the conditions on board, we are working to organise a flight back to the UK for British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible, a statement from the department said. Our staff are contacting British nationals on board to make the necessary arrangements. We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately.  Earlier, a Number  spokesman said those on board the ship were being contacted about the possibility of a repatriation flight. On Monday, the Japanese Health Ministry confirmed  more people on board have been diagnosed with the illness, bringing the total to . Four Britons with confirmed coronavirus are currently in hospital in Japan, according to the latest official figures.  The data comes after Sir Richard Branson said Virgin Atlantic was in discussions with the Government over whether he could help those stranded.He responded via Twitter to an appeal from Mr and Mrs Abel, who asked the British businessman and philanthropist to charter a special plane.The coupleaposs son Steve Abel renewed appeals for the Government to help his parents, who he fears may become separated in Japan.

Paul Hartley played him further back in front of me and whoever I was partnering but I always felt he was more of a threat further up the pitch.“He creates real problems for defenders because they don’t know whether to follow him when he naturally drops back.“What Gowser does is take real care of the ball when he’s got it and he turns and can see a pass.“The ball he played through for Kane Hemmings’ second goal had to be right and he set the goal up.“I was delighted with Gowser up front and with Kane next to him.”With striking options limited following Danny Johnson’s departure in January and Andrew Nelson’s surgery, James says that plan would have been put to use the previous week against Morton.However, a knock picked up in training ruled McGowan out of the draw at Cappielow.And it was sporting director Gordon Strachan who reminded the Dark Blues manager of the possibility.McGowan started his career at Celtic while Strachan was manager at Parkhead and was given his debut in an advanced position.James added: “It’s something we would have done earlierwe could have.“We probably would have done it at Morton.“He started his career out there. That’s what Gordon keeps saying to me.“He played there when Gordon was at Celtic.“Gordon gave him his debut. He played in the Champions League for him against Villareal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dens gaffer players have to pay back dundee fans","story":"Dundee boss James McPake expects his players to give the club’s fans something back in the last few months of the season as they target a second-place finish.It’s been a trying first season as a manager for the -year-old at Dens Park with form and fortunes of his side fluctuating from week to week.After two positive results in their last two outings – a - draw at Cappielow against Morton followed up by a commanding - success over bottom side Partick Thistle – the Dark Blues gaffer is hard at work trying to stretch those reults into an extended run of form that can see Dundee earn themselves a place in the end-of-season play-offs.At times, the club’s fans have voiced their frustration at the team’s inability to prove any sort of challenge to runaway leaders Dundee United.James understands that but was pleased to see another side to the home support in last weekend’s win over the Jags.“We gave them a reason to get behind us,” he said.“Early in the game, Kane Hemmings chased a ball down, it rebounds off the defender and we get a throw-in – everybody is buzzing just because Kano chased a ball.“The supporters are then up for it and they see the players are up for it, too, with balls into the box early on.”That was a prime example of the players getting the crowd onside and the manager is demanding more of that, particularly with four home games coming up in the six matches after next Saturday’s trip to Queen of the South.Arbroath and Alloa are a home double-header before Dunfermline and then Queens check in to Dens before the end of March.“We have to give them something to be proud of – I said as much in my first interview,” he added.“I think last Saturday the fans were proud of their team.“We might not have knocked the ball about or played as fluently as we have this season but we got the three points and came away with a clean sheet and looked really comfortable.“The fans will have walked away really happy.“I think that was probably the first time at Dens this season where they walked away saying ‘it was good today’.“We have to do that, it has to come from us.“The fans will help us when it’s backs to the wall but we need to give them something.“Last Saturday we did.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e469273da7011.46985477-scaled.jpg ","title":"head coach at lochee amateurs boxing club says young pair can go down same path as rising star sam hickey","story":"Lochee Amateur Boxing Club’s Jerry Howett believes two of his brightest talents can follow in the footsteps of rising star Sam Hickey.Head coach Howett has high hopes for his son Brendan and Luca Flynn and thinks they have just as much potential as former Lochee ABC boxer Hickey – now training with Team Scotland in Glasgow.Both have enjoyed winning starts to the year with Howettearning gold at the Northern District Open Championships  days ago.  Flynnregistered a silver at the same event, following up from his gold at the Scottish Intermediate Championships.And Howett, who comes from a boxing family entrenched in the Lochee community, is delighted with how the pair are progressing.He said: “Luca did well to win at the intermediate Scottish Championships. He had to fight three times, beating last year’s Scottish champion in the semis.“He lost to him in the final of the Northern District Championships but a silver from that is still very good.“He was a bit disappointed but that’s the way it goes sometimes.“Brendan did really well to win the Northern District. He had to fight twice against a couple of tough boys.”Howett feels all his young stars can aspire to reach the heights of former Lochee greats Billy Buchanan, Ronnie Clark and Mike Towell.“Luca used to do gymnastics, which was a bit of a help when he first came but he’s took to the movement in boxing really well.“We’ve got high hopes for him going forward. He could win the Scottish Open Championships at the end of the month.“Luca’s dedication is good and Brendan will get up in the morning to go running and look after his diet.“Brendan’s in for the Senior Open Championships in March, which is a big one because it counts towards being picked for the Commonwealth Games squad in .“He went last year and did well in his first season as a senior so he’s hoping to go one better.“We’ve had Sam, who’s full-time with Boxing Scotland and has went on to earn European medals and win the British Championships, so he’s progressing well.“It’s good to see them taking their chances and there’s more talent to come – Ali Mahmood, Logan Howett and Lennon Mitchell for example. vw, px\"  “Sam is travelling all over now. He’s had assessments with the British squad as well but not quite got in there. Even young Luca is working his way through the Boxing Scotland system. He’s one for the future.”It can be stressful but Howett believes the rewards are worth it.“The building wasn’t getting used for a while but we got it back up and running again with our boxing section.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

However, NHS Lothian will work closely with the management going forward to ensure their budget is managed more effectively, and that the issues at hand are adequately addressed.Members of Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council have also told health bosses that the proposed boundary expansion would be ldquoa step in the wrong direction.The group contacted the Primary Care Contractor Organisation, stressing that it was ldquoabsolutely opposed to any change in the boundary area.Members also called for a meeting with health bosses, which took place recently at the practice and involved: Irene Tait, community council chairperson Margaret Stewart, community council secretary Holly Kilday, a community council member Dr Richard Fairclough and Dr Joana Stenke of Riverside Medical Practice ward councillors Stuart Currie and Katie Mackie Iain Gorman, East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnershiprsquos head of operations and Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, chairperson of East Lothian Integration Joint Board.The community councillors highlighted complaints they had received from members of the community, including:A statement issued by the community council following the discussion said: ldquoWe wondered why on earth the practice would want to take on more of a workload when clearly they are not coping with what they have to deal with at present.ldquoThe practice acknowledged the fact that they had undergone many changes in the last few years, not least the fact that they are on their third telephone system.ldquoThe practice also stated they will need to step up to the mark with a communication plan, making sure that everyone in our community is aware of how the practice is working and what options are available to them.ldquoThe expectation from the public is,they phone for a doctorsrsquo appointment, they will see a doctor and this is not always going to be the case.ldquoWhen you call you will be given two options, same day or non-urgent, and this will enable the staff to put you on to the right person who can help and this could be NHS , paramedics, physio, mental health or occupational therapistor alternatively, a doctornecessary on the same day.Wrong direction ldquoWe discussed the boundaries and made them aware that we felt that to take on Blindwells would be a step in the wrong direction.ldquoThe meeting was quite positive and hopefully, moving forward, we will keep in touch with the practice and they with us so that everyone is kept informed.Dr Stenke and Dr Fairclough issued a joint statement, saying: ldquoWe were delighted to meet with the Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council representatives and local councillors. We felt it was a really positive opportunity to discuss many of the changes that have happened in Musselburgh over the last few years to stabilise and develop primary care services.ldquoIt is really important for us at Riverside to understand the views of the community we serve, which can be hugely supportive in improving services. For example, feedback on our old phone system helped us to understand the issues that our patients were experiencing and led to us developing a new telephone system that was more suitable for our patientsrsquo needs as well as those of the practice.ldquoRiverside, along with other practices in the county, are collaborating with and supporting East Lothianrsquos Health and Social Care Partnershiprsquos plan to grow health services to meet the needs of a growing population.ldquoWe remain keen to improve our engagement and communication with the local community, and the meeting was a positive step to build links with local groups.ldquoWe are grateful to the community council representatives and local councillors for taking the time to visit us at Riverside Medical Practice and we look forward to developing a closer and collaborative relationship with them.An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: ldquoWe thought the meeting with Riverside and the community council was very positive. We were impressed by Riversidersquos commitment to engaging with the community and communicating developments. We look forward to supporting them in any way that we can.Councillor Mackie added: ldquoIt was a helpful meeting with community stakeholders and local GPs.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

Wersquove got the -bed hospital, the home of the medical school, wersquove got the universityrsquos research home here itrsquos already a melting pot of amazing people and amazing work, said Ms Stamp.She added: ldquoBioQuarter can be a lot more again and that is the transformational vision we have: to take BioQuarter today and its amazing attributes and put it on to the global path, to expand signicantly in terms of its numbers, in terms of who we attract, the types of innovators we want to attract.An architect by training, Ms Stamp said the scheme under development will include all the elements of a good place.ldquoIt will be a place where people want to work, to play, to discover hellip we train the next generation of doctors here, the next generation of innovators so we want to attract the absolute best students, so a place where you would want to spend your seven yearrsquos training.The plan should provide a signicant boost to the regeneration of south-east Edinburgh, with improved transport links and job opportunities for local people in prospect.A lot of work is being done to build links with the local community. Ms Stamp is keen to ensure that school children in nearby Craigmillar are encouraged to feel they could become one of the innovators working at the BioQuarter.She believes its expansion will help reinforce Scotlandrsquos reputation as a centre of innovation in the healthcare sphere and further support the development of the le sciences sector in the country.ldquoScotland has always punched above its weight when it comes to medical innovation right up to today. Itrsquos not just the Simpsons and Listers and people of the past, itrsquos the work thatrsquos coming out of the research just now, itrsquos amazing and BioQuarter has played and will continue to play a really critical role in that.By having a major hospital, research and business facilities in close proximity, BioQuarter helps secure advances in medical science and healthcare and to support the effort to commercialise promising technology.The commercialisation centre is home to ten spin outs including contract research specialist Aquila BioMedical and there is demand for space from other businesses.Research giant buys stake in BioQuarter-based businessAs a senior member of the estates department at Edinburgh university Ms Stamp led work on research facilities that helped underline the potential of the BioQuarter, before being appointed in August to lead on the expansion plan.The buildings she worked on in her estates role include the poundm Centre for Regenerative Medicine.Ms Stamp previously led on the regeneration of the Easter Bush Campus, where the Roslin Institute and the universityrsquos vet school stand on what were muddy fields.Having worked in senior positions in the public and private sectors Ms Stamp is confident that both will benefit from the Bio Quarter.Launched in , the BioQuarter is backed by NHS Lothian, Edinburgh university, the City of Edinburgh Council and Scottish Enterprise, which brings le science business development expertise.Around pound million has been invested in facilities on the site or those that are under development.Ms Stamp believes the right private sector players could allow the expansion of the development to proceed on a scale and at a speed that the public sector on its own might not be able to match.Before starting work at Edinburgh university in , Ms Stamp spent six interesting years at employee-owned John Lewis which she describes as an amazing company.ldquoYou are a partner from day one, there was a sense of family, a sense that you belonged to the business and that it was yours that gave you an amazing grounding.After completing her architectural training with John Lewis, Ms Stamp rose to a position which meant she played an important part in the development of major new stores such as one in the giant Bluewater complex in Kent.She was pleased to be chosen to lead work on the redesign of the John Lewis branch in the old St James Centre in Edinburgh,  miles from her native North Berwick.That meant having a big influence on a building that family members and friends had shopped in for years.Ms Stamp thinks the huge St James Quarter development which is under way in Edinburgh represents a welcome improvement on the tired St James Centre which it will replace.As changes in the retail world mean centres that only house shops could face a struggle the inclusion of hotels should help underpin the viability of the St James Quarter development.Her work on the BioQuarter expansion means she could play a key role in the development of another project that leaves a lasting impression on the city of Edinburgh.Ms Stamp wants to remain involved in regeneration work in future. As a senior figure in the building world she hopes to make an impact in other ways. These include helping to ensure the construction industry gives women a fairer deal.ldquoI think the construction industry is really failing in how it promotes females hellip I can interview contractors all day and sometimes not a single female walks through the door.QAWhat countries have you most enjoyed travelling to, for business or leisure, and why Hong Kong ndash as part of my architecture course back in the rsquos I was able to live and work in Hong Kong for a year. With the vibrancy, colours, noise, smells, Hong Kong was a city that never slept and I loved every second of it. To live and work in another country changes your outlook and I would encourage anyone who gets the chance to take it.When you were a child, what was your ideal job  Why did it appeal I wanted to be an architect from a very early age, influenced heavily by my dad who had his own architectural practise in Leith, Edinburgh. Although architecture is about the built environment it is more about people ndash buildings are designed, built and lived in by people. As a child I watched my dad bring peoples ideas to reality and make a real dference to the way they lived.What was your biggest break in business I started off my career in the John Lewis Partnership as an architect in the late rsquos. The retail industry was changing rapidly at the time because of the recession and John Lewis embraced this with an ambitious programme of building large stores across the UK delivered in partnership with contractors and developers. This opened an avenue of opportunity for a rookie architect to be involved with and eventually lead large construction projects so early on in my career and learn the business of construction from both the client and investors perspective.What was your worst moment in business When you lead a project for it to be a success you have put your heart and soul into it. So when projects get scrapped it can be quite devastating. Sadly, this happens often in construction industry as funding is not secured or needs change. I am not sure it is something you ever get used to.Who do you most admire and why The architect Zaha Hadid who sadly died in  ndash she was the first woman to win a RIBA Royal Gold Medal in her own right. As a student we studied no female architects and during my career there have only been a few prominent female role models in architecture and construction.

I came from a lived experience and wanted to do something about it.She has done stellar work since, with the business selling millions of boxes of high-quality tampons, pads and menstrual cups and using the profits generated to donate identical products to charities and food banks. The aim is not just to ensure that no woman has to suffer the indignity of stuffing their pants with loo roll ndash or the health risk of using a product for too long ndash but to raise awareness about how period poverty can affect peoplersquos lives.This week the organisation launched its latest campaign, stocking supermarket shelves with bogus brand UNsanitary to highlight how one in  women and girls are forced to use socks, newspapers and toilet roll to soak up their menstrual flow. ldquoUNsanitary pads is a fake brand, designed to shock, the company says. ldquoIt makes the crippling period poverty these girls and young women still face across the UK relevant and real.It could not be more timely. Thanks to the tenacity of Labour MSP Monica Lennon, Holyrood is in the throes of debating whether free period products should be a universal right for any Scottish resident who requires them. Though the Scottish Government already funds the provision of products in schools, colleges and universities ndash and provides financial backing for a range of charitiesrsquo poverty-eradication work ndash Ms Lennon wants to see that extended.In the introduction to a public consultation on the bill, she wrote that ldquoit is to our shame that menstruation is still discussed in hushed voices and that menstrual healthcare and hygiene is not embedded in our health and education systems. By making sanitary products freely available, she added, ldquoScotland can end the silence and stigma that surrounds menstruation and create ldquoa fairer and more equal society.Yet even though  per cent of those who responded to the consultation supported those aims, earlier this month Holyroodrsquos cross-party Local Government and Communities Committee rejected the bill. The SNP and Tory members voted it down on the basis of cost, with only the Green and Labour members giving it their backing.Of course it is only right and proper that every penny of public spending should be properly accounted for, and the disparity between the pound. million Ms Lennon reckons the scheme would cost to run and the Governmentrsquos own estimate of poundm is signicant.But in a country where every one of us can,we so choose, get a free prescription for dandruff shampoo, haemorrhoid cream or mouthwash, it was a shameful decision to make, not least because it gave the impression that sanitary pads and tampons are luxury items that women can somehow do without.Nothing could be further from the truth. As Girlguiding Scotlandrsquos Carolyn Fox-Mackay said last week, period products are ldquoessential products and no one should miss out on opportunities, face isolation or embarrassment simply because they canrsquot afford them. Putting in place a safety net for those who need it would not be profligacy, it would be the mark of a truly civilised society.Ministers are now due to vote on the bill at the end of this month, with a group of  SNP members urging their party to back it. Newly elected Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw, meanwhile, has indicated that he will support it. That does not mean it will necessarily pass, though, with some attitudes around menstruation, poverty and womenrsquos rights appearing depressingly entrenched.Indeed, there are some who believe period poverty is something women should just endure or, bizarrely, take some kind of strength from. Just last month the BBC radio presenter Liz Kershaw won herself as many backers as detractors when she responded to a campaign to put free products in English schools by saying her mother had ldquohad to use old rags which my grandma boiled-washed and she re-used.ldquoHow did she ever manage to get a scholarship to grammar school, go to university and become a headteacher without free tampons  she asked, aswe shouldnrsquot expect things to be better now than they were in the aftermath of the Second World War aswomen like her mother hadnrsquot spent decades earning the right for us all to have a bit more dignity in our lives.Then there are those who donrsquot believe period poverty is a thing, that because supermarkets sell own-brand products at bargain basement prices it is a lie for anyone to claim they cannot afford them. Yet as simple as it may be to dismiss other peoplersquos suffering in this way, the fact remains that even a few pennies is an insurmountable sum when there are no pennies left to give that when faced with buying cheap tampons for herself or a loaf of bread for her children a mother will always choose the latter.Celia Hodson summed this up during our interview when she said that for too many people le is ldquoso vulnerable. ldquoThere are people who are barely managing and living very fragile lives, she said. ldquoIf therersquos a blip it puts their budget onto a kne edge.She also praised the Scottish Government for recognising that vulnerability and ldquohaving a crack at trying to eradicate it. A year and a half later and it is clear that that crack has not been enough, though.

They eat these things buttoxins get in they can bioaccumulate inside the shellfish and when we eat the shellfish, they donrsquot get broken down by heat so cooking doesnrsquot get rid of them.Harmful algal bloomcan spread over a square kilometre of ocean or be concentrated in a tiny area of a sea loch, appearing for a few days, or a week, before currents move it on or it dies from lack of nutrients.The cause of the blooms are in debate but the rise in sea temperatures are recognised to be a contributory factor.Dr Whyte said: ldquoTherersquos a bit of controversy around that [ there are more instances of HAB]. Wersquove got more farms now around the world than ever before and our techniques are getting better and wersquore getting better at finding things in the water so that could be why we seem to find more of them occurring but we are aware they are spreading into areas they never have before.ldquoMost of the toxins are in dinoflaggelates that favour water thatrsquos stratied so when the water heats up and has a nice warm top layer, they live there quite happily. Because of global warming sea temperatures have been rising so we get these stratied layers lasting for longer, theyrsquore more persistent and widespread and they favour the dinoflaggelates who have longer to live up there and breed so they have more effect on the shellfish.The Predicting Risk and Impact of Harmful Events on the Aquaculture Sectorproject is now in its second year of three, and builds on the already established Harmful Algal Bloom and Biotoxin Monitoringreports run by SAMS that is used by Scottish shellfish farmers to monitor sea conditions.Shellfish farmers carry out rigorous testing on their stock to ensure any toxins are detected, using equipment on site and sending samples to be checked to a monitoring programme run by Food Standards Scotland. Via that service, SAMS check around  samples from active shellfish sites in Scotland weekly.The HAB forecast sends out information and alerts to farmers and Food Standards Scotland who will check the shellfish coming off those farmsthere is a bloom nearby. The report, which can be accessed online, also produces a bulletin for the community of Shetland shellfish farmers who requested a specic risk assessment notice that includes what phytoplanktons are present, wind current and sea surface temperatures.If the samples pass the limits, theyrsquoll go ahead for sale andnot, the shellfish farms will be closed down for two weeks to allow the toxins to die out.If shellfish are affected they ldquojust keep on eating whatrsquos coming through and recover and excrete the poisonous stuff so after a few weeks theyrsquore usually healthy, said Dr WhyteThe UK, Ireland, Spain and Portugal are working on the euro million PRIMROSE model which will alert countries to blooms in their seas and nearby. Sharing bulletins, expertise and technologies will lead to better monitoring and forecasting and prevention of stock losses.A portal will collect data from satellite analysis, samples and shellfish farmers as well as other sources to predict the blooms.If farmers were due to harvest when a bloom is near, they would test the product and may send it away for further testing, harvesting onlysafe. If there is any doubt, says Dr Whyte, farmers leave their stock in the water.Dr Whyte said: ldquoThe idea is to try and push forward the forecasts as far forward as we can.ldquoWe are using oceanographic models to try and predict when blooms would occur, why and how severe they might be."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen-exhibition-highlights-historical-women-fringes-society","story":"The charges brought against her included creating a love potion, breaking the wheels of a mill in revenge after the miller refused to give her any meal, and taking bones of the dead from the kirkyard at Dyce, washing them in water which she then used to clean a sick man before casting the bones into the River Don, causing the water to rumble asall the hills had fallen in.She was convicted and subsequently executed by burning - using six loads of firewood.The trial took place at a time when witchcraft paranoia was rampant in Aberdeenshire.

Work is expected to be completed later in the summer.A spokesman for Scottish Water said the aqueduct drops by . metres from the north end of Loch Katrine to the south of Milngavie.The bulk of the work being carried out is lsquostandard concrete and mortar repairs,rsquo he added.ldquoHowever, to stabilise exposed rock sections, the project team is using an unusual technique that involves drilling into the rock, inserting steel anchor bolts up to  metres long, attaching steel mesh reinforcements and then spraying concrete until structural integrity is established, he said.ldquoGiven that some of this work is more than half a mile along the aqueduct from entry chambers, electric buggies are being used to move equipment, materials and workers.David Wilkinson, Scottish Waterrsquos senior project manager, said his team of engineers is enjoying working on the project and has been impressed with the work our Victorian forefathers.He said: ldquoOur recent inspections have shown that the aqueduct is in remarkably good condition for its age. Itrsquos mainly constructed from tightly joined masonry blocks in an arched shape. Very little movement or even mortar deterioration is evident. The quality of the workmanship is very impressive.ldquoTo ensure that water can flow by gravity from Loch Katrine to Mugdock and Craigmaddie reservoirs in Milngavie, the aqueducts are laid at a gradient of  inches per miles. This equates to the aqueduct dropping one metre vertically for every  metres horizontally, which means it is virtually flat and drops only . metres during the entireof the old aqueduct. That would be dficult to achieve today with modern surveying equipment and laser levels. To have achieved this  years ago, in deep trenches or freshly blasted tunnel, is quite incredible.ldquoItrsquos also a great tribute to the people who designed and built it that the aqueduct is still so environmentally-friendly and delivering massive benefits to Scotland in the st century.He added: ldquoThis is a pretty unique project and is something of a labour of love for many of us on the team. The work is challenging, time consuming and often very detailed.ldquoHowever, to get up close and personal with such a key asset, with all of its remarkable history, is a great privilege for all of the team."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-afraid-real-power-brokers-behind-government","story":"The attempted bullying and subsequent resignation of Sajid Javid, the former Chancellor, demonstrate an increase in the power and political leverage now held by Mr Cummings. He has become the Thomas Cromwell to King Boriss reign and the Cabinet will increasingly be an acquiescent talking shop, wholly under his control and offering little or no resistance to his political direction as he manipulates the indolent Prime Ministers alleged vision to supplant it with directives of his own with no accountability.There is a high level of apprehension in Government circles at present regarding one of Mr Cummingsrsquos leading aides, Andrew Sabisky. Mr Sabisky may well represent the top of a substantial iceberg with regards Dominic Cummings and his inordinate influence over the decision making of the Prime Minister. The Labour Party has called for Mr Sabisky to resign following publication of his extreme views on eugenics, women and female genital mutilation, though the party in power appears to be ambivalent about his immoral and antediluvian views.Be under no illusion, Mr Sabisky and his fellow advisers are key people in government who are responsible for turning the philosophy of Mr Cummings into practice, including social policy. Like a medieval fiefdom, Parliament and Cabinet will be increasingly sidelined at the expense of democracy and transparency. We have a Prime Minister of questionable morality, a limited conscience and the work ethic of Homer Simpson. The real power broker in the UK is Dominic Cummings who dominates a supine but media-friendly Prime Minister and will exploit his many weaknesses to guide the country down his post-Brexit de- regulated but deeply flawed Utopia.Be afraid, be very afraid.Owen Kelly, Stirling.\"A STATE which dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands.... will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished\" . So what about a prime minister who fills his Cabinet with sycophants and yes-men  While Boris Johnsons Cabinet reshuffle clearly serves his greed for power it also shows a dangerous lack of foresight.Ann Marie Di Mambro, Glasgow G.THE nightmare on Downing Street continues. Whilst media attention was distracted by the PMs \"call and response\" game at the first reshuffled Cabinet meeting last week, Rishi Sunak, the new Chancellor, informed fellow ministers that all departments had to find five per cent savings so the money \"could be used on other priorities\". During the General Election campaign the PM appealed to the electorate not to be judged by his predecessors austerity measures, he did not approve of them. So how should these cuts be interpreted Its another lie of course, we should all know better by now than to question his promises. The future is further spending cuts, including to the Department of Healthand to the Home Officeso Boris Johnson can spend money on ... the NHS and the police.Paul Shaw, Dunblane.I READ with considerable interest the comments by journalists and political pundits on the departure of Sajid Javid as Chancellor as both a victory for No  and a consequential diminution of the role of the Treasury asof the public purse.Reference has also been made to the historic stand-offs between previous Prime Ministers and their Chancellors asthis was a necessary and indeed healthy part of the workings of the UK Government.The emerging view is that the consequence of this ldquoclipping the Treasuryrsquos wings will result in a weakening of the effectiveness of Central Government specically because the Treasury will not be able to put a brake on stop future ideas and developments.Although this message is loud and clear, I read little in the way of evidence demonstrating the historic effectiveness of the UK Treasury in the overall management and direction of the UK economy.The ability to stop ideas and initiatives because of their funding needs has, it could be argued, proved to be a major weakness in the UK Governmentrsquos ability to both anticipate trends and to be fleet of foot in generating innovative policy and spending solutions as well as the ability to create and mobilise whole government solutions to the wicked issues that bedevil our society.If the strengthening of the role of No  results in a new capability, a new capacity to develop and implement a clear long-term strategy for the worldrsquos fth largest economy beyond the current and somewhat embarrassingly limited mantra of  new hospitals HS , additional police officers and so on then all well and good.One can only hope.George Thorley, Carluke.ALASDAIR Gallowayis absolutely correct that at the  Scottish Parliament elections the SNP vote exceeded its total vote at the  \"tsunami\" election when it achieved what Mr Galloway rightly calls the \"impossible\" majority. In addition, when Mr Galloway refers to the historical fact that the  elections did not result in an independence referendum, may I remind himthat the  Scottish Parliament elections were held several weeks before the EU referendum, before Scottish voters knew that they were to be taken out of the EU against their will, and that the assurance given to us during the independence referendum that only by voting No could Scotland guarantee her place in Europe was worthless. Moreover, the SNPs  manesto acknowledged that there would not be a second vote on independence unless there was a change of circumstances such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will. Following that, the SNP won the majority of Scottish seats at Westminster at the  General Election, and last December Nicola Sturgeon put Indyref at the heart of the SNPs campaign, and won another \"tsunami\" election.Boris Johnson has nevertheless declared that there wont be a second vote on independence and like Mr Galloway I wonder as to \"what sort of electoral result would be enough\" in order that one be held. One thing is clear there is no use looking for democracy from the Scottish Tories new leader Jackson Carlaw, who is \"totally opposed\" to another vote evenopinion polls show voters in favour of one, evenvoters keep voting for the independence-supporting parties and even\"growing numbers\" of members in his own party support a second independence referendum.Mr Carlaw has slammed the door on putting Scotlands future into Scotlands hands, preferring to keep Scotlands future in the hands of Mr Johnson despite Scotland decisively slamming the door on the Prime Minister only two months ago.Ruth Marr, Stirling.IN his desire to persuade Westminster to agree to Indyref , Alasdair Galloway asks ldquowhere do we go next \". Apart from disassociating myself from being any part of his ldquowe, as sovereignty rests with the people, rather than seats in Holyrood, permit me to respond to him by wheeling out my view that it is the people he has to persuade before the Scottish elections in , and the only true reflection of his success or failure in that will be the total number of votes cast for the parties standing respectively for or against Indyref. I am unable to see the relevance to any of this in his reference to the votes cast only by Conservatives in the EU referendum.Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.JACKSON Carlaw needs to mind his language.In January of this year he said: \"Ive spent the last  months taking on Nicola Sturgeon. Im asking our party to let me spend the next  months taking her down.\"At the launch of his leadership campaign one of his four objectives was \"Beat the SNP\". More recently he has declared that \"the SNP is an evangelical, faith-based cult\".Not only has Mr Carlaw managed to be offensive to women, people who have a religious faith and SNP members and voters, he has set a tone which is misogynistic, adversarial and deeply disrespectful.The political discourse needs to be better than this. Political discourse has been described as \"the formal exchange of reasoned views as to which of several alternative courses of action should be taken to solve a societal problem\".Reasoned views are exactly what we need from politicians of all parties, andMr Carlaw considers himself a leader then lets hear some positive suggestions for what it is possible to deliver rather than deficit-based rhetoric. To simply hurl insults with macho bluster gets us nowhere and suggests that Mr Carlaw is not up to the job.Carol Vanzetta, East Kilbride.ROBERT IG Scottexplains why \"the people of Scotland voted against the SNP\" in the  referendum. I lived and voted in west Fe in  and the SNP did not feature on the ballot paper I received. Perhaps they had dferent ballot papers in north-east Fe. My decision to vote Yes for independence had nothing to do with the SNP and everything to do with the the surge in support for Ukip south of the Border. I cannot understand why so many Scots seem to swallow the Unionist myth that Scottish independence would mean perpetual rule by the SNP in stark contrast to my belief that the SNP would appeal to very few after independence.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.AT the Glasgow Labour leadership hustings , Rebecca Long-Bailey demonstrated how little she understands the constitutions dominant role in Scottish politics.

However, Steve’s natural talent and drive quickly meant that they were expanding and moved into Inverurie.Not long after the move Steve and Jim amicably parted ways leaving Steve as the sole proprietor of IK. Branching out and running the business on his own, Steve was never one to shy away from risks.As well as his ability to grab an opportunity with both hands, a critical aspect of Steve, and therefore, IK Motor’s success, is his commitment to going the extra mile for the customer.Steve commented: “Ultimately, it’s all about giving the customer a good deal, and letting them know that they can always count on us to come through for them. Our interest in the customer doesn’t end when they purchase a vehicle, we make sure they get good service afterwards.” This commitment to customers extends to the wider community at large, with Steve always making the effort to give back and ensure that Inverurie shares in IK’s success. He said: “In Inverurie there is a particularly strong sense of community. Even though it’s expanded considerably, that sense of cohesion is still there, and we love to be a part of that.“Every year we try and do what we can to give something back.

Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country.

One by one, they planted the rough wooden memorials in the grass –  in all – each one marking a le lost to drugs. As they did so, they reflected on the good times, and lamented the waste.The last to plant his cross was Steven Currie. Steven’s older brother Peter McGrattan – known to most as Big Ped – was obsessed by music. “He was into punk when he was a boy, then U, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses, Oasis,” says Steven, who has the word “Brother” tattooed on his arm. “He was the man for the music, and you would follow suit because you looked up to him.” Steven would sit on the floor while Peter played DJ. “I’d tap tap my feet and think: ‘That’s quite good, that.’ His taste was superb. He could have been one of those guys that spotted bands.”But Big Ped carried a bit of weight and it affected his self-esteem. He trod that well-worn path from alcohol through soft drugs, heroin and crack cocaine, on to the grave. He died of a Valium overdose, after eight years clean, in August , dying in their mother’s house. “The paramedic came in and said: ‘He’s gone,’” Steven says. “I sat with him on the floor and cuddled him until they came and took him away.” Gone, but still loved still remembered.We are in the grip of a drugs deaths emergency here in Scotland, as everybody knows. Our drugs death rate is the worst in Europe. The toll for  was , – the highest it has ever been. It will come as little surprisethis year’s is higher still. The crosses are a reminder that each of the , was an inidual robbed of their future.En masse, they capture the scale of the problem. Spread out in rows like war graves, they say: “Here is a generation being wiped out, while those at the top play politics.” Is this too harsh  Maybe. Yet even as Steven placed his cross, the UK and Scottish governments were squabbling over rival drugs summits to be held in Glasgow a day apart. “My drugs summit is better than your drugs summit,” they blustered like children.Of course, politicians on both sides can justy their position. The UK government will say it announced its conference first. “But without consulting us, and without including those with lived experience,” the Scottish Government will counter. If either party does not understand how pathetic it sounds – how pathetic it is – for two governments who share responsibility for drugs policy to be unwilling to cut the crap and share a table, I suggest they get out of politics for a while and look at this from beyond the bubble. I suggest they spend some time in those communities where people are losing their lives for want of inter-agency collaboration and a coherent policy.This is not to suggest the Scottish Government is doing nothing. Last year – under pressure, and having previously cut frontline services – it set up the Drugs Deaths Task Force. In the recent budget it announced an extra £.m to be spent on “delivering innovative projects, testing new approaches and developing a national pathway for opiate substitute therapy”.The Scottish Government conference will also provide training in the use of Naloxone, which reverses the effect of drugs overdoses, and a demonstration model of a drugs consumption room. It insists what takes place there will “inform” its contribution to the UK summit the next day. And yet the mutual blame game neither side appears able to stop does not augur well.So often we hear about successful policy where, particularly in Portugal where drugs have been decriminalised, users have been de-stigmatised and those who consume can choose between harm reduction and rehab.But the key to Portugal’s success was not merely the approach itself, but the political consensus that formed around it and an unshakeable commitment to that approach through successive governments.Here in the UK, we are still treating drugs policy like a political football a forum for the airing of grievances a battleground for ideological dferences. This was happening long before the general election, but it is worse now the Tories have a thumping majority.The destructive relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Government – and more specically between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson – is spilling into other areas too, most notably the COP climate conference which will take place in Glasgow in November.This conference is supposed to build the coalition necessary to break the deadlock on international climate action – and therefore requires UK-wide co-operation and a gt for diplomacy.Already, however, it has been reduced to oneupmanship. Despite being advised otherwise, Johnson has refused to give Sturgeon any formal role in proceedings. And there have been disputes over the venue itself. With the conference set to be held in the Scottish Events Campus on the north of the river, the Scottish Government booked out the Science Centre on the south. But now the UK government says it needs both sites and has accused the Scottish Government of trying to undermine its plans. To make matters worse, the Prime Minister is said to have referred to Sturgeon as “that wee Jimmy Krankie woman” to which Sturgeon responded “ Boris Johnson wants to make personal insults against me, I’m a big enough girl to make personal insults back”. All highly constructive.I think most of us accept Johnson would try the patience of a saint. As last week’s reshuffle demonstrated, he – or rather Dominic Cummings – is hell-bent on exercising control. Claire Perry claims he sacked her as the president of the COP and replaced her with former international development secretary Alok Sharma because Whitehall couldn’t cope with an independent conference. Sharma is said to have a questionable record on environment issues.Given all this, it must be tempting to answer criticism by pointing out that “Johnson started this” and that he is a twat of the highest order. But that gets us nowhere. Meanwhile, the planet burns.Aware, presumably, that tit-for-tat fighting is destructive and childish, Sturgeon has called for a reset in relations. But for that to happen, the UK government will not only have to be willing to co-operate on key issues, the Scottish Government will have to stop constantly passing the buck southwards.The constitutional debate is not going to disappear. Both governments will be arguing over the legitimacy of a second independence referendum for some time. But they need to be able to set that argument aside when it comes to shared crises such as drugs deaths and climate change.Only by attempting to find common ground can progress be made. If that requires pride to be swallowed, and teeth to be gritted, then so be it. There are too many crosses already in Springburn too many species already extinct.

We must surely, he added, be witnessing a historical record – a government in crisis after just two months in power.Meanwhile, Labour-supporting commentators lined up to explain the replacement of Javid with, as one columnist described him, the “alarmingly obedient” Rishi Sunak.I’m bound to say that for a man mired in crisis, Johnson appears remarkably relaxed. When he and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, told Javid they wanted his team cleared out and replaced by a new staff of advisers working across both  and  Downing Street, they must have know there was a chance – a good one, at that – that the chancellor wouldn’t wear it. His decision to walk cannot have come as a shock.McDonnell’s description of a government in crisis is, I’m afraid, inaccurate. Rather, what we’re seeing is a Prime Minister fully in control. There is no crisis.In Javid’s eager beaver replacement, Johnson has precisely what he wanted: a compliant chancellor who will do what he desires.Quite why Sunak’s loyalty should be seen as “alarming”, I’m not sure. There is nothing in the rule book of politics that says the sign of a good chancellor is a willingness to defy the prime minister. Was Tony Blair’s Labour government improved by the fact chancellor Gordon Brown spent his every waking moment seething with resentment over his rival’s supremacy  No, it wasn’t, was it  In fact, briefing and counter-briefing by Number  and Treasury sources meant the fractured relationship between prime minister and chancellor frequently got in the way of smooth government. When both men would rather have seen their policy agenda make headlines, their bitter relationship became the focus of media attention.When, finally, Brown realised his ambition of becoming prime minister, he could not change his ways. A man born to plot, Brown soon began undermining his chancellor, Alistair Darling, destroying a professional and personal relationship that had endured for years.David Cameron and George Osborne entered government in  having learned from their predecessors. Relations between Downing Street and the Treasury were good for the first time in a long time.Cameron and Osborne were a team and they always understood the pecking order. Each got what he needed from the relationship.But Johnson has no such partner. The Prime Minister has no political soulmate.This being so, what, exactly is the problem with Johnson wishing to take a firm grip of the Treasury  It is, I think, the sort of thing that might look to voters like strong leadership. Few, I’d wager, now lament the passing of the Javid era.Among Johnson’s immediate priorities is solidying the Conservative vote in areas of England which once ed Labour MPs. The Prime Minister will want to deliver for areas in the Midlands and the North of England which went Tory for the first time in generations. If he does not make good on his promises of regeneration and investment then the PM risks watching those voters drt back to Labour.What Johnson needs, right now, is a chancellor who is completely on board with this agenda. But there is something  beyond the Prime Minister’s desire for a compliant chancellor at play, here. Johnson has just sent a message to every member of his parliamentary party that the rules of the game have changed. His demand is complete loyalty, nothing less.From what McDonnell describes as a crisis will, I think, spring a period of uncommon stability in government. Last year, Johnson won the parliamentary majority he craved. Now, he has stamped his authority on his party in no uncertain terms.This same message came across loudly and clearly in Johnson’s dismissal from his cabinet of former leadership contenders Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey. Leadsom is a popular figure among members of the Tory Party’s Eurosceptic right wing. Johnson’s calculation is that he need not concern himself with the feelings of those members. Javid comes out of the last few days rather well, I think. No chancellor can complain about a demand for loyalty but the order to dismiss his team of advisers was a step too far, one provocation too many.That Javid said no to this suggests he has something about him, after all.In a statement following his resignation, the former chancellor reiterated his support for Johnson. I wonder how long this will last.It is undoubtedly the case that when political parties lose discipline, they lose elections. Look at the SNP. For decades, they did nothing but tear each other apart over the best way in which independence might be achieved. Bitter recrimination was part and parcel of SNP membership. And then Alex Salmond ed as party leader for a second stint and he laid down the bloody law to his colleagues. There was to be no briefing about colleagues, no criticism of government policy, and no public disagreement over any of the party’s positions.What followed was as period of unity in the SNP ranks that continues – the occasional domestic disturbance, aside – to this day.I’m not sure Johnson is behaving especially dferently to the way Salmond did. Doubtless, opposition parties will taunt Chancellor Rishi Sunak when he next rises to speak in the House of Commons. They will leave him in no doubt that they consider him a poodle.But each and every one of Boris Johnson’s opponents will privately admire the way he strengthened his grip on the Tory Party last week.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

After a spirited campaign by his opponent Michelle Ballantyne, Carlaw in the end won comfortably with a % to % share of the members’ votes cast. The party should be thankful to Ballantyne for ensuring there was a contest, not least for allowing Carlaw to now say with authority he has an unequivocal mandate to run the party. She also gave voice to concerns that have been building up over recent years about party management. Carlaw will surely want to address these rather than exacerbate them. While the candidates did their best to present themselves as dferent and thus offer a genuine choice, the reality is they had far more in common than what ided them. For the party this is a good thing as members now have to unite behind Carlaw’s leadership and turn their attention to the most important challenge facing them – defeating the SNP in the  elections.Their first goal will be to prevent the SNP having an overall majority like that won by Alex Salmond in , but then lost by Nicola Sturgeon in . Despite the appalling performance of our public services under the management of the SNP government, recent polling suggests it could yet win such a huge mandate. While possible I think it unlikely, for once the electorate begins to consider the SNP’s record in detail its failure must begin to pay idends for the opposition. Also fundamental to the debate is how the dominance of Brexit will recede, allowing more oxygen to be given to the scrutinising the performance of SNP ministers.The second goal must then be to lay the ground for a new administration that locks the SNP out of government evenSturgeon wins the most seats. An alternative minority administration that enjoys a comfort and supply arrangement would be the most likely route – as neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats will want to even hint at a coalition, never mind formalise one. In an effort to kill-off such a prospect the SNP will seek to demonise any party offering to work with dreaded Tories – or “Tory Scum” as the infamous banner that graces nationalist marches brands over half a million Scottish voters. In response the argument has to be put that it was the Tories who provided a comfort and supply arrangement to Salmond and Sturgeon between -. If the Tories were good enough for the SNP then, why should it not be good enough for Carlaw to do the same with other partiesit’s best for the for the country It is impossible to say what role the Labour Party will play in all of these developments too much depends on how its UK leadership election works out, but there are other encouraging signs that offer hope to unionists. Yesterday Scottish Business UK, the pro-Union business group backed by hundreds of Scottish businesses and including many household names, published a new paper advocating a more positive and assertive approach by the UK government. Included in the paper Strengthening the Union: A Framework for Business Success were proposals for a UK Department of the Union which would have grant-aiding powers to assist directly initiatives that will help the UK’s cohesiveness. These might be community based or infrastructure projects – but they would clearly demonstrate and say on the tin they have been delivered by the UK.Other ideas included an Office for Budget Responsibility for the Union that would bring more transparency to encourage both accountability and value for money in public spending. Interestingly it is argued the new OBR could become a force for helping achieve UK-wide spending commitments in Scotland as well challenging them. The paper also considered issues from taxation to fisheries, cultural exchange within the UKto migration. Some may fly, others probably will not, but the fact that a business group is bringing forward positive ideas that can add value to being in the UK illustrates how the UK’s status quo is never set in stone.Indeedthere is one dference why the UK’s advocates won the independence referendum of  but the Europhiles lost that of  is the UK is evolving and decentralising by devolving power out to nations and cities – whereas the EU is taking more and more power for itself. Other unionist organisations are also stirring Scotland in Union, the largest campaign group defending the Union launched a Valentine video message last week and another offering ten reasons Scotland is stronger in the UK. That might not seem especially unusualbut the adoption of a positive rather than negative tone represents a change in approach away from the project fear of the past and, I believe, will begin to pay idends. Likewise the meetings being organised around the country by the unionist lobbying group Scotland Matters demonstrates the level of activism outside party circles is growing. True, such events are not at the levels of Yes activism, but that’s not the appropriate comparison, the point is no such activities were even being considered by unionists before the last referendum in . This time Unionists of all parties or none are mobilising in advance of the  elections to head off nationalism before any referendum.Later this weekend in Newcastle-upon-Tyne the discussion forum “These Islands” holds a two day conference to explores issues of culture and identity that are rarely given enough thought by unionists.The growth of such activities points to a more confident and less complacent approach from unionists be they large or small “U”. It shows a willingness to do grown-up politics, to have adult and reasoned debate away from the obscenities and hatred spouted at marches, worn on T-shirts and sprayed across social media that too many nationalists have descended into.All of Scotland’s pro-British parties can tap into this new wave of unionist optimism – and then maybe learn to work together.Brian Monteith is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"mps who make the most from side jobs as downing st weighs up bbc speech ban","story":"Downing Streets multi-frontal effort to cut the BBC down to size,#revealed in the#Sunday Times, includes a plan to ban presenters from \"cashing in\" with external work such as speeches.Kamal Ahmed, the BBCs director of news, was found to have earned £, from addressing a conference and forced to repay the money.\"It’s an outrage that people who make their profile at public expense should seek to give themselves further financial rewards and personal gain,\" the source said. \"They’re basically making their names on the taxpayer and then cashing in.

Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH1402NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 14th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"council apologise after grave mistake","story":"BELFAST City Council has had to apologise to a recently bereaved family after ly informing them that a stranger was buried in their loved one’s grave.Last week, Council officials told the West Belfast family they could not bury their relative alongside her mother as there was an additional person interred in the burial plot.A grieving family member spoke of her family’s trauma when, as they prepared for her sister-in-law’s funeral last week, Belfast City Council insisted that another woman had been buried in the grave since .“My brother was insistent that this was a new plot, only opened in  when his mother-in-law died but the ‘spokesperson’ in City Hall was also insistent that they were right and their records are never wrong,” she explained.“After nearly an hour of stress and annoyance my brother had a brainwave that the new plot his mother-in-law was in didn’t exist in .“The graves at the new plots at the very top of City Cemetery didn’t date back that far.”Following an investigation it was revealed that Belfast City Council had mistaken the family grave for another after mixing up the plots.“My poor, grieving brother who had lost his we just hours before was left totally wrung out and traumatised – I was the same,” the bereaved woman said.“No apology from City Hall whatsoever just a bit of a ‘d’oh’ moment and ‘oh human error’ – not good enough!“Whoever is inputting these statistics and grave co-ordinates needs to be checked and rechecked to make sure this type of incident doesn’t happen again.“City Hall need to remember they are dealing with bereaved people and desperately need to show a bit more compassion when dealing with these types of things.”The woman accused Belfast City Council of passing “the buck on to the ordinary, bereaved families”.“The administrative side of Belfast City Hall reeks of laziness, incompetency and pure lack of compassion and I expect some sort of reply”.This is the second time Belfast City Council has had to apologise to a bereaved family in as many weeks.Last week, the Andersonstown News reported how council officials apologised after sending a letter to a deceased woman asking her to repair her own headstone.Commenting on its latest blunder, a Belfast City Councilspokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for any distress caused to the family. When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

We need to stop disregarding the importance of human rights and we need to think about how we tackle sectarianism.”Mr Nesbitt said one of the most effective ways to tackle sectarianism would be the creation of a single education system.“If you are mixing children from the ages of three or four every day you are giving them an inoculation against sectarianism.“Andwe can tackle sectarianism we can tackle one of the most toxic legacies of our Troubles.”There is \"a long legacy of sectarian decision making\" in Northern Ireland\" - Dr Robbie McVeigh, who is launching his new research report, Sectarianism: The Key Facts, at Stormont today. He argues for the effective equality proofing of decisions going forwards. pic UhoPCwzAE— EqualityCoalitionFebruary , The -page report was penned by independent researcher Dr Robbie McVeigh.Dr McVeigh said there was a need to consider the problem in the context of Northern Ireland’s changing demographic landscape.He said the region was no longer characterised by a Protestant majority and Catholic minority and was instead a place of “three minorities” – Protestant, Catholic and increasing number who identy as neither.He said disparities between Protestants and Catholics still existed in many areas across the public sector – expressing particular concern about stalled efforts to make the PSNI more representative of the community it serves.He urged authorities in Northern Ireland to learn from an initiative undertaken by former prime minister Theresa May when she ordered an audit of all government departments to establish areas where racial disparities existed.Dr McVeigh said departments were then challenged to either explain the disparities or take action to address them. vw,vw,px, px\"Declan Kearney said sectarianism was the ‘elephant in the room’ across society in the region Stormont Junior Minister Declan Kearney also addressed the event. He insisted the executive was committed to tackling the “poison” of sectarianism.“Sectarianism remains endemic within northern society and in my view it is at the very crux of all our political, social and community isions,” he said.“Sectarianism isn’t some kind of abstract concept – it is omnipresent.“In many ways, it is our elephant in the room.”PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadEasyJet flight s to Belfast airport after passengers #smell gas#I was ‘burned’ from UUP leader’s job by unionist sectarianism – Nesbitt#Miracle no one was hurt# as Storm Dennis damages Dundonald shopsNorthern Ireland legend Harry Gregg to be laid to rest on FridayMayhem as Storm Dennis rips Dundonald shop fronts apart,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many of the pupils at Ballougry PS have a family link to the school and children come from as far afield as Eglinton and Donemana to be educated there.We have children whose parents, grandparents and even great grandparents have been at the school.The parents have such fond memories of their time here that they want their children to enjoy the same type of education, no matter where they are living.Mr OKane believes that attending a small primary school equips children well for the transition to secondary school.In a small school setting you have to get on well with everyone and the children thrive on it.In bigger schools you can jump around friendship groupsthings arent working out, but here you just have to work it out.We were very happy with out recent transfer test results and our children will be moving on to every post primary school in the city.”Mr OKane concluded: The feedback that we always get is that the children really do represent us well.Among the schools best known past pupils is renowned actress, Amanda Burton, well known for her television roles, including Heather Black in the Channel  soap opera Brookside, Beth Glover in Peak Practice, Sam Ryan in the BBC crime drama series Silent Witness, Clare Blake in The Commander and Karen Fisher in Waterloo Road.Her father was a headmaster at the school. googletag.cmd.push Photos: Tom Heaney   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At a meeting of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s Health and Community Committee, Derry councillors said it is adding to the “reputational damage” of the care home. In November , the centre reopened to new admissions following a string of unsatisfactory inspections dating back to May. The privately owned centre based on the Culmore Road is an -bed facility which cares for people with dementia, learning disabilities and mental disorders. It was under enforcement after the health regulator, RQIA, took court action in August. googletag.cmd.push An investigation by health watchdog RQIA in May of last year identied “serious concerns” in relation to the quality of management and governance arrangements in the home, health and welfare of patients, in particular the record keeping, and the competency and capability of registered nursing staff. RQIA obtained a court order in August to block new admissions after it emerged the Western Trust was still referring patients to the home. During that time a respite unit for adults with learning disabilities, also based at Owen Mor, remained closed because it was registered as a single nursing home. That adversely affected both users and their families. googletag.cmd.push Owen Mor had been invited to attend a council meeting in January to address local councillors concerns but said it turned that down “owing to Owen Mor work commitments”. Representatives were instead invited to the care centre to discuss matters. The reason provided was described as “unsettling” by councillors who then extended another invitation to the registered accountable person at the home, Dr Una McDonald, at a date of her choosing. At Thursday’s meeting, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney asked for an update. A council official informed him that a response was provided on February  noting councillors’ views and comments, and the care centre made clear it would “not be in a position to accept any invitation in the near future.” But councillors were again given the option to meet at Owen Mor. ‘Disappointing’ In response, Cllr Tierney said: “It appears that Owen Mor is again refusing point blank to come before council to address concerns that have been ongoing for months.” He added that the meeting should not happen behind closed doors but in a public forum and believed another letter would be a “waste of time”. Independent Cllr Gary Donnelly said Owen’s Mor’s refusal to attend has inflicted further “reputational damage” on the organisation as it should be eager to “defend its position”. “It’s obvious they’re not going to come, asking a dozen councillors to come to a care home, I don’t think that’s appropriate. That’s leading to more concerns.” Alderman Maurice Devenney of the DUP said it was “disappointing” that senior management at the home haven’t taken up the invitation. If they don’t answer concerns, “how are we going to know it won’t happen again ” he asked. Addressing the meeting again, Cllr Tierney said it was important to note that some families have had no issues at Owen Mor, and it’s important to keep an open mind, but he questioned why an organisation “receiving public funds won’t come to council”. Alliance Cllr Rachael Ferguson enquired whether a meeting at Owen Mor could be minutedthat was the only option open to representatives. “It’s quite evident they don’t see themselves answerable to council,” Independent Cllr Paul Gallagher said. He proposed inviting Commissioner for Older People in NI, Eddie Lynch, before the committee to hear their concerns which in turn “might make Owen Mor take heed”. That proposal was seconded by Cllr Donnelly and supported by other members and the invitation to Owen Mor was left on the table.

Three choirs are appearing - the Voices of the Foyle, the Pink Ladies, and Thyme to Sing. The Ringabelles will there too with their dynamic harmonies. The Legenderry singer-songwriter Roy Arbuckle readily agreed to perform as did one of Derry’s finest female vocalists, Anne Tracey. googletag.cmd.push The beautully talented fiddle player and harpist Tracey McRory with singer, guitarist and composer Richard Laird will join this all-star cast. As will the Singing Butcher himself, Mark Mc Cafferty alongside his daughter, Ella. The now poignant Facebook footageof Mark dancing and singing with Maisie in Hegarty’s butchers shop on William Street has already gone viral.  The evening, kindly supported by mayor, Councillor Michaela Boyle, will be jointly compered by Joanna Boyd, and Radio Foyle’s Mark Patterson who both knew Maisie so well. Tracey McRory has composed a special piece “My Maisie“ in tribute to the “wee woman” Maisie may have been “wee” in stature but she had such a big, big warm heart. It was Maisie’s generosity of spirit and her love of banter and craic that drew people to her wherever she went. googletag.cmd.push And for sure Maisie’s le had not always been easy. She suffered tremendous losses during her letime, she was pre-deceased by her husband Walter, her two sons Gordon and Walter and her daughter, Avril. The burden of such loss might have crushed many’s a one. Maisie kept on smiling while also being able to share her grief when she felt it was the right time. And then she had cancer to deal with. That’s why she got in touch with the Pink Ladies who speak so warmly of her “We have the honour of calling Maisie Crawford a member of our Pink Family. She was Pink and Proud!! She enjoyed our choir, our social events and importantly our campaigns for better for services for cancer sufferers. Maisie supported our campaign for a Northwest Cancer Centre. “The then newly appointed Health Minister Edwin Poots listened intently to her pleawhen she met him in Stormont, so much so that he visited the site within days and overturned the decision made by his predecessor. The North West Cancer Centre was secured.” BEM honour Maisie was very active in community development at Nelson Drive and would often say that she developed her sense of community and her community work values growing up with her Catholic and Protestant neighbours around her in Alexander Place off the Foyle Road. Everybody was welcome at her door and at her hearth. She moved around the city so freely because she truly believed that it was her city, whatever the rest of us might choose to call it. Maisie loved the Royal family. She described herself as a Royalist. But she never sought to attack and belittle anyone who did not share her love for the Royal family. And she was so delighted when she was awarded the British Empire Medal , the British Empire Medal for services in the community. Her delight lted the hearts of all those around her, whatever their background. And of course she was a singer, taking great joy out of “throwing a song out of her” whether in Bennigans, Tinney’s or in her own Nelson Drive home where she faced her death with such a lovely peacefulness. “I’ve squared up with the Boss” she told me. She had Reverend David Latimer singing to her when he came to visit during her last few days on this earth. And as she turned towards her own passing, she loved the throng of family and friends who visited her from near and from far. We both mourned and celebrated a remarkable woman. Tickets for this special evening are pound and can be bought from the Crawford Family, from the Pink Ladiesfrom Caw-Nelson Drive Action Groupand at the Holywell Building, Bishop Street  There will be a raffle and an auction on the night and proceeds are in aid of Ward , where Maisie was a patient and in support of other charities Maisie involved herself in.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

This year, there’s an incredible line-up for you to celebrate International Womens Day - on the bill there’sThe Henry Girls, Blackbird  Crow, Reevah,Blood,Great White Lies andTara Giwith comperes for the evening Madonna Kebab and Thran Leeann, with the night ening with some tunes fromThe Stray Kitten.All that for pound in Sandino’s on Saturday, March .But, before that, on Saturday next, February , in the Gasyard, Blood’s Noella Hutton will be launching her new album.Noella doesn’t need an introduction, but for those of you who have never been outside she has had some of the best adventures of any of Derry’s musicians. “My first experiences of live music were of my sister, Jeanette, singing around the house,” she says, being inspired herself to moving to London to pursue her career, like many other musicians from Derry.She was signed to music superpower Universal Records in the late s, went to America, recorded her first album in the Record Plant in Sausalito, Calornia, where Rumours by Fleetwood Mac was made and took to the daily grind of constant gigging of being a working musician. Her follow-up album was made in Santa Monica and she came back to Derry in . She has consistently been writing and she promises anewalbum isn’t too far away. Really, really close actually. Solo album number three, is out on the nd.Have ye totally abandoned Jeanette or what’s the craic  googletag.cmd.push “I hate her phahahaha, naw, we still do the odd Blood gig. Theres just nowhere interested in doing original gigs. BennIgans is probably the only place that does. Wherever my album takes me Blood will go too. Jeanette is my best friend, my big sister, my greatest influence in every way, and we havethe same dark sense of humour. phahahaha very important!”Following your Facebook page, is there anyone you haven’t met  “To me, these people were powerful from a distance. Get them up close and sit with them theyre all just ordinary and winging it like the rest of us. Some of the loveliest folk I met where Sarah McLaughlin and Boy George. Theres a few more and a few that were very disappointing. Ill leave the details for another time.” googletag.cmd.push Tell us about recording the album… “Ive known Justin Black for  yearss. Hes been one of the only people besides ourJeanette that really cared and pushed me out of my depression.He has been annoying me for years to do an album for me. I can safely say hes one of the most talented,selfless... annoying... and extremely loyal friends Ive ever had. We have much to do.”This would be the time and place to mention that there won’t be a physical version of the album. If you were born before Nirvana that means there won’t be any vinyl or CDs, in fact Noella has said she hates Cds… me too. These are the times we live in and we might as well get used to it. I’m all for Noella’s approach. Are ye nervous putting it out by yourself  “I wouldnt want it any other way.Record companies are saturated with artists.Theyre just big banks who make most of the money so I would rather tread slowly and just enjoy the whole process and journey with the folk I trust to help me.” It’s a dferent music world from the s, how’d ye adapt “Its a great time to be a singer-songwriter recording our own songs. The internet has opened up immense possibilities. It’s very hard work. But having the right tools and in the hands of the best people anything is possible!”.Fascinating secret fact revealed…. Jeanette and NoellaHuttonsang in choirs and competed in feiseanna and have been named as an inspiration by most musicians I chat to.Another fascinating fact is that Noella is George Hutton’s big cousin and he has said “Noella and Jeanette are my cousins, but they’ve been a big inspiration of mine growing up. Two fearless performers with two beautul raw and passionate voices, writing songs from their very core, I absolutely love them.”Keep up to date here, www.facebook thefirstnoellaand get the album “Love  Liars” releasedon Saturday from Noella’s band page throughBandcamp.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs. She said this not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town.Cllr Mason said that housing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site.She added: ldquoThe bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road. The new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that Ms Mallon will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.He said: ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch, but the wider South Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 New Queens.jpg","title":"New queens of Ulster  ","story":"ST Maryrsquos High School, Downpatrick, lted the prestigious Erne Cup for the first time at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena, Cookstown, last Wednesday afternoon with a blistering display of attacking football.Victory was no more than the local girls deserved when they gained revenge for last seasonrsquos heartbreaking cup final defeat to the same opposition.St Maryrsquos started the game strongly and turned their possession into scores with an early goal from Saulrsquos Cara Doran settling the nerves.The Enniskillen girls were simply not allowed to play their vaunted expansive game and Katie Convie raced in almost immediately to make it - to - when she capitalised on a poor kick-out.St Fanchearsquos had no intention of giving up their title without a fight and replied with three consecutive points.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

Even the unexpected and unlikely can be discussed. It’s called preparation.In September , when unionism was focused on the centenary of the Ulster Covenant, I noted in a column that it also needed to be thinking ahead to the centenary of Northern Ireland in . My argument was that the talents of pro-Union academics, historians, economists, pollsters, PR experts, representatives from party-political unionism and loyalism, along with influencers across the entire pro-Union community , should be harnessed and tasked to prepare for both  and the succeeding decades. Make the case for the Union. Make the case for NI unionism. Establish a coherent, thought-through strategy for expanding the pro-Union vote. So, I was interested in Arlene Foster’s comments in a piece for Saturday’s News Letter: ‘We should not be complacent in defending and promoting the overwhelming benefits of being part of the UK. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the best defence against those who wish to take us out of the UK is to create a socially thriving and economically prosperous Northern Ireland. A Northern Ireland where everyone feels at home and where everyone has a genuine and active stake in determining the future.’Arlene Foster must make sure the Next Generation Unionism project is not solely DUP-led \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...She continued: ‘Last year the DUP began work on developing a Next Generation Unionism approach. This work continues and we must seek to be pro-active in developing our case and building the broadest possible support ... The road will not always be easy. There will be challenges. However this is how we will protect the interests of unionism and secure Northern Ireland’s place for the next  years. We all have a role to play in this process and I look forward to getting started.’I welcome Arlene’s approach, although I would enter one caveat: this must not just be a DUP-led project. The entire pro-Union community must be embraced and involved. Those who support the Union already and many others who could be persuaded to support it in a possible border poll cannot be left to one side during the debate. All voices and shades of opinion need to be heard from the outset and must be represented in whatever form the overarching strategy and policies take.Unionism isn’t built on a single opinion. Once you move beyond a preference for retaining the constitutional status quo you will discover that there are all sorts of nuances and dferences of opinion in play. All of them must be recognised, addressed and then accommodated as far as is possible or practical.There is another issue which must be addressed and it’s one that I have written about fairly recently in this column. There remains a tendency within unionismto blame just about everyone  for whatever present crisis we find ourselves in and, in my letime, I have heard all shades of unionism use ‘crisis’ on a very regular basis. It’s the fault of successive UK governments. It’s the fault of a particular secretary of state. It’s the fault of the media. It’s the fault of the Irish government. It’s the fault of Brussels. It’s the fault of every other party. It’s the fault of ‘peaceniks.’ It’s the fault of the wishy-washy. It’s the fault of the PSNI. And sometimes, when all  fails, it’s the fault of other unionists.So, let me rephrase the questions I asked a few weeks ago. Why does it seem to be in the interests of successive UK governments to undermine unionism why do so many within the UK’s political media establishment seem so willing to listen to the nationalist republican narrative why does the NIO seem to find it easier to side with its Irish counterparts than with NI unionism why do UK prime ministers find it so hard to stand – unambiguously –shoulder to shoulder with unionism and why does unionism find it so dficult to attract key sympathy and support from supposed friends at key moments  Personally, I also think that NI unionism needs to think beyond the economic argumentwhen it comes to making its case. At times we make it sound like the subvention is all that really matters: which probably explains why “You couldn’t afford us,” is one of the most common responses to the prospect of a united Ireland. Sometimes the response is built around the NHS, even though we have , people on waiting lists at the moment and a health service which is massively underfunded. The Union is about more, much more than the economics, and we need to be focusing on the other political cultural social et al benefits.As someone who describes himself – and I’ve done so in front of Irish and Sinn Fein audiences – as an ‘unashamed, unembarrassed and unambiguous’ unionist, I’ve always wanted unionism to be strong enough, eloquent enough and confident enough to make its case. Which is why I want unionism ready and able to make that case from any  and to any audience. Whether a border poll even happens is, to some extent, irrelevant what matters is that unionism always campaigns, articulates, reaches out and promotes its positive message on the premise that the border poll is actually happening next week.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Photo: PA PA Wire.The Tobermore man was a colossus as a goalkeeper for both Manchester United and Northern Ireland during the s early sixties and his contribution to the national team, then managed by another Co Londonderry native Peter Doherty, was immense.Harry’s main rival for the Northern Ireland goalkeeping slot at the time was another superb shot-stopper — Lurgan man Norman Uprichard, but when the team peaked in qualying for the  World Cup in Sweden, it was big Harry who got the nod from Doherty for the key slot between the sticks.Northern Ireland had travelled to Sweden on the back of a highly memorable - win over England at Wembley in November .

It was mesmerising stuff — with Newry man Peter McParland complementing Harry Gregg’s heroics at the other end with two goals.Resolutely, with bravery, Harry — this proud Ulsterman and ‘Hero of Munich” — thwarted a dominant, highly technical German team.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It’s a conversational well that is unlikely to run dry given the numerous prompts that adorn the walls, the rails and the display counters.Northern Ireland might not be as big a force in world football as the likes of Germany, France and Brazil, but per capita the Province punches well above its weight in terms of a fanaticism for football, be it the Irish League, the national team or an adopted team in England or Scotland.Mugs featuring the Irish Leagues finest: Glenn Ferguson, Gregg Davidson, Chris Walker, Billy Caskey, Jamie Mulgrew, Joe Gormley and George McMullan \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The shop which was opened in August by Ryan Gilmore, , and his business partner Pete McDonald, , taps into the rich demand for memorabilia amongst the nation’s football mad population.It leans towards the local game, celebrating the old kits and legendary stars of the Irish league, and immortalising national heroes such as Best, Whiteside, Jennings and more latterly Evans, McAuley and Healy. Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams. We’re trying to offer something a bit dferent.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: \"The Historical Environments Division is a section of the Department for Communities whose responsibility is to protect historical sites in Northern Ireland and therefore safeguard our heritage.In respect to Knock Iveagh on the outskirts of Rathfriland - a prehistoric burial site date back to  years BC and the site where the inauguration of medieval Irish Kings took place - the HED has failed and they have failed miserably. In fact had it not been for the ‘Friends of Knock Iveagh’, a public interest group, this Neolithic site would have destroyed by development that should never have been allowed.\"Having asked written questions of both the Ministers for the Communities and Infrastructure it is clear that their failing from  has led us to a situation where they have now passed the issue onto Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough council planners.\"This has put the local government planners in a dficult position. If they were to apply enforcement orders on the developers on Knock Iveagh, the ones that were given permission to develop by the Department for Infrastructure and were not stopped by the Department for the Communities, then there may be a massive compensation or legal cost for such action and that will be passed to the rate payers of the local council area. \"How can it be fair that the rate payers of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon could pick up the cost of the failings by DfC and DfI.\"It is time that both DfI and DfC - who have the powers to put Knock Iveagh back to the way it was before they mistakenly gave authority for a wind turbine development - to step up and take the financial responsibility for their mistakes. The government sponsored vandalism of a site scheduled for protection under the Historical and Archaeological Objects Order is a disgrace but allowing local council to pick up the cost compounds the damage started in  and should not be acceptable.\"A Department for Infrastructurespokesman said: “Councils are responsible for the proper administration and lawful processing of their own planning and or enforcement cases. The Department recognises the concerns and strength of feeling but, under the Transition Provisions for the transfer of the majority of planning s to the new Councils in April , responsibility for planning application permission does now lie with the Council. “The planning and enforcement issues in what is a highly complex case are also a matter for the Council. “A spokesperson for ABC Council said: “The Council is currently considering a number of Planning matters in relation to the site at Knockiveagh including requests to revoke discontinue planning permission for the wind turbine.“All of these planning matters remain under consideration at the present time,” said the spokesperson.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_2743935.jpg--.jpg?1581604995000\\","title":"no one located after multi agency search of strule river ","story":"Police received a report of a concern for safety in the Drumragh Avenue area of Omagh in the early hours of this morning .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors.

Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
