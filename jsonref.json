Doubtless, it made Putin rich, although he always presented himself as a modest man in his ill-fitting suits.One of his sternest critics was one of his officers, a young man called Alexander Litvinenko, who complained: \u0027We don\u0027t want to kidnap people, carry out contract killings, and participate in all that.\u0027         He is pictured above in 1983.

Putin also used his position to produce \u0027kompromat\u0027 – compromising material – about Yeltsin\u0027s enemies.Yeltsin rewarded Putin by making him prime minister in August 1999. Within a few months, Putin became acting president when Yeltsin resigned on New Year\u0027s Eve. Over the past two decades, Putin has put everything he learned from his days as a spy and fixer into devastating practice. The rule of law in Russia has been rendered almost meaningless by his embrace of corruption and the killings of opponents. He has established and enjoys the support of a network of some 1,000 very wealthy iniduals who rely on him for their riches and status. After he came to power, Putin reflected on his future, saying: \u0027I do believe some day I\u0027ll have a future as a private citizen, that I… will live the life of a normal person.\u0027 Such sentiments were clearly false.

You immediately descend two flights of very steep stone stairs before emerging, blinking for light, into a vast, brick-lined cavern that has the proportions of a church. The temperature drops a few degrees. The space was originally, back in the mid-19th century, the cooling warehouses for the Bavarian brewer Joseph Pfeffer. But, since Ai fled China five years ago, this has been his main place of work – and, given that the 62-year-old artist and activist is almost always working, more besides.“When I’m here, it’s like my home,” says Ai, who wears a blue hoodie and comfortable shoes, his beard less unruly than it appears in photographs. “Like my home,” he clarifies. “I’ve never had a home. In China, my studio was often destroyed. So for me, it’s a shelter – a shelter not so different from refugees in the camps that gradually build up. I can leave, of course, but since 2015, I have stayed here, never had a holiday or weekends. I’m working all the time.” His face crinkles into a smile: “I love work.”Ai’s output is prolific and erse. In 2008, he was the artistic consultant for the Olympic Stadium in Beijing, the Bird’s Nest. Two years later, he filled the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern with 100m handmade and painted porcelain sunflower seeds. Early in his career, he made a photo series of himself dropping a splendid, 2,000-year-old Han dynasty urn. Recently, he has created several powerful works – installations, video and a documentary – on the refugee crisis. War and its fallout is also the subject of his latest work, History of Bombs.Until the coronavirus outbreak, Ai’s design – a grid of 50 explosive devices from a 1911 grenade to a 2019 guided nuclear missile – was due to cover the floor of the Imperial War Museum London’s vast atrium, underneath the suspended Spitfire and Harrier jet, leading visitors to the spring exhibition, Refugees: Forced to Flee.Now the exhibition is postponed and Ai says when contacted last week: “Cultural institutions are probably the last to be damaged, but the first to show how severely this can affect our understanding about art and culture, which reflect tragic human moments like this. It is very hard to predict the future, but it seems like the situation is not going to be easily resolved and will have a strong impact. All the factors that allowed for this incident still remain the same – this could happen again – and a more thoughtful response in terms of social structure and the philosophical understanding of this situation is required.”Ai’s notoriety now of course reaches far beyond the art world. He took the 99-year lease on his Berlin studio in 2010 when he was starting to worry about his safety – his freedom – in China. He was right to be concerned: in April 2011, he was arrested and jailed for 81 days on insubstantial charges. His passport was confiscated and only returned to him in 2015, at which point he came to Germany.“When a friend showed me the space, it was in a very bad condition,” Ai recalls. “That’s why nobody wanted it: it’s dark, it’s wet, it’s cold. There’s no light down here. So I said: ‘I want it.’ He was surprised and said: ‘Why do you want it?’ And I said: ‘Because there are so many problems, and I like to solve problems!’”Before Ai was an artist, he was an architect, and it shows. The studio now has natural light from goodness knows where, and is clinically clean and dry. For the most part, anyway. A while back, he discovered water dripping from the ceiling, so he went to see his upstairs neighbour, the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, about it. “Olafur is my dear friend, but we don’t see each other very often, maybe once every three months,” says Ai. “So I said: ‘Olafur, it’s leaking!’ And he said: ‘Oh, I’m sorry.’ And I said: ‘No, don’t worry, I’ll call it a waterfall and when you have the chance, come down to sign it!’”Those who follow Ai’s work and pronouncements might be surprised to learn that he still has a base in Berlin. At the end of last year, he moved with his partner and 10-year-old son to Cambridge. In January, he gave an interview to the  in which he was so excoriating about life in Germany that you might imagine that he would never set foot in the country again. Germans, he said, “deeply don’t like foreigners”. He went even further: nazism – by his definition, as an ideology that dismisses alternative viewpoints – “perfectly exists in German daily life today”.What has been the reaction to these comments in Germany? “When I chat like this, it is only because journalists ask me and I have to answer,” says Ai. “The German response was very heavy, very dark – a form of ‘love it or leave it’, or ‘go back to China’ . Or the more intellectual was: ‘Oh, it’s only a few taxi drivers.’ And I said, ‘Yes, but that is a long ride.’”Ai guffaws, but he’s totally serious. He has to keep his studio in Berlin for now, but would like to relocate. “I know I would never get a place like this, but so what?” he says. “Many people have to leave their nation barehanded, and maybe before they used to have a palace. In China they say, you’re born as a nude person, you die as a nude person. You should understand both ends.”One of the differences Ai sees between the UK and Germany is the engagement with his work and his opinions. He says that he has done more interviews in one week with the British media than in five years with German outlets. “The Hong Kong riots, the corona situation – I thought the German press would ask what we think about it, right?” he says. “I’m not blaming them or asking for this, but it makes me feel kind of like I’m in China, because my name cannot be written.”On the evidence of this feature, a You Ask the Questions special, there is certainly an intense fascination with Ai in Britain (there are also at least a couple of questions from Germany, and submissions from all over the world). The many hundreds of inquiries ranged from his early life (Ai’s father Ai Qing was a notable poet who was ostracised for criticising the Maoist regime the family lived in a cave for five years and his father was made to clean the village toilet) to his opinions on music and food (he’s obsessed with one, not the other). At one point Ai stops me mid-sentence and marvels: “You have important questions from a lot of powerful people! Amazing!”Subject to any further disruption due to coronavirus, IWM plans to open History of Bombs this summer at IWM London as part of IWM’s Refugees season.You have moved to the UK just as we leave the European Union. What does the idea of the nation state mean to you?If you take a historical view, our map is always changing. It continues to evolve. That might be a king’s decision or the people’s decision in a democracy. I don’t think Brexit is a problem. I’ve asked many people and Britain is Britain. It has problems, but it’s still there and this doesn’t add more problems. So it’s a time for people to rethink what Britain is and how to survive.What is the most satisfying thing to you about being an artist?To not even think that I am an artist has been very satisfying for my work.In free societies, people often have the romantic feeling that better art is produced in circumstances of hardship. What would you say to that?This is a tricky question. I would say that many bad artworks have come from circumstances of hardship. But hardship can also be defined as a long period of mental and intellectual struggle.If artists aren’t active in the political space, do you think that they are essentially supporting the status quo?An artist must also be an activist – aesthetically, morally, or philosophically. That doesn’t mean they have to demonstrate in street protests, but rather deal with these issues through a so-called artistic language. Without that kind of consciousness – to be blind to human struggle – one cannot even be called an artist.What is your unrealised project?That will be death. In my life I have gone through pretty much every single trauma: communism, postmodernism, post-capitalism and globalisation, but the only project I think everyone realises is death. I know nothing about death. I haven’t met anybody who has come back to tell me their experience. So I’m waiting for the moment and it will come sooner or later.I’m happy with the work I’ve done, even though I have done so little. Often in life you don’t get the chance to do what you want. For me, that period lasted almost 45 years: I either didn’t know what I wanted to do or I knew what I wanted but I didn’t get the chance to do it. But since 2005, when I touched a computer for the first time and started to learn how to type, I began working on the internet and have been reborn. So in the past 15 years, I basically did everything and I’m pretty satisfied. If I have to die now, I have no regrets.Given you’ve designed buildings as well as installed art in a whole variety of different spaces, what can artists and architects learn from each other?This is a bit technical, but I think artists and architects are the same profession, if they’re good ones. Even doctors or politicians, they should have vision and they should understand human behaviour and try to offer possibilities for surviving intellectually or physically.How can art help the plight of refugees?Art helps human consciousness, art is about iniduals’ emotions or ideas or concepts relating to a larger cultural definition of who we are. And art can break boundaries: there’s no “refugees” or other names, even “terrorists”, we’re all human. Art tries to illustrate or explain the situation we are in. So in that sense art is dangerous because art doesn’t accept any kind of regulation or any kind of principle instead you have to go to an unknown area. Art helps our human understanding of our situation. Words like “refugee” and “terrorist” are a simplification and those words destroy the humanity.After creating so many works of art that give voice to the voiceless across the world, I wonder what are the emotions that you find easier to think, write or express in Chinese and what are the emotions you find easier to think, write or express in English? I am curious what is your relationship with each language, and how do they differ, if at all, emotionally.For Chinese readers, the sensitivity and storytelling about common feelings and people’s everyday behaviour are the most effective. For western readers, since I was not raised in the west, my arguments are more about matters of ethics and philosophy. Rationality is easier for any audience to understand.What steps do you think can we take to persuade European public opinion to be more sympathetic to taking in refugees, especially in Britain?It’s not possible to persuade anybody. You can only warn people what the consequences will be of not doing it. The idea of helping the unfortunate has always existed in most religionsIt’s easy to understand but I don’t think people will do it in practice. So, in my work, I’d rather warn about wh at will happen if we are not more sympathetic towards refugees. And that’s what I’m doing.Aren’t you discouraged by the lack of political change in China after fighting for so long?Anonymous, CroatiaI’m totally discouraged. But I’m very fortunate I committed to fighting China because China is the ideal opponent. He never dies, you cannot beat him with one punch. So it is my life’s work.You mostly look unhappy. Are you happy, Mr Weiwei?Uwe Wache, GermanyI am the happiest person with the saddest face on Earth.Where did all the sesame seeds go? Can I get some?Nick, SpainAh, the sunflower seeds? Yes, give me your address I will send you one. They are for someone who doesn’t mind seeing a dentist, because they will break their teeth on them! But seriously, in China, all the activists love these seeds, they call them the seeds of freedom. So we’ve sent out a few million seeds. It’s very costly, but they give them to their loved ones as wedding or engagement presents. They make a little earring or something. They really love them. I don’t know why.Are the people in Hong Kong fighting a lost cause?Anonymous, Hong Kong I have said this before: they have already won. As soon as you start to fight – you can be the weakest or strongest – you have won. Of course, it’s very hard to win against a communist regime, but you never die if you keep fighting. So it’s like me: am I winning? I think in a certain way I’m impactful. But I’ll get old, I will die and who cares?Of all of your accomplishments, artistic and political, what are you personally most proud of? Vincent Elliott, CanadaI’m proud that I retain a clear mind with sensitivity and judgment. If there is one honour I’d love, it’s to be known as a clear-minded man. Some of my work is more popular, some less, but that is not so important. You make an effort, that’s the most important thing. I think anybody who wants to make the effort can create better work than me.Has becoming a parent had an impact on your art?Lorraine Pink, AustraliaOh yes, definitely it helps me. Whatever I did before is like half of the circle becoming a parent makes the circle full. So it’s very important for me, even if I understand very little about doing it. But still, it’s a gift, so you accept that gift. Also, it’s only when you become a parent you understand your own parents. That’s important, too.What do you miss most about China?John, SaigonWhat I miss most is standing on the ground in China and fighting for its survival.You believe German society is intolerant to refugees – what has led you to that conclusion?Samuel Worz, GermanyI have undergone a long period of study and research on this issue. German intolerance is not simply my impression, but a view formed by observing the German response to many different issues. Germany has failed not only when it comes to supporting refugees, but also on other political issues, such as dealing with authoritarian states like China. It has shown indifference to the struggle for democracy in Hong Kong. If you look at Germany’s pattern of responses to China, you can only conclude that most German politicians are not interested in ideology, but rather are focused on their own business interests.Does music inspire you, and if so what do you listen to?Anonymous, JapanNot at all! I wouldn’t say that I don’t like music, but I have never really turned on music in my life. I have good equipment, I have a lot of musician friends and I have perfect understanding of music. I can analyse music with my musician friends and conductors and they say: “You understand music so well!” But it’s like a parallel world in which I’m an alien. When I listen to it, I can rationalise happy emotions, but I don’t like music. I like silence. No sound at all. Maybe I belong to death.Last year you bought 30 tons of buttons from A Brown \u0026amp Co when the business closed. What plans do you have for them?Bill Brown, USAWhat a pain! We have started to analyse and measure and categorise them. We’re still working on that. At the moment, we don’t have a plan for them. We never do anything without totally understanding the situation, or at least thinking that we totally understand the situation. We want to find joy, then we can turn it into some other kind of joy.Would you rather fight a horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?Ian Tinkler, ShetlandI have no preference. I don’t see the difference between my opponents. What I am fighting is an ideology, which has no clear shape or size.As a young man, you destroyed art and cultural artefacts. Do you still see those acts in the same way you did then?Amy Thompson, MexicoMy work has a solid understanding, but, at the same time, it happens intuitively. It cannot be repeated or clearly defined by the author.Do you enjoy cooking? What would you serve at a dinner party?Nigel Simpson, UKYes, tremendously, mainly because my stomach is very sensitive, particularly to food. Cooking is relaxing. Cooking or cutting hair or whatever is a total break from other activities, and stops you getting burned out.What I cook depends on what’s there when I open the refrigerator. I always find something, but my cooking secret is that I cannot cook the same dish twice. I automatically avoid cooking anything the same. It doesn’t matter if it is such a good dish: “Can you redo it?” No, not possible. I see it as art. And I’m not the kind of artist that repeats the same work for 20 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21cd793c7267dd3fd4c79edc123a4df84c5c7c49/0_335_6459_3875/master/6459.jpg?width=6250\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d41d69ec569b2a29fb58847e6511e14c 6250w","title":"northern stars wakefields mining life in pictures","story":"Illustrator and mural artist Seanna Doonan “grew up singing songs about the miners’ strike and other historical and social struggles”.

With ideas such as universal basic income now being championed, Covid-19 could do likewiseRishi Sunak says the measures he has announced to support the economy are without precedent in peacetime – and he’s right. Never before has the British state agreed to pay the wages of those at risk of losing their jobs. Never before has the government ordered the pubs to shut.The chancellor is not the only one to see the struggle against the coronavirus pandemic as like a military operation. Boris Johnson sees this as the summer of 1940, with himself as Churchill.Harking back to the second world war is inevitable given how strongly influenced Britain is by an event that ended 75 years ago, but there are some key differences.The main one is that between 1939 and 1945 the economy was running at full tilt. It took the fight against Hitler finally to eradicate the high unemployment of the 1920s and 1930s. Britain had full employment and would have had rising inflation had it not been for rationing and price controls.Instead of production being scaled up, it is being scaled back. There are a few sectors where activity is rising – food production and healthcare – but those increases will be dwarfed by the lost output elsewhere. Around one-third of workers in the UK have jobs in the sectors most affected by the pandemic: retail, restaurants, bars, clubs, hotels, cinemas, theatres, gyms, sport – and they are all closed for business for months to come. This is not 1940, with factories working round the clock: it is more like a neutron-bomb attack that targets the people but leaves the buildings unscathed.Another big difference is that unlike in 1940 it is not just a question of holding on until the Americans get involved. The US was never at threat of being invaded and was able to put its enormous economy on a war footing.But the US is not immune from the coronavirus. On the contrary, it is going to suffer grievously from it: in part because Donald Trump was in denial about the risks in part because the public healthcare system is so poor and in part because the social safety net is so weak. America, due to its size and its place at the heart of the global financial system, will still have a vital role to play in any recovery. But the number of people losing their jobs as large parts of the economy go into hibernation is going to be colossal. America is currently where it was in 1930, when the dole queues were lengthening after the Wall Street crash, rather than in its much more robust state a decade later.Those seeking parallels with the second world war need to broaden their perspective. One way of looking at today’s events is to see the 15 years before the financial crisis of 2007-08 as the equivalent of the years leading up to the first world war. Although this seemed a peaceful, prosperous period – the so-called long Edwardian summer – things were not quite as benign as they seemed. The global balance of power was changing there was political unrest and there was growing class conflict. The first few years of the 21st century – marked by debt-fueled growth and financial market anarchy were just as delusional.The mood of complacency was shattered by the financial crisis, just as it had been by the outbreak of war in 1914. In both cases, winning the struggle proved harder than expected and in both cases there was an attempt once victory had been declared to go back to business as usual: balanced budgets and a return to the Gold Standard in the 1920s balanced budgets, debt-driven growth and financial speculation in the 2010s.But turning the clock back proved impossible. Political discontent and anger grew as economies struggled. Trust in the democratic process frayed. There was little international co-operation.Then, around a decade and a half later in both cases, there was a second shock: the collapse of the financial bubble in 1929 the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. If history is any guide, it is the second shock that makes fundamental change possible.Four big things happened in the 1930s and 1940s. Firstly, the old economics was abandoned. Countries came off the Gold Standard and states began to pump-prime growth, albeit timidly in most cases. Maynard Keynes’s general theory inspired an entire generation of economists and policymakers.Secondly, there was an attempt to inject equity into economies through enhanced power for trade unions, more progressive taxation and the expansion of welfare states.Thirdly, work began early on this progressive agenda. In Britain, the Beveridge report, the Butler education act and the white paper on employment all emerged while the the second world war was still raging.Finally, there were attempts to build a new international architecture – through the creation of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – that would avoid the policy fragmentation of the 1930s.How close are we to a repeat of all this? Just consider, a model that has failed not once but twice has been ditched. Governments recognise they have to support their citizens through this. New ideas – such as universal basic income – are being championed. And without multilateral cooperation there will be no victory against Covid-19. Sunak is right. This is different, perhaps more fundamentally so than he thinks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1728cdcb91a98349eff11ad7c47dfa58f2fbf47/0_102_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adbf6d697078d6243bc3929ab195845a","title":"coronavirus self isolation mothers day appreciate mum","story":"Thanks to this crisis, I don’t know when I’ll see my brilliant mum again. I want her know how grateful I am to herWe emerged from isolation yesterday to post Mother’s Day cards, the short walk around the corner to the postbox offering a degree of novelty I never thought I would come to crave. I chose Matisse’s Woman in Blue: a red-headed woman who looks like a queen. Fitting, for my mum.I once had an editor who didn’t like the word “mum”. Maybe she thought it was, I don’t know, mumsy, a word that is often used in a derisive tone. Mumsy is defined as “giving an impression of dull domesticity dowdy or unfashionable”. How unfair that, on top of all the bum-wiping and wound-dressing and tucking-in and spoon-feeding, mothers should have to contend with an image problem for frequently performing those tasks.I think “mum” is a warm word, capturing the way so many of us feel towards the women who raised us. “My mother” may sound more erudite, conveying a sort of refined, intellectual distance, bringing to mind – like the use of the term Mothering Sunday – a less touchy-feely type of human relations. Mothering Sunday, of course, used to be the day off that servants were given so they could return to their “mother parishes” to see the women who birthed them, gathering wildflowers along the way.Anyway, I’ve been thinking of the mums a lot this week, especially my own, who is up north while I am down south. I’m not sure when I’ll see her again, and that in itself is strange. The mums must be in overdrive at the moment, whether their children are young or grown up. Children must be entertained and fed, now schools are closed. Extra hugs are needed, the kettle almost always on. Their phones are likely to be ringing off the hook with thousands and thousands of calls from people imploring their mums to stay inside. Because, for the lucky majority, a mum is a precious person, she must be kept around for as long as possible. The mums will also be fielding calls from anxious adult children worried about their own health, the health of other people in the family, and what they’ll do for money. People don’t stop needing emotional support when they cease to be a child. The work of mothering continues, and becomes especially important in times of crisis.Much of that work is hidden within the domestic sphere, or taken for granted. Beneath the sickly sentimentality and all the marketing gubbins, Mother’s Day is an opportunity to simply say “thank you” and “I love you”. Naomi Stadlen’s beloved book What Mothers Do: Especially When it Looks Like Nothing was a much-needed corrective to that phrase “I got nothing done all day” – a common refrain of new mothers, who are too hard on themselves. There is still no real lexicon within a capitalist system for the nameless feats of caring that mothers continuously achieve, such as the offering of comfort, in the face of constant interruption.I’m wary of falling into a gendered trap when writing about mothering, because so often women and men are shoehorned into an emotionalintellectual dichotomy, even though our mothers shape us intellectually too. Words like mumsy detract from that fact there’s a notion that the domestic sphere cannot intersect with the intellectual – a false dichotomy that is steadily being demolished by writers such as Elena Ferrante, as well as an upcoming generation of thinkers. In Liz Berry’s poem, The Republic of Motherhood, she calls the multifaceted gifts that mothers bestow “a whole wild fucking queendom”. We all know mothers who are geniuses, mothers who are polymaths, mothers who are great wits, mothers who are hard as nails, mothers who get things done. Despite the myths that swirl around mothers, they are ultimately just people with children, performing a role that is often thankless, while fighting to maintain their other many identities. Even in 2020, with so many feminist advances, that remains a challenge.When I visualise my mum, I think of her standing in front of an easel. There’s opera on the record player, the sort I used to whine about when I was a child, covering my ears, and now sometimes find myself enjoying. She is painting a canvas in bright, abstract colours. Around her is all the domestic chaos of my childhood home. The walls are covered in scribbles. The Thomas the Tank Engine soundtrack comes blasting from the next room, where my brother is building towers. In this vision of the past, I’m reading a book somewhere, trying to ignore the yowling cat. Our tea’s in the oven, after which she’ll put my brother to bed, sing him to sleep, and cuddle up to me on the sofa. For me, she was, and remains, the still point of the turning world.I’ve watched my mum caring for my severely disabled brother over the years, always putting her children first while managing to maintain her need to think and create, and my main feeling is one of awe. I know my friends feel similarly about their own mothers, whether it’s the retrospective realisation in adulthood that she somehow fed a family of five on less than £30 a week, or the sudden understanding, after losing a much-wanted baby, of the miscarriage she suffered. As we grow we have these watershed moments where it hits us: “She lived through this.” Mums are beacons of wisdom and experience. They are often humans of unquestionable strength, who never make a meal of how resilient they are.Not everyone is lucky enough to have a mum who is still around, and some will be lost or already have been lost in the human tragedy of the coronavirus pandemic. There are others who have never been given the gift of mother love, whether from absence, abuse or neglect. To have experienced it is a privilege. I understand that even more as this current crisis escalates. I may not be able to hold my mum close this year, but I want her to know that I understand, and that I’m grateful. I always will be.• Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a  columnist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43331c3d114a267a982482429e818ce4ed36901/0_225_2660_1596/master/2660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d946569e7f7d7aaa84f74f9799e480b","title":"economists pandemic predictions covid 19","story":"A US congressional budget office paper from that period examines the economic impact of various sizes of pandemic, from a repeat of the 1918-19 Spanish flu to the less lethal Hong Kong flu in the 1960s. It is particularly prescient.First, it notes that modern flus will spread faster and cross national borders. Tick.On short-term economic effects, it points to a surge in demand for hospital equipment, capacity pressures on staff, a collapse of air travel and a period of people quarantining themselves, thus driving down retail sales.

Yet with employers and professional bodies insisting that measures taken during the pandemic must not lead to lower standards, universities are likely to see Imperial’s strategy as a way forward.“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first digital ‘open book’ exam delivered remotely for final-year students,” said Dr Amir Sam, Imperial’s head of undergraduate medicine. Open-book exams allow students access to any resource material they may need during the exam.Students in their sixth year of medical studies logged in at 1pm on Wednesday and Friday to demonstrate their ability to diagnose a patient’s condition. They were presented with a patient and given their history, findings from clinical examination and data from investigations such as blood tests. They then had to answer 150 questions in three hours, meaning they had 72 seconds to answer each one.“It wasn’t possible to answer questions that require putting all this information together by simply looking things up online,” Dr Sam said. “This is exactly like having a patient in front of you.”Dr Sam said the medical profession had been nervous about open-book exams, fearing that students would cheat. “No one has ever been able to run these things before. No university has been brave enough,” he said. “The other thing we did was randomise the order of questions for each student. That made it impossible for them to help each other.”The papers are marked automatically online. “We are looking at the psychometric analysis of the data and comparing it with previous exams that were closed-book. If we show it has behaved in a similar way to a closed-book exam, then that is a new era for medical assessment.”Online learning has become the new standard for education in just a few days, after Boris Johnson announced last Wednesday that all schools were to shut.GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled, but universities run their own exam systems independently, and many are struggling with the problem of how to assess students, particularly those due to graduate this year.Some, including Glasgow, Birmingham, Bristol and Exeter, have said they will use online exams and other forms of remote assessment.They called on the university to allow those due to graduate this summer to restart the final year in September or at Easter 2021, and to offer alternative assessments, such as vivas conducted via video, a portfolio of essays or coursework instead of exams, or postponing deadlines until after social distancing and quarantine measures have been relaxed.Similar letters signed by 1,200 students at Edinburgh University and 1,000 from the Bristol University said students should be able to choose to take a mark based on their existing assessments or do an exam or essay if they wanted to improve it.Those concerns were echoed by David Laws, the former education minister and now executive chairman of the Education Policy Institute. EPI research shows that by the time students finish their GCSEs, those eligible for free school meals are 18.1 months behind their classmates in English and maths attainment.“Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are the ones who benefit the most from being in a school environment, where their needs can be supported,” Laws said. “They are the children who, when they go home because of the school closures, will face the most challenging learning circumstances because of a comparative lack of books, learning resources, IT and parents with the capacity to help. There is a real risk that if there is a prolonged school closure, it is going to hit the more vulnerable children the most.”Yet universities also need to keep high standards, according to Katrina Smyth, head of quality and recognition at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, a position shared by other professional bodies, such as the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.“We were very clear to universities that we will be flexible in our approach,” Smyth said. “What we would say is that standards have to be maintained. There must still be an assurance that students have met the learning outcomes in the modules.”The University and College Union, which represents lecturers, said they needed to be involved in designing the new system.“Staff, rather than managers with little or no experience in the classroom, must be central to the designing of any new systems as they know what will work best,” said Jo Grady, UCU’s general secretary. “As well as dealing with the academic challenges, we need to consider the extra demands on staff time for pastoral care and student welfare.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc54434068f570a7c3aa75bd1a813bd41623b1a8/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9844ab23ea5ae3b46c6543ad40f8fd30","title":"royal college of music 40m pound upgrade","story":"It is one of the world’s great conservatoires, with composer Benjamin Britten and singer Dame Joan Sutherland are among those who trained there. But for decades the Royal College of Music has struggled to showcase its star power and its collection of instruments in headquarters that have been described by some as forbidding and drab.Now, following a £40m transformation – funded in part by donations from artists including the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli – the RCM is unveiling an ambitious new look. The redesigned buildings – due to be officially opened later this year – include London’s newest state-of-the art concert halls and a museum featuring more than 15,000 treasures, including the world’s oldest guitar. Professor Colin Lawson, the RCM’s director, told the Observer: “People have walked past here without really knowing whether they’re allowed in or not. It was pretty forbidding at one time. The redesign is all about opening up everything.”As part of the makeover, a disused courtyard in South Kensington has become a vast, light-filled conservatory that leads off to two concert halls and a museum, as well as dozens of additional practice rooms, recording and digital facilities and a large cafe where recitals will also be staged.A glorified 1960s hut that used to house the museum has been demolished. The RCM can now do justice to its collection, which covers music-making over more than five centuries, from the earliest stringed keyboard instrument (a 1480s clavicytherium) to Mozart’s score for his Piano Concerto No 24 in C minor, complete with his doodles in the margin. Through headphones, interactive displays will allow visitors to hear the music. Lawson said that, although the Victorian-era design had been “fantastic”, “all kinds of social interaction” had now become possible.The RCM was founded in 1882 by the then Prince of Wales, later Edward VII. Its alumni include the composer Gustav Holst, the conductor Sir Colin Davis, and the flautist Sir James Galway. Today it trains around 800 students from 55 countries. In 2019, it was ranked as the UK’s top institution for the performing arts in the QS World University Rankings. “In 2020, we’re also number one in Europe and number two in the world,” Lawson said.The public is already able to attend concerts and masterclasses, but the new buildings will increase access and expand programmes, mostly with free entry.Masterclasses are by international stars such as Maxim Vengerov, the violin virtuoso.Lawson said: “The thing about a Vengerov masterclass is that the students sound absolutely wonderful until he picks up the violin and then suddenly ‘wow, this is what’s possible’.”Transforming the RCM’s Grade\u0026nbspII-listed home has taken two-and-a-half years in a project headed by John Simpson, whose work on historic buildings includes the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace.He is a favourite architect of Prince Charles, president of the RCM’s fundraising campaign, which has seen one of its biggest investments. Bocelli is among those who have donated money, along with the National Lottery Heritage Fund, trusts and foundations.Simpson’s approach uses updated traditional forms to respond to contemporary requirements. He has done exactly that at the RCM, with light and airy spaces. Joanna Wachowiak, director of John Simpson Architects, said: “The idea was to provide space for people to practise, space for people to eat and congregate, space for audiences to come and space to teach.”The RCM says that the performance hall and studio – seating 150 and 90, respectively – have been designed for the highest standards of music-making with the most sophisticated technology. A beautiful white lattice-work decorates the hall’s walls, but serves a purpose that goes beyond the aesthetic, namely “sound-scattering”. The walls incorporate sound-absorbent banners, which can be adjusted to suit different types of performance, while advanced air-handling and climate-control enable the most delicate instruments from the museum to be played. “Every bit of the design or decoration has a purpose,” said Simpson.Lawson said: “When the college opened, the future king was proud of the fact that the daughter of a brick-maker was a student. We’ve carried on that tradition but of course we’re in a very competitive environment. There are a lot of endowments in America and you can go to a German conservatoire for nothing.”The redevelopment has excited musicians. Lang Lang, the Chinese pianist, said: “In developing its already iconic and exceptional facilities, the RCM has committed to ensuring a world-leading experience for future students and visitors.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7709a8bb32e389a3185d900d4bbc3760f50c74e/0_33_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a973210e0d231d51816261b2eabf712d","title":"rare andean bears flock to cloud forest to feast on wild avocados aoe","story":"The real-life Paddington bears were in decline across South America, but records suggest their numbers are growing in EcuadorDeep in the Maquipucuna cloud forest, two hours drive from Ecuador’s capital, Quito, rare Andean bears come together for a few weeks each year to feast on the wild avocados ripening atop mist-shrouded trees.According to ecologists, this small community is growing, bucking the trend of a vulnerable species in decline across South America. The gathering, similar to those of grizzly bears at salmon rivers in Alaska and Canada, is turning what experts know about this normally reclusive, solitary creature on its head.“Throughout the Andes, because of habitat loss, we would expect to see a population in decline,” said Rebeca Justicia, a conservationist and co-founder of the Maquipucuna Foundation and reserve. “But locally we have seen a spike in the population. We are even seeing mothers with cubs, which is very unusual.”There are believed to be fewer than 10,000 of these bears left across the northern Andes. Listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature red list, they face an increasingly uncertain future due to habitat destruction and hunting.Justicia set up the Maquipucuna Foundation with her husband, Rodrigo Ontaneda, 30 years ago. They were instrumental in persuading many local communities to stop ranching and timber farming and lobbied for protection of the wider Chocó-Andino Pichincha region, which was finally declared a Unesco biosphere reserve in 2018.“When we started our project, it was very hard to see a bear,” said Justicia. “We heard, anecdotally, there were bears here and that people hunted them.”Andean or spectacled bears, which have earned global attention thanks to the fictional Paddington Bear, are hunted for parts used in the international wildlife trade – gall bladders, used in oriental medicine, can fetch as much as $150 (£116) and there is a large market in Ecuador for bear paws.Justicia spotted her first Andean bear in 2008. Since then, she says, she has recorded 40 different bears, based on photographs taken in the 6,500-hectare (16,061-acre) Maquipucuna reserve, identifying iniduals from unique facial markings. Other experts have counted up to 19 bears in the forest in a single year.“We see an unusually high number of bears during the wild avocado season because they congregate around this abundant source of food,” said Justicia. “The small avocados have very large quantities of fat and oil and that is hard to get in a vegetarian diet. They can come and feed for weeks.”Little is known about these creatures. Their chosen territory, in dense cloud forest and the high Andes, the fact they may cover up to 10km in a single day, as well as their timid and solitary natures, makes them difficult to study.But the bear gatherings are helping ecologists understand more about them. Two Andean bears from Maquipucuna, filmed in 2017, were recently featured in BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet series, climbing trees to get at the fruit.“Generally, all bears are solitary,” said Justicia. “The first year we realised this place was different was in 2008. The next year, it went crazy, we saw females with cubs. One February we realised how many bears came together and we began to record them.”Each Andean bear needs around 1,000 hectares of territory, so the reserve itself would only support six iniduals.Justicia compares the gatherings to those of Alaskan grizzlies that come together at salmon rivers. The bears arrive in the dry months, from September to December, but it is unpredictable, because the avocados do not ripen at the same time every year.“We still don’t know how the bears decided to come to Maquipucuna,” said Justicia. “But we are learning more and more every year.”Santiago Molina, a bear expert from San Francisco University of Quito, has carried out his own study of bear numbers in a 65,000-hectare region within the metropolitan district of Quito. His analysis of camera traps has led to an estimate of around 65 bears in the entire region, an area including Maquipucuna but 10 times the size. Molina is sceptical of the numbers recorded by Justicia, although he recorded 19 bears in the reserve in one season in 2009 and said 15 were spotted within two months in 2017 inside the reserve boundaries.He is both excited and worried about the rising numbers of what he describes as “Quito’s bears”. The proximity to human populations brings its own dangers.“This is new,” said Molina, whose work led to the creation of the Andean Bear Corridor, or Corredor del Oso Andino, by the Quito government to protect the bears’ habitat. “It is changing the whole concept of bears. Five years ago, people did not believe there were bears in this area, in the Quito corridor. Before, the bears we studied were in the highlands, the grasslands, not forests, and bears were known to be solitary animals.”Those bears living in the forest exhibit different behaviour from highland bears, he said. They are known to hunt, dispelling the myth they are mostly vegetarian.“I have video of a bear hunting a deer – that was a myth for years,” said Molina. “I suspect most of the bears living here have already tasted meat, from feeding on meat left around, for instance when a cow dies. Bears have good scents and are very opportunistic.”“Now we hear of bear-human conflicts. It is a population under threat,” he added.He is starting a project in the Yunguilla community, with the international association for bear research and management, to help farmers reduce the chance of bears coming into contact with their cattle and crops.“We have an opportunity to address this.

Britain will have no choice, he says, but to engage with the commercial sector in large-scale planting of imported conifers, despite fears of the impact on habitats and wildlife.Such a move risks incurring public anger, if its 20th-century precursor is anything to go by. “People felt it was bad for landscape, bioersity and amenity,” said Healey. “Both the public and conservation professionals saw many negative effects on heathland there was the notorious draining of the peat bogs of the Flow Country in the far north of Scotland some really important habitats were left decimated by tree planting.”In 2017 the UK was the second largest net importer of forest products, behind China. Yet only 1,420 hectares of woodland were planted in England in the year to March 2019, against the government’s target of 5,000 hectares. Wales and Northern Ireland planted 520 hectares and 240 hectares respectively.The Conservatives have pledged to plant 30 million trees a year between 2020 and 2025. But Healey said such targets faced stiff challenges. Indigenous species grow too slowly to be an efficient option for rapid carbon fixation, he said. Unharvested woodland eventually stops sequestering carbon when it reaches maturity.But conifer forests are harvested for timber, allowing new trees to be planted. He said: “The trees that produce this commercial timber and can grow in this country are virtually all non-native and are predominantly conifers from North America.”The need to plant more trees is now an urgent priority to tackle the climate emergency. Mature tropical forests in Africa and the Amazon are slowing their rate of carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere and may soon become a source of emissions, as trees die.Healey said it was time to be pragmatic. “Many people think we can have this huge expansion of tree planting in the UK and it will all happen without costing us as the taxpayer that much money. We also think it will all be nice, native species woodland of broadleaved trees and lots of bioersity but it’s just economically impossible.”“People and politicians have got to face up to the fact that the vast majority of this tree planting, if it’s to occur at the scale they have talked about, is going to have to come from commercial investments, and forest and environmental policy has got to avoid getting in the way of that unnecessarily,” Healey said. “Planting is catastrophically slow in England and Wales, and many commercial investors feel that they are held back from acquiring land and converting it to woodland because of the way that the whole raft of environmental and other policy regulations are implemented.”Many endangered species – such as curlews and lapwings – depend on open habitats like moors and heaths.“Everyone agrees that the best of these habitats should be protected,” Healey said. “But a lot of them are in really poor condition. Is restoration the best use of all this land, or should some, instead, be converted to conifer plantations or native woodlands? We need to ask how much of our heathland we need to protect or restore and how much we can convert to rapid carbon sequestration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4172f0ef3aa14fd0998f27534122c2dbd947d14d/0_0_3334_2223/master/3334.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05f49600e1607fa952fa096fdf325930","title":"fashion makeover shows never go out fashion","story":"Anyone who wanted to know a scrunchie from a shoulder pad tuned into The Clothes Show on BBC in the 1980s and 90s. It demystified the fashion world for the masses, and once pulled in nine million viewers. Now, TV is embracing fashion again – on all formats.This week BBC One is showing You Are What You Wear, the channel’s first makeover show in 15 years. Meanwhile, Amazon Prime will release Making The Cut this Friday, where guest judges including the model Naomi Campbell and fashion editor Carine Roitfeld will award a winning designer $1m and, in a heartwarming moment of synergy, a deal for their clothes to be sold exclusively through Amazon. This follows hot on the heels of Netflix hit, Next In Fashion, where designers from around the world competed against each other to be the next big name.“Fashion shows are accessible because we all get up and get dressed every day,” says Sara Rea, Making The Cut’s executive producer and showrunner. “Making The Cut illustrates that fashion is moving into a more inclusive place where everyone has a place.”The idea of a fashion democracy is at the heart of the BBC’s You Are What You Wear. The show features people with everyday clothing problems that are solved by a team of five stylists. In the first episode, participants include a PE teacher who doesn’t know how to wear anything apart from tracksuits and a man who is 5ft 3in and has dressed from the children’s section all his life.The executive producer, Ceri Aston, explains: “The makeover format just works on telly. If somebody puts on an amazing outfit, they’re going to feel different. What we wanted to do is ask, ‘who are the people that are going to make those transformations and why are their stories relevant?’”Absent from this new breed of fashion show is the acerbic tone associated with programmes such as America’s Next Top Model, Ugly Betty and Absolutely Fabulous.For Queer Eye’s Tan France, who presents Next In Fashion, tone is key. “I made it very clear to the creators of the show that I wouldn’t be involved with a show that pushes a negative, drama-filled narrative,” he says. “It would go against what I do on Queer Eye.”In an era of reality shows defined by Queer Eye, but also The Great British Bake Off and First Dates, viewers want to see things work out and not go awry. “There’s enough drama in the world,” says France, “we’ve created a show that provides an escape from that.”Aston looked back to How To Look Good Naked’s Gok Wan for inspiration. “The way he interacted with his women with warmth and approachability was something we wanted to do on the show,” she says. “You don’t want it to be like Changing Rooms circa 1992 being like ‘what did you do to my house?’”As traditional TV tropes change, so have formats. More brands are live streaming shows on Instagram. Last week Tokyo Fashion week was streamed live, and it was announced that menswear trade show Pitti Uomo would have a strong digital presence which many interpreted as more streamed shows.Outside official channels, fashion influencers primarily reside on Instagram, TikTok has become the natural home for “how to” extreme beauty tutorials, and edgy makeover shows such as PAQ and the Go Fug Yourself-style critiques of vlogger Haute Le Mode sit perfectly in bitesize chunks on YouTube. On 6 April, Quibi, a mobile-only service, is set to launch. With snippet segments of eight to 10 minutes each, it is a platform which is hugely influenced by the structure of social-media streaming. Among the fashion content will be Potty Talk, a toilet-based chatshow hosted by Alexander Wang, and Fashion’s A Drag, a fashion news show. “Instagram has definitely influenced how we share our fashion and influence others,” explains Willam, the former Drag Race star and host. “So it’s becoming more and more popular.”The synergy of social media and TV is part of what led the BBC to commission You Are What You Wear. “The popularity of fashion on those other platforms is the reason the BBC were in the market for another makeover show,” says Aston. “The last one they had was Trinny and Susannah.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c509355e68187bf80b04b0307a7e22ce7643592a/0_463_7617_4572/master/7617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b678dee49d965ec4e7af33dbee149f6c","title":"mark wahlberg i was a little rough around the edges","story":"From troubled youth to boy band to model to Hollywood royalty… Mark Wahlberg talks to Sophie Heawood about fighting, family and his newfound faithThe actor Mark Wahlberg is sitting beside me on a sofa in a Beverly Hills hotel, muscles bulging out of his T-shirt, immaculate white trainers resting on a chair, as he tells me about the aggressive figure ruining his home life. “He’s angry, he gets violent,” he says, his face full of defeat, even though he’s no stranger to the rough stuff himself, having played countless hard guys in Hollywood movies after serving jail time for assault in his youth. “And then he goes to the bathroom right on the floor and wipes himself on the floor,” sighs the man who posed topless with Kate Moss in Calvin Klein underwear ads that seemed to cover every London bus in the 90s. “And he likes to do that in front of me and then give me a look, like, go pick that up, before he walks out.”Mark Wahlberg, who also starred as the porn star Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights, but who has now found God and starts every day with prayer, sighs.It must be quite a sight, this bum-wiping, given that we are discussing the Wahlberg family’s Pomeranian dog, who appears, in pictures published on his own Instagram account, to be less than a foot long and made only from fluff and eyes. And given that the floor is that of the Beverly Hills mansion shared by Mark with his wife and four children, which not only has a chapel, a cinema and a pool, but also its own golf course – what an image it creates in my mind’s eye, this ball of fluff wiping his bum on the floor.Yet I’m confused. Of course, I know that Instagram’s a sham, but every time I’ve seen Mark bellow “Number one Pomeranian on the ’gram!” in a video, beseeching his 14.5m followers to look at Champeranian’s own account, I thought the enthusiasm was real. Turns out he’s been doing it under duress from one of his sons, Brendan, “whose life mission is to get me to post as many things as I can about Champ, and get him as many followers as he can. He’s obsessed with it. It’s starting to become… a thing.”While we’re on the subject of violent antics, I want to talk about Wahlberg’s latest movie, Spenser Confidential, made for Netflix. Wahlberg plays Spenser, a former cop who has served five years in jail for trying to expose his corrupt colleagues, only to get released and find they’re still after him. Directed by Peter Berg, with whom Wahlberg also made Patriots Day and Lone Survivor, the film straddles a border between comedy and action, with the action winning out.Wahlberg is the sort of actor who wants to be absolutely on top of the script. He reads it “three to four times a day” to “really know where we are, continuity-wise. I like to know what we’re doing and how we’re doing it,” he says, and adds that last sentence firmly, as if he has little patience for messing about. “At one point, Pete was trying to push the humour, and then we pulled it back a little bit, I think. I think you can get into some trouble, trying too hard for comedy – it’s just a fine line.”It’s the violence I want to discuss anyway. Wahlberg says that growing up the youngest of nine children in a deprived area of Boston, he was bullied by older brothers, “and when I walked out my door – violence is also all that was there.” Aged 13, he had an opportunity to join his brother Donnie in New Kids on the Block, a globally successful boy band, but he left after a few months, perhaps inevitably, given that he was already in trouble with the police and addicted to cocaine and other substances. He later found his own music success as Marky Mark, in Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, and the acting followed. But of his youth, he stresses: “I was always in trouble, and I was kind of little. In the circumstances where I was being preyed upon, at times, I had to protect and defend myself. It’s not an easy thing to navigate as a teenage kid who’s 5ft 2in, 120lb, with grown men.”It was decades ago now, and clearly not something he wants to discuss for the rest of his life, but there was a racist element to some of his crimes particularly when, while high on the drug PCP, he assaulted a Vietnamese shopkeeper and used racial slurs against him. Wahlberg served a brief sentence for it the shopkeeper has since said that he publicly forgives him. I put it to Wahlberg that, if he were a new actor coming up now, with that kind of record, he would or should get cancelled. Hollywood is trying to do the right thing, morally, at the moment.“Well…” he exhales. “I don’t know. I think it would be easy to look at it and say that, but having been through it and experienced it, I think it’s a different thing. You see the gentleman who just came in here?”He is referring to a burly man who just popped in for a goodbye hug, covered in tattoos, and who plays a small role in Spenser Confidential.“He just did 16 years in prison. OK? He got out and I put him in the movie. That could have easily been my life. Being in a situation like that and having nothing else – certainly I made a lot of terrible mistakes and I paid for those mistakes dearly.” He says that people often think of being incarcerated as though it’s a badge of honour, “but having been in that situation, it’s not”. He realised that the only way to change his circumstances was “to actually change them”, and then he “did the work. I took it upon myself to own up to my mistakes and go against the grain and not be a part of the gang any more – to say that I was going to go and do my own thing. Which made it 10 times more difficult to walk from my home to the train station, to go to school, to go to work.”So you made yourself more vulnerable? “Oh absolutely. But I also prided myself on doing the right thing and turning my life around. Whether I found myself venturing off into Hollywood and a music career, or working a 9-to-5 job as a construction worker, whatever path I was going to take, I was going to do the right thing. So I think no, judging a person on what he’s doing and where he’s coming from and all those things, no, I would hope that people would be able to get a second chance in life.There have been benefits from all of this, he says. “I do think the one thing I have to my advantage is that I have all this real life experience that I can apply to my work,” he says. “I think audiences can definitely sense authenticity. But that came with a real price.”So why, then, would he play such violent characters if the very impulse is something he wants to get away from? He has a huge resumé of playing boxers, bruisers and bent cops. He won a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for The Departed, directed by Martin Scorsese, in which he plays a killer. And his work as a producer on The Fighter and Boardwalk Empire, with equal amounts of fighting and pain, is also much admired and award-nominated.There have been comedies, too, such as the Daddy’s Home movies, where his machismo is pitched against the goofiness of Will Ferrell. (A couple of years ago Wahlberg revealed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that he had found out that one of his daughters was having private Instagram chats with Will Ferrell’s son Magnus – Mark was “disturbed” but then realised, if she was going to be with somebody, it would be good if it was someone who was similar to his friend Will.)Boogie Nights made Wahlberg hugely famous, though he has said since that he has some regrets about it, that it doesn’t quite fit in with the Catholicism to which he is now devoted, getting up early every morning to make time for “the scriptures and my devotionals”, and attending Mass each week. He recently posted an Instagram video of his face with the mark of the cross on it in ash, having attended an Ash Wednesday service in LA. His best work, he says, might just be Ted, the unlikely story of a man who continues into adulthood with his best friend, a talking teddy bear. Yet even that has a fight scene in it – one which he only lets his kids watch with the sound off, because his character shouts “Teddy Rux-fuckin’-pin!”So why, in this holier life, so much fighting? Spenser Confidential is full of the stuff, I say. Wahlberg is confused – he wonders if I’m bringing this up because I’m English. “I keep trying to remember,” he says. “I don’t remember it being all that violent… Yeah he gets beat up a couple of times, but it’s not like he’s beating everybody up. He’s a relatable guy! He’s not some superhuman. But I know there’s a complete difference between what UK audiences find or deem violent versus the US.”I talk through some of the scenes, such as the one where about eight gangsters come at him with machetes and he despatches them all with his fists, before his friend drives a car through the restaurant wall. There’s the bunch of prisoners he hurls over furniture when they ambush him (one is played by the rapper Post Malone), the group of corrupt cops who beat him up, the woman who is murdered, her body thrown into a car boot – I could go on.“Right,” he says, still perplexed, “so there’s just a couple of fights?”If this is where he sets the bar, I’m starting to wonder if the number one Pomeranian on the ’gram, whom he does describe as violent, might actually have murdered several people.Yet he insists he’d be interested in a romcom, sure. “I’d be into it! But nothing with singing and dancing in it. I’m not doing a musical,” he says, firmly. “I’ve had to sing and dance more than I’ve wanted to… in films. And it’s my least favourite thing to do. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m not really self-conscious and I’m not scared to look vulnerable, or risk looking ridiculous, but I don’t know…” His voice goes very low, quiet, but there’s a grin in it. “I feel ridiculous when I’m dancing and singing.”So no more Marky Mark, and presumably he’s not going to do any more underwear modelling either. I ask if he ever made up with Kate Moss, who has said she hated working with him on the Calvin Klein shoots.Mark Wahlberg turns to properly face me. “I never really had a problem with Kate, did I?”She said she had a bad time. Does he remember it differently? “Well… bad time…” he repeats, questioningly, apparently unaware that what she actually told Vanity Fair was that she hated having to press her naked breasts against him, that he was unpleasant about her slender figure, and that she lay in bed for the next two weeks feeling like she was going to die.“I think I was probably a little rough around the edges. Kind of doing my thing,” he says, his eyes glinting mischievously at the memory of whatever his thing was. “I wasn’t very… worldly, let’s say that,” he says, laughing. “But I’ve seen her and said hello. I think we saw each other at a concert here and there, we said hi and exchanged pleasantries.”On the subject of women’s bodies, I bring up the fact that we’re in the Four Seasons, where many of the Harvey Weinstein accusations played out. When we meet, Weinstein has just been found guilty of two related charges in a New York court. I ask if everyone in LA is talking about it. “I’ve certainly been paying a lot of attention to what’s been going on with the criminal case and everything,” Wahlberg says. “There’s finally a lot of closure for a lot of people. But I don’t know, I’m so out of the loop with Hollywood.”Really? But you live right here, just down the road, and you work prolifically in the industry.“Yeah, but other than working, I go to the supermarket. I don’t go to dinner parties on the scene, or screenings. I live in Beverly Hills, but it could easily be the English countryside, because I don’t see anyone and I don’t do anything. I don’t go to awards unless I have a movie in them. I go to bed early, I get up early, I take my kids to school and I’m with my wife if I’m not I’m working.”I wonder if it’s strange raising these Beverly Hills children, who go to a privileged Catholic school and who’ve never known any other life. Wahlberg owns a chain of burger restaurants called, you guessed it, Wahlburgers – there is a branch in Covent Garden – and has investments in gyms, because of his passion for fitness, and other businesses. His personal wealth has been estimated at $250m.He says yes. “I don’t think any of my kids has ever been in a real fight,” he says. “Other than with each other. My son was into boxing for a while, and I was perfectly fine with that because there are disciplines to learn, and I think it’s one of the most difficult but most effective forms of exercise. But no, I didn’t think, like, ‘Oh my God, if something happens at school you can protect yourself’ – it’s not that kind of school.”When Mark and his brothers get together to retell old stories, Wahlberg’s kids “make fun of it, like, ‘oh God here we go, Dad and his street stories, whatever Dad.’ They’re not impressed. Well they don’t act impressed, that’s for sure.” The kids don’t even really like to watch movies with him in they prefer YouTube and TikTok – and hanging out with the Pomeranian pup, “who, it has to be said, brings them so much love. And joy.” He smiles – or is it a grimace? Hard to say.Spenser Confidential is out on Netflix now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee9d79e6e91ad5d50149bdaa4172a62691e86adb/0_39_1203_721/master/1203.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b88e25fffd68179db25315ebca5fa4d","title":"footballs rare pause for thought gives coaches time for inspiration","story":"Marton Bukovi showed his courage in wartime Zagreb but the Hungarian also rethought football tactics. Today’s coaches should use their layoff constructively“What did you do in the war, Mr Bukovi?” “I invented the false 9. What did you do?”That wasn’t all Marton Bukovi did during the second world war. The Hungarian coach – quite possibly the greatest tactical mind football has known – found himself in Zagreb, coaching Gradjanski, when the conflict began. When the Ustashe seized power and began enacting antisemitic legislation, his position became insecure, given he was the son of a Jewish father and a Catholic mother. He, in as much as religion bothered him at all, seems to have identified as Christian, and there is a cross on his gravestone in the Rakoskeresztur cemetery in Budapest, but his wife, Aranka Klein, was Jewish and at least one of his sisters was a practising Jew.Bukovi not only kept working but also helped protect the club’s groundsman, a Jewish refugee called Max Reisfeld who had fled Nazi Vienna, taking food and provisions to him and his family as they hid under a stand at the stadium where, for four years, they remained undetected and survived.Bukovi was courageous and a man of firm principle but he was also notoriously difficult. He had his habits and was rarely minded to change them. He loved the cinema and would go every day after training, but he hated being distracted so would turn up at the box office, ask if his wife were there and, if she were, he would go on to a different cinema.“He was a hard man,” said Marika Lantos, whose husband, Mihaly, later worked as Bukovi’s assistant at Olympiakos. “Precise, strict and consistent. He demanded order and discipline. It didn’t matter who a player was he would always tell him what he thought of him. That might be why many didn’t love him. He could be reserved and grumpy but he had a heart of gold. He was like a bad mother-in-law: he commented on everything and always found fault. He meant well, but he couldn’t understand that he needed to make distinctions between people. He just said what he wanted to say.”But then he was a genius, and geniuses perhaps are allowed some leeway with the social graces. When the war in Yugoslavia was over and the Communists were in control, the clubs who had played in the fascist league were disbanded and, in many cases, had their archives destroyed. Gradjanski, eventually, were reborn as Dinamo and Bukovi was persuaded to become manager.The interim had given him time to think. He had already overseen Gradjanski’s transition from a 2-3-5 to the W-M formation but what, he wondered, if you went further? What if you withdrew the centre-forward so deep he was almost a midfielder, gave your inside-forwards licence and pulled one of the wing-halves so deep he was in effect a second central defender, turning the 3-2-2-3 of W-M into something very close to 4-2-4?And so, in 1946, in the game against Lokomotiva that would decide the Zagreb championship, Bukovi put his theory into practice.Gradjanski won and Bukovi was vindicated – not that he was entirely happy. “Dragutin Hripko played the role,” he said. “He played it closer to well than to poorly, but far from ideally. As a footballer he never achieved great quality, but I always spoke about him when asked about a withdrawn striker. He was my lab rat … I can clearly remember how the Lokomotiva players didn’t know how to handle him.”Bukovi took the system with him when he returned to Budapest and by 1952 Hungary were using it to win Olympic gold, part of a four-year unbeaten run – in which they twice hammered a befuddled England – that ended with defeat by West Germany in the 1954 World Cup final.Managers rarely get time to think. The churn of games, the routine of training, of the day-to-day dealing with players is too much. But now, during a shutdown that will last at least a couple of months, managers do have time. Football is a mature game now: huge developmental steps such as Bukovi’s are unlikely. Everything happens by increments. But what is possible? What might an enlightened manager do having been given this long period without the immediate pressure of games?Elite-level football tends to move forward by solutions. A team is successful playing in a particular way and so a means must be found to interrupt that. The possession-heavy game of Pep Guardiola and his imitators was eventually overcome by the high-energy, highly focused press and transition game of Jürgen Klopp – to the extent that Guardiola has begun to change.That makes sense: the way to defeat possession football is to work out a way of disrupting those patterns of passing and regaining the ball better.So what comes next? How do you disrupt a pressing game? One way is simply to pass the ball better, in less predictable patterns. Perhaps if Guardiola’s Barcelona of 2008-11 were still around, still at their peak and still with the dribbling potency of Lionel Messi, that would be possible (it may be that what passed was less their stylistic hegemony than simply the peak of that side). But given it is not, and given the seeming impossibility of that aim, how else could hard-pressing football be circumvented?An obvious way, which Guardiola briefly took against Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund in a German cup game, is to go over the press. Guardiola used Javi Martínez as his target man, but perhaps target men in general are due a comeback. What better way to thwart a well-deployed pressing line than by whacking it long and early at a Niall Quinn or a Joe Jordan or a Nat Lofthouse, particularly if they could be supported by a rapid poacher? How better to unsettle two central defenders picked less for their marking and battling qualities than their positioning and passing than by making them defend against a pair?Or perhaps not. But in this time of enforced inaction, it’s perhaps worth managers asking, what would Marton Bukovi do?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0979673889705d04a0d28ae8b7805132a11ab6e2/169_201_3331_1999/master/3331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41ff21b93d9ee51a2f53fcf3cb11b10b","title":"football faces endless conundrums when the game finally restarts","story":"The coronavirus crisis has instilled a spirit of unity among football’s leaders – but the sport’s calendar has been shreddedAs Gareth Southgate put it so eloquently, this is hardly the moment for football to take centre stage. Yet after a week in which almost all of the sport’s global calendar was suspended amid the growing coronavirus pandemic, England’s manager can be forgiven for wondering if what Pelé described as the “beautiful game” will ever recover from this crisis.Thursday’s joint announcement by the Football Association, the Premier League and the EFL that the provisional date of the first weekend in April for the resumption of men’s and women’s professional football had been pushed back almost a month until “no earlier than 30 April” confirmed the worst for many clubs and supporters in Britain.Less than seven days after Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta was diagnosed with coronavirus, prompting the initial postponement of the Premier League programme the following morning, the entire football industry in Britain has been plunged into turmoil as staff scramble to find a way of plugging the gaps left by the loss of match-day revenue, income that becomes more critical the further you go down the pyramid.Faced with the threat of Covid-19 sweeping across Europe, football’s authorities had little choice but to shut down all domestic competitions, although the government was initially slow to act and last weekend’s National League fixtures were somehow still allowed to take place. “The reason it went ahead is because whoever sits on the board of the National League just cared about the money. Simple as that,” said the Eastleigh manager, Ben Strevens, after his side’s 4-0 defeat at Notts County played out in front of 4,942 supporters. “They didn’t think about the wellbeing of the spectators, and it’s not only the supporters: we’ve got a kitman who is an old boy, and there’s stewards who are older. They’re the ones that are most at risk. There’s no way whatsoever these games should have been played.”Thousands of junior matches up and down the country were also played last weekend but it was not until Monday that the FA finally acted by issuing a statement “advising that all grassroots football in England is postponed for the foreseeable future”. That was in line with the government’s recommendation for people to avoid social contact and gatherings where possible. By contrast, those measures were introduced in France and Germany on Thursday 12 March, the same day Uefa announced that the following week’s Manchester City v Real Madrid and Juventus v Lyon Champions League second legs were postponed.When Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi was among those to test positive for Covid-19 on 13 March, Uefa swiftly confirmed that all the remaining Champions League and Europa League matches scheduled to take place this past week had been postponed.On Tuesday the Norwegian Football Association confirmed on Twitter, after an emergency video conference involving European football’s governing body and major stakeholders, including all 55 national FAs, that Euro 2020 would have to wait until next summer. It had long been inevitable.“We are at the helm of a sport that vast numbers of people live and breathe that has been laid low by this invisible and fast-moving opponent,” said Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin. “It is at times like these, that the football community needs to show responsibility, unity, solidarity and altruism.”The decision to delay their quadrennial showpiece tournament – which generated almost £2bn for Uefa when it was hosted by France in 2016 – was clear recognition that there was no other option. With the finals spread across 12 cities from Dublin to Baku, it remains to be seen whether the current format can be retained in 2021 despite officials insisting not much will change. We have still yet to discover the fate of the 2021 women’s tournament that was scheduled to be held in England next summer, with the first match at Old Trafford on 7 July.Uefa has said it will announce the new dates in due course but Ceferin hinted that the preferred option may be to hold the tournament in 2022. “Yes, that’s one of the possibilities, one of the most likely to happen,” he said. “I don’t think that we should cannibalise the women’s Euro with the men’s Euro just one month before.”As well as the final, on 12 July, Wembley is due to host both semi-finals of the rescheduled men’s Euros next year, so there will be logistical concerns about holding another tournament in the same country so soon afterwards.New dates must also be found for the men’s under-21s tournament due to take place in Slovenia and Hungary, plus the Nations League finals, but Uefa has at least given clubs a window in which to complete their domestic leagues and European competitions should the situation allow.Its president even expressed hope that the new spirit of cooperation could be here to stay after praising the swiftness with which his Fifa counterpart, Gianni Infantino – usually a sworn enemy – had acted to deal with the crisis by ensuring that the whole football world acts accordingly. “There is no more time for egotistic ideas,” Ceferin said. “There is no more time for selfishness. This is a reset of world football.”Time will tell on that front. When life does eventually return to normal, however, the challenge of finishing hundreds of league and cup programmes around the continent – not to mention the Champions League and Europa League – will be seismic.The “commitment to complete all domestic and European club competitions by the end of the current sporting season, ie 30 June” that was signed by Uefa and most of Europe’s domestic leagues also recognised that it may mean “possible limitations or drops of current exclusive calendar slots, potentially resulting in the scheduling of domestic league matches in midweek and scheduling of Uefa club competitions matches on weekends”.The Premier League’s announcement on Thursday followed suit, with the prospect of games being held being closed doors if necessary believed to be among the plans under consideration. Concerns over the expiration of many players’ contracts on 30 June make it highly desirable that the season be over by then, although contingency measures including clubs offering temporary extensions to out-of-contract players or those on loan deals are also understood to be under discussion.There is one relatively isolated country in Europe, though, where football goes on oblivious to the rest of the continent’s travails. The new season in Belarus began on Thursday, despite 51 reported cases of coronavirus in the former Soviet satellite. “There is no critical situation. So we decided that we are starting the championship in a timely manner. Today,” said Vladimir Bazanov, chairman of the Football Federation of Belarus. “We have no prerequisites for this yet. We have no panic. The situation in the country is not such that we need to stop everything. Why escalate the situation?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b1bb9cc7441400a1521055234c05a56ce7570b7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=986794c5f597c1c567935eebfd27ef87","title":"there is no greater pleasure than eating with my family what makes you smile","story":"For some, it’s remembering when they first met their partner, while for others it’s their dog that causes them to beam, says Kate Leahy. What’s the secret to making you grin?From a big beam to the littlest lift at the corners of your mouth, smiling is infectious in the best possible way. Which is happy news, as new research shows smiling can really improve our mood, spurring a chemical reaction in our brains. As adults, we smile 20-40 times a day – finding joy in small moments that matter is as important as taking care of your teeth and gums. Here, six people share what makes them smile.Hazel Gardiner, 41, floral artist“My dog, Ringo, has made me smile from the moment we met. He was the puppy in a lively litter of goldendoodles who came straight over, desperate to be near me. Ringo is really loving but has some funny quirks. He’s not scared of lightning, but if he sees a luggage trolley he freaks out. He’s also a ball stealer at the park. He can hold three in his mouth, so you need an extra ball to get him to drop them. There have been times when I’ve walked him in the morning and been late for work because he won’t drop someone else’s ball. Now, we take five with us just in case. If I’m working on my laptop, Ringo will nudge my hand with his nose for a cuddle. I’m smiling just thinking about him. I’ve made it my mission to look after my teeth and, as a result, I’m a big smiler.”Sukhi Wahiwala, 45, small business coach“In the Sikh faith we believe that, at a certain point, the roles reverse and children look after their parents. Sadly, a year ago, my mother passed away. Helping my father deal with the loss after 65 years of marriage has been challenging, but positive too. My four children call him Papaji. Because we’re so close, each one of us has been able to be a part of my mum for him. I’m my father’s sounding board. I love listening to stories from his youth. We often talk about my mum’s encyclopedic knowledge and we laugh when I prompt him in the same way she would, bringing his memory back to life.”Nick Gaskell, 35, mortgage adviser“I’ve always struggled with my teeth. I have weak gums from lack of brushing as a child, and my two front teeth cross over. Now I pay serious attention to cleaning my teeth thoroughly and I smile with more confidence. And it shows when I’m doing what I love – gardening. My girlfriend and I recently bought a flat in a mansion block in north London, complete with an overgrown garden. Suddenly, I’m that person who watches gardening tutorials on YouTube, invests in fairy lights and visits the garden centre at the weekend. Now I look out of my kitchen window and see lavender, pieris and my favourite blue hydrangea. There’s a huge sense of achievement.”Christine Brown, 59, housing officer“My oldest daughter had lots of allergies as a child, so I’ve always made everything from scratch since then. Food is a big part of our family life. I find cooking very therapeutic, but there is no greater pleasure in the world than sitting down to eat with my family and seeing their faces light up.”Mariatu Turay-Akar, 42, owner of fashion brand Gitas Portal“I feel so fortunate that my marriage is still, after 20 years and five children, full of love and constant laughter. We’re playful together he makes me feel young. I often forget I’m in my 40s. Remembering when we met brings me joy – though, actually, I wasn’t interested at first. I assumed that we wouldn’t have much in common, but he turned out to be the most witty, charming man, and loves the theatre – just like I do. I smile most when I’m around him.”Keri Tebbit, 32, course development manager“When my four-year-old daughter first saw my braces, she said: ‘Wow!’ like they were the coolest thing ever.

Each recipe would work well alongside your Easter lunch, keeping you cosy inside while looking out at that inevitable spring rain.Rhubarb is one of the only spring fruits, so I love to look to the tropics at this time of year for a little variety: passionfruit, papaya, tonka, vanilla and coconut. I sliced my hand open trying to prize the meat from a young coconut while testing these recipes, so to spare you a trip to A\u0026ampE I have opted for coconut flakes in my tropical twist on a hot cross bun.Papaya is usually seen on the breakfast table, but this is a shame. It’s perfect for pavlova with a slightly tart crème fraîche cream. The chocolate fondant cake is the most incredible recipe that takes 30 minutes from start to finish. It’s flourless, too, so it’s good for Passover. I use tonka, but vanilla works just as well.The best papaya are the ripe larger, long ones you often find split in half. Makes 6For the meringues: eggwhites 3 salt ¼ tsp vanilla extract 1 tbsp white caster sugar 200g For the cream and fruit topping: double cream 200ml crème fraîche 100ml papaya ½ a long one limes 2, juice and zest honey 100g, runnyPreheat the oven to 110Cgas mark ¼. Line a tray with baking paper.With an electric mixer, beat the eggwhites, salt and vanilla on a high speed until soft peaks form.Whisk half of the sugar into the eggwhites. Whisk until very stiff and then add the remaining sugar mixture. Whisk until smooth and glossy.Use two large spoons to portion out the batter about 4cm apart on to the prepared baking sheet, making a depression in the centre of each one with the back of the spoon. Bake for about 2 hours. Remove from the oven. Transfer the meringues off the baking tray and on to a cooling rack right away to cool completely.Remove the seeds from the middle of the papaya and turn over so the hollow part is facing down. Using a paring knife or peeler, remove the skin from the papaya. Slice into 12 half moons. Zest the limes into a bowl and set aside.Whip the cream and crème fraîche together to soft peaks.Place the meringues on to inidual plates and cover with a couple of slices of papaya and a generous squeeze of lime. Spoon a large dollop of cream on top of the papaya and drizzle with about 1 tbsp of honey and sprinkle some zest over the top to finish. Serve right away.This cake is a miracle. It takes minutes to prepare, minutes to bake and is so rich and decadent it really impresses friends.Heat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6. Grease and line a 20cm loose-bottom or spring-form cake tin with parchment paper.Melt the chocolate and butter with the salt and grated tonka bean in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir occasionally, but not vigorously. Once the butter and chocolate has melted, remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool briefly in a draught-free area. Slowly whisk in the sifted cocoa powder.In an electric stand mixer, whip the eggwhites and sugar together until soft glossy peaks form. Fold the eggwhites into the melted chocolate mixture until just combined there should be a slight marble effect.Pour the mixture into your prepared cake tin and sprinkle with 1 tbsp of caster sugar before baking.Bake for 10 minutes note that the cake will still be a little wobbly when you remove it from the oven.Allow the cake to cool for 10 minutes then turn out on to a serving plate. When plating, you can use a serving spoon or a cake slice – the scoops or slices won’t be perfect as the cake has a gooey texture. Serve immediately with crème fraîche.Seek out heavier, plump-looking fruit for the most juice and pulp inside. It’s good warm, but also keeps well for days.For the cake: unsalted butter 250g softened, plus more for greasing the tin golden caster sugar 250g eggs 4 Greek yogurt 220g oranges 2, zest and juice passionfruit 4, pulp and seeds plain flour 500g baking powder 1 ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda 1 tsp vanilla bean paste 1 tsp salt ½ tsp For the drizzle:passionfruit juice of 2, seeds sieved icing sugar 150gPreheat the oven to 170Cgas mark 3, and grease and line a 900g loaf tin with parchment paper and set aside (a standard 900g loaf tin is around 23 x 13 x 7cm).Use an electric stand mixer or handheld mixer to beat the butter and sugar together until light and creamy. Add the orange zest and juice, the passionfruit and the vanilla paste. Beat until combined.Add the eggs one at a time and mix until incorporated, then fold in the yogurt.In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, bicarb and salt. Add half of this to the egg mixture and fold and then add the remaining flour and fold in again until combined.Pour the mixture into your prepared tin and bake for 45-50 minutes or until a skewer inserted comes out clean.Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 15 minutes before removing from the pan and transferring to a serving plate.Prepare the drizzle by whisking the passionfruit juice and icing sugar together until smooth. Spoon the drizzle all over the top of the cake and allow it to drip down the sides. Serve straight away with Greek yogurt or allow to cool before storing in an airtight container.Amazing warm, fresh out of the oven, their glaze melting in your mouth.

Isolation is bad for a species addicted to social intercourse.My solution has been to start a cocktail hour on a video conferencing site, sending one or two friends every day an invitation to drinks in front of their laptop (or phone) at a time when we might normally meet in a pub or at each other’s homes. It’s surprising what a difference it can make to a day of isolation, and to your spirits in general, to see your friends’ faces in the evening and hear them talk and laugh.The scale of Covid-19 and what it’s doing to us is very worrying, but an hour with different friends every evening really helps reduce anxiety, and of course you can make much more effort than I do – dress up, light candles, provide nibbles (crisps make too much noise). Whatever joy is released when you see your pals in the flesh is also present in these video cocktails, and the beautiful thing is that for a small charge the host gets unlimited conference calls (I pay £110 annually for BlueJeans) and guests pay nothing.Clearly, this can be expanded to talking to neighbours you may not know very well, or people you believe are really suffering from enforced isolation and loneliness. It may even be a good way of meeting people. Each participant might invite a person no one else knows. It’s certainly great for new mothers, book clubs, football supporters – anyone who is missing out on regular contact.Despite the remoteness of the interaction and the occasional annoyances of the technology, I find that people really talk in the video cocktail hour. Maybe that has something to do with the ambiguity of the interaction – you are neither alone nor really in company. You are half-way between the two and perhaps that makes you more candid.Sites I have used include Zoom, BlueJeans and Whypay? And my daughter has just introduced me to the Houseparty app.Alice Vincent, urban gardening columnist and authorI genuinely think gardening is what will keep us sane through this. It connects us with the outdoors and the gentle satisfaction of watching things grow brings a unique positivity. If you’ve no garden, there are plenty of ways to grow indoors.You’ll need a sunny windowsill, inside or out. I always advise beginners to grow herbs. They’re easy and delicious – and when supermarket supplies are low they become increasingly worthwhile. The plastic trays that tomatoes and mushrooms come in will do – just make some holes in the bottom for drainage.Fill with, ideally, peat-free multipurpose compost (most nurseries deliver and will be grateful for the custom). Parsley and basil rub along happily next to one another, but mint’s a bit of a thug and better in its own pot. You can also chuck in some salad leaf seeds: pea shoots, rocket and nasturtiums germinate quickly and are tasty at any point in their growing cycle. Sow according to packet instructions: you’ll need a fraction of what’s in the packet.Keep the soil moist – an old spray bottle is perfect for this – before and after shoots appear. If youharvest no more than a third of the plant at a time, all should bounce back.Justin Jacobs, manager, Equinox fitness clubsWe are creatures of habit in what we eat, when we work, what TV shows we watch. Right now, all those habits have been shoved out of the window. There’s a lot of confusion, but this is an opportunity to create new habits. So what to try? What’s your new routine? It may be fluid and can change, but what do you want to try?There’s lots of great online content available. Equinox’s Furthermore platform offers a variety of workouts, but search the web to find a trainer or teacher you like and trust. John Berardi, a nutritionist I work with, is often asked, “What’s the best vegetable to eat?” His answer is that it’s the vegetable you like and will eat regularly. Exercise is the same.There is a run on home gym equipment right now, but dumbbells, ropes and other useful products are still available online. Choose what’s right for your space. I’ve just ordered some competition kettlebells because they’re something I really enjoy.There’s copious anecdotal and scientific evidence showing how important fitness is for mental health: so during this very stressful time, it’s even more important. It also boosts the immune system.But exercise isn’t just about health – it’s often a social activity, too. I’m using FaceTime more than ever before because I’m not having regular social contact. Work out with a friend on FaceTime or have an online dance party with your family. Last night I watched a band I like called Sofi Tukker DJ live on Instagram. That was a new experience. Find something like that and dance for half an hour and your cardio will be done.Jack Monroe, food writer and activistIn times of food scarcity and uncertainty, we have to make do with what we have. I haven’t been so much panic-buying – not having a car limits that – but I have been guiltily hoovering up scraps from the reduced cabinet late in the day, to save them being discarded. This week’s haul included three boxes of chestnut mushrooms, a withered bunch of wild garlic and a pile of French purple garlic, a little battered around the edges.I will dry the mushrooms, peel and pickle the garlic cloves, and knock the wild garlic with some nuts into a sauce aillade. This will keep for a month past the sell-by date that consigned it to the bargain bin in the first place. Preserving food is not going get us too far in a pandemic, admittedly, but pickling what we have now is an investment in future dinners. I am also pickling a slow cooker’s worth of dried white beans in oil and vinegar, to use until tinned ones come back into stock.400g dried cannellini beans½ a small onion100g frozen peppers80ml vinegar – red, white or cider1 tbsp white sugar100ml oil (any)Drain and rinse your beans, then pop them in a pan of cold water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes then drain thoroughly then return to the pan.Add the onions and peppers, along with the vinegar, sugar and oil. Thoroughly clean and sterilise a large jar and its lid. Bring the pan to the boil very carefully. Do not take your eyes off it for a moment as you are dealing with hot oil, which poses a fire risk if unattended. As soon as bubbles start to form, remove it from the heat immediately.Allow to cool for a minute, stirring well, then pour into the sterilised jar, filling it as full as possible. Turn the jar upside down and allow to cool completely before placing in the fridge. Resist sampling them for at least seven days, as the flavour will develop in this time.In a clean and sterile jar, these can keep for a few months unopened. Once opened, use within a week.Laura de Barra, ‘She’-I-Y expert and authorIf you want to use this time it to zhuzh up your home, start with paint. Consider the space and think about what mood you want works best. If you want your kitchen to give you a little lift each morning, go for light, bright tones. Avoid mistakes: that shade that looks gorgeous on the tin (or on Instagram), can look less appealing on walls with less natural light or in a different-sized room, so swatching is key.Test multiple swatches on every wall. Paint dries to a different shade, so don’t be freaked out. Walk away and come back when it’s fully dry before considering how it looks. If you’ll need two coats, do two coats when you swatch. Pay attention to how the colour is affected by light at the times you use the room most.When it comes to painting a wall, use a brush to “cut in” first. This means painting the corners and edges before anything else – it gives a better finish. Rollers are ideal for large areas and easier on the hands. Make sure you have the correct roller for the surface – check with your paint supplier.I favour water-based paint – it doesn’t trap moisture, it’s kinder to the environment and the clean-up is easier. Also, while modern satin and sheen paint finishes are great, consider a matt paint in an older home: it won’t bounce light from any dents and imperfections. C’est bon!Laura de Barra is author of Gaff Goddess (Penguin, £14.99)John-Paul Flintoff, writer and crafterTen years ago, to be kinder to the planet, I took up mending clothes. I knee-patched jeans, darned jumpers and, before you could say “treadle-powered Singer sewing machine”, I had bought one and started making things from scratch. I shirted and trousered myself, and with knitting needles I socked and jumpered. I learned crochet so I could make Y-fronts using nettle fibre. (We’ll all be wearing nettle when the cotton stops, so plant it now. And relax: the fibre doesn’t sting.)Did people laugh? Well, it was meant to be funny. But not only funny. Like any activity that involves applying your mind to the physical universe, sewing is meditative. It puts you in the here and now.Gradually I set aside the angst that had got me started and started sewing for pleasure. Hoping others might follow, I let my repairs show themselves off, using thread of contrasting colours to edge holes in a jumper, and to stitch the slogan “Fresh Air Machine” on the back.I published a book about all this, initially as a limited series of hand-bound books I stitched together, with bits of cereal box and old shirts for the cover. (Better than it sounds.) This, too, was meditative work.If you want to have a go, try darning something. (Look at YouTube.) Cut something up and use it to patch something else. Learn different stitches (for different effects), and experiment by combining materials. Using embroidery, write your name on your shirt or give it a luxury brand logo: it will make you smile, and might give joy to others.John-Paul Flintoff’s book is Sew Your Own (Profile Books, available on Kindle, £6.40)Dawn Isaac, garden designer and author After three children and eight years of “screen-free family Sundays”, I have plenty of ideas for entertaining children at home. First, get comfortable with mess. Kids having fun do not keep things neat. Manage the chaos with a “tidy-up half-hour” for everyone before they go to bed. Also give the kids some control – they’re always more willing to throw themselves into things if they feel it was at least partly their idea. Let them lead: help them gather material for junk modelling, a fashion show or house construction, but resist getting too involved. Their imaginations are better than yours.On day one of any long stretch with the kids, we make a “boredom buster”. Take a large jar and lots of squares of paper. On each, one, write an activity everyone can do – play a board game, make a milkshake. Whenever anyone says “I’m bored”, you pick an activity from the jar. The only rule is you all have to do it before you pick another.To add an element of trepidation, slip some chores into the jar: clean your room, empty the dishwasher. That way, the jar won’t be empty by the end of day two, and the house might not look as if a bomb has hit it.Anything out of the ordinary is always more fun. If it’s mealtime, why not have a picnic on the carpet rather than sitting at the table? If they want to run a cafe and serve the family lunch, or set up a library, let them have a go. Just don’t expect perfection – they’re still apprentices.Dawn Isaac’s book, 101 Things for Kids to do Screen-Free (Octopus, £14.99), is published on 6 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f177465a32de8d6baae112d2d61c28cf3649a1b/0_180_5055_3033/master/5055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a5ad39dfd7a14fc38dcb6c4d0e02c91","title":"family isolation guide for parents teenagers coronavirus lockdown","story":"Staying at home will put a huge strain on children and teenagers but, say psychologists, there are ways to use family lockdown as an opportunityIt has been a busy week for adolescent therapist Alicia Drummond. As soon as the government announced schools were closing, parents and teachers started begging her for advice about teenagers cut adrift from their friends, life goals and daily routines. “There’s suddenly a massive demand from parents wanting to know what to do.”She is hosting a webinar this week on “parenting in isolation” via her website, teentips, and says the first 10 spaces sold out in five minutes. “Parents are really worried – and I’ve had schools on the phone saying: ‘Please can you do something on how to cope with everyone being at home.’”Couples have also been consulting marriage counsellor Deborah Parker on how they can both work from home, with their children in the house all day, and not end up in the orce courts. “Something I’ve been discussing with couples is that this particular unprecedented scenario is very much teetering on either explosion or irreparable damage within a family. Or, the collectiveness of the family will actually help heal all those times of tiredness and stress, when couples don’t see each other and have grown apart.”For this reason, it’s vital parents are realistic about the hours they can work from home while their kids are off school. “Couples should concentrate first and foremost on their children,” says Parker. “If work takes precedence, then children often feel ignored or unappreciated. That can lead to adverse behaviour, negative feedback and playing up … and daily life for couples can become just too overwhelming.”To ease these tensions, she recommends parents work in shifts, taking turns to supervise the children, and set aside time to chat and listen to each other’s concerns each day, in a room away from the kids.Nerys Hughes, clinical director of Whole Child Therapy, acknowledges that creating a routine for children is important. But she warns parents against taking on the role of their child’s teacher if it causes conflict, not least because stress hormones can make people more susceptible to a viral infection. “Your number one job as a parent at the moment is to keep your children well and that means looking after their mental health as well as their physical health,” she says.Instead of worrying that children are not doing enough schoolwork, parents should view the enforced break as an opportunity for some child-led, inidualised learning, which most schools struggle to offer. “I would say to the child: let’s write down all the different things that you could use this time to learn, do and experience. Then every morning, ask them to put a schedule together, made up of those things,” says Hughes.Children and teenagers should also be allowed a few “duvet days” where they can do whatever they want. That way, they may be more willing to take a structured educational approach on other days – and, for example, learn a new skill. “You could say to them: you are so lucky. You are one of the few year groups ever to get this opportunity. How are you going to use it?” says Drummond. Teens may not yet have twigged that, in the future, universities or employers will be asking them how they spent their time off.Hughes predicts that the three main things that children are going to miss are their usual routine, their chance to connect with their community and their opportunities to be successful and accomplish things. “We need roles, identity and productivity, even from the age of three.”One way parents can help even young children to feel productive while they are at home is to enable them to help out with housework or cooking. “It doesn’t matter if the accomplishment is curriculum-based. It can be learning to make mum a cup of tea, putting pasta in a bowl or drawing a picture for someone so they feel connected to the people they are missing. Even if that gift never gets given, because you are self-isolating, the child has felt that moment of connection.”Teenagers in particular may miss their friends terribly and, due to their adolescent brains, feel invincible and omnipotent in the face of the virus, warns Drummond. “They’re wired for experimentation, without the ability to weigh up long-term outcomes.” Because they may impulsively decide to take risks, it’s worth explaining why guidelines need to be followed.“My rule of thumb with parenting teenagers is: ask, don’t tell. So ask them: why do you think we’re isolating? What do you think the ramifications of you meeting up with your friends might be?” If they do sneak out, don’t turn it into a big drama.“Instead, reiterate why it’s important that they don’t do it again.”Whatever happens, don’t try to try to punish your teen by taking away their tech. “What we have to be deeply careful of is not letting them become too isolated. We all know that isolation has an impact on people’s mental health, and that’s particularly true for adolescents.” Encourage them to stay connected to their friends virtually, in a healthy way, rather than going out and putting other people at risk.It’s also important to keep children informed about matters in the wider world that affect them, says Parker. “Often, children prefer to be told what is going on than to be suddenly given the shocking news that grandma’s passed away because she got the virus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d476bdcee215038ec2307a703ac225e17a514155/349_352_5583_3351/master/5583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c71f2ad883cc6603351238fd96f8bf3e","title":"why mothers day is so tough for my family this year","story":"My mother and I both lost our husbands recently, but the coronavirus epidemic means we must grieve apartMy mother and I, both widowed just weeks ago and only 41 days apart, have quickly come to dread the well-meaning words: “How are you?”. Semaphored by a telltale tilt of the concerned head before they are even spoken, they force us to contemplate the thing that anyway lodges like a stone in our stomachs and drags on our every step.And what answer should we give? That we are doing our best to adjust to our bleak new realities? In the age of coronavirus, realities change by the hour. The friends and family who rushed to embrace us after we lost our beautiful boys now keep a responsible distance, especially from my mother, who is 86. The government advises over-70s to stay home and shun visitors. My mother, alone for the first time in her life, oppressed by the weight of “sadmin” and new to the technologies that offer virtual connections, could scarcely be more isolated in her self-isolation. This is why today, exceptionally, is one that we will spend together, at a two metre distance and without hugs. Happy Mother’s Day.In so doing, we play to the stereotype that currently infests social media, of entitled elders endangering wider society by resisting public health advice. Mainstream media is just as dismissive. Italy’s high death toll from Covid-19 is explained away by journalists as a consequence of its ageing population in terms that ignore the value and vibrancy of older citizens.Writing in the , its assistant editor, Jeremy Warner, suggested that “from an entirely disinterested economic perspective, the Covid-19 might even prove mildly beneficial in the long term by disproportionately culling elderly dependents”.Such a cull will not be purely a function of biology. In January, I watched as the brilliant ICU nurses and doctors at St Thomas’s hospital battled in vain to save my 64-year-old husband while extending the same extraordinary level of care to patients who were significantly older, as well as to the chronically sick and the disabled. In failing adequately to invest in the NHS, successive governments have condemned its workforce to contemplate a system of triage that may force them to give more attention to some patients than others, as ICUs are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers suffering complications from the new virus. Those viewed as less viable, less valuable, by society are right to fear for their chances under such a system.Covid-19 is laying bare inequalities like nothing in my lifetime, yet too few see this picture as they attend meetings of Boris Johnson’s all-male war cabinet (average age 46.6 years). Where is the understanding of the different gendered impacts of the crisis in an economy sustained by the unpaid labour of women? Which of those affluent men can speak to the experience of being told to self-isolate when home is a place of abuse or hardship?How am I, you ask. Well, I’m scared not for myself but of further loss, and I’m angry and I’m determined to see some good come out of this misery. So please, let’s ask questions – and make them the right ones. Some are urgent, such as “How can I help?”, a hashtag I’ve been using on Twitter and Facebook to link those self-isolating with people able to run errands for them. This comes garlanded with additional questions about safeguarding and bolstering – rather than impeding – existing organisations and authorities engaged in these efforts. Many of us are also looking at ways to create free content and community for those in isolation two organisations I co-founded, the Women’s Equality Party and Primadonna festival, are separately concentrating efforts on this. As the crisis develops, and while the prime minister continues to forswear clarity of policy in favour of Churchill impressions –that’s Churchill the Dog (“Oh yes. We can lick this virus in 12 weeks”) – those of us who are not key workers may find that the most helpful thing we can do is to stay home and avoid panic buying.Yet staying home does not and cannot mean withdrawing from the debate. If we care about shaping a better post-pandemic world, we must scrutinise measures taken to combat the emergency and prepare to rise, an army of keyboard warriors, if they threaten democracy or a deepening of the social and economic isions that have left us so ill-prepared and badly led.We must ask questions, too, about the wisdom of pursuing economic growth driven by global consumerism, no matter the environmental cost – and as air pollution declines because of efforts to stem the spread of coronavirus, it should be clear that every environmental cost is a human cost.Let us ask the right questions, too, about the value we ascribe to each other. A good starting point would be to look afresh at older women, so often underestimated, belittled in popular culture and short-changed by a pensions system that not only refuses to acknowledge the cumulative effect of the gender pay gap but actively penalises women for taking time out to provide the unpaid caring on which our society relies. This much older women have in common but theirs is a erse population, with valuable skills, wisdom and perspectives.My mother may never get to grips with tech (though I’m confident she will), but there are women of her age writing code and others, scientists and medical staff, rejoining the workforce to combat Covid-19.My mother has never stopped working, most recently as a self-employed theatre publicist. She could tell this government about the hit to freelancers and to the arts from the crisis. She could tell them about unpaid labour too.For the last three years of my stepfather’s life, she was his carer, a tiny woman somehow managing to manoeuvre him around London in his wheelchair so that he could enjoy the time he had left. She is amazing, as so many older women are. I say again: Happy Mother’s Day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def9a56a074c9f346baa56704924234d4a826523/0_301_4851_2910/master/4851.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a85883737ea0cf002185650a7f6e77b","title":"coronavirus consumer q and a lost weddings acts of god","story":"The outbreak is still causing huge confusion for consumers. We sift the facts from some of the fictionMy brother booked his wedding and reception at the Vu in Bathgate for 5 June. Now with guests cancelling on them because of the virus, they have asked if they can postpone the event until 2021 or 2022. He’s been told that they can’t and will forfeit the full fee if they cancel. He’s currently out of work because of the pandemic and has a newborn baby, so they can ill afford this.AG, LondonHappily for him the Vu has now changed its policy and is offering couples with weddings booked from now until the end of June the chance to postpone without charge to a suitable date in 2020-21. However, it’s still hosting weddings for as long as gatherings are permitted by the Scottish government. This is the kind of crisis wedding insurance is for, but couples who have not already bought a policy may find they are too late. A number of firms have announced they will not accept any new applications. Even those who have a policy may only be covered if their wedding is cancelled for actual infection rather than fear of infection, and some insurers specifically exclude cover for law changes that affect the big day. That means a future government ban on large groups would not qualify policyholders for a refund.I am 60 and not yet retired. I have a pension pot from previous employment that has fallen by £8,000 this week to £64,000. Is four years enough time for it to recover from this and further slides? Or is there sense in converting to annuities?DM, ManchesterIt’s certainly alarming to watch investments in freefall, but pension schemes do factor in financial volatility. Many schemes move funds into less risky options such as gilts and bonds as customers near retirement, which means they will take less of a hit than stock market investments. You should check to see what type of funds your pension is invested in.It’s those who invested their retirement nest egg privately who may have to postpone retirement until markets recover, or resign themselves to a reduced income, according to Charlotte Jackson, head of pension operations and consumer protection at the Money and Pensions Service.It’s crucial to get independent advice before rushing into anything, however desperate the headlines. You can call the Pension Advisory Service on 0800 011 3797 or book a free appointment to discuss your options with Pension Wise. Usually, face-to-face discussions of up to an hour are offered, but in the current climate it will have to be by phone.If someone has life insurance and dies of Covid-19, will the policy pay out, or will this be classed as an “Act of God” and exempt the insurer.SQ, Epsom, SurreyAn understandable question since insurers are notorious for passing the buck to the Almighty when it comes to natural disasters. If you have already taken out the policy you will almost certainly be OK, since most cover infectious diseases. However, the coronavirus outbreak has triggered panic buying of life insurance and anyone still at the application stage will probably find the ground has shifted. Premiums are calculated according to your health and medical history, so any underlying conditions which put you particularly at risk may cost you more – or cause your application to be rejected. You may also be asked about your recent travels.We have just moved out of our rented flat, which was then professionally cleaned. On the last day of our tenancy my partner developed a cough and so we are now following government advice to self-isolate. Our landlord is asking that we foot the bill for a further deep clean and to pay for the new tenants to spend a night in a hotel. I am a bit surprised at this. Viruses aren’t mentioned in our tenancy agreement.RH, CroydonYou can bet they will be after this. Since no one saw this coming, we’re in uncharted territory and making up the rules as we go along. The lettings agency trade body Arla Propertymark reckons you should foot the bill. “The tenants have been prevented from moving in to their new home due to no fault of their own, or the landlords. Therefore, they need to be put up somewhere until the property becomes available,” says chief executive David Cox. “Consequently, these costs need to be covered by the existing tenants and these two costs are legitimate deposit deductions.“This is why we’re calling on government to ensure urgent action is taken to support those who have been financially burdened by the impact of coronavirus.”However, Samantha Jenkins, a solicitor with DAS Law, takes the opposite view, pointing out that tenants are required to leave a property in the same condition as they found it. “Assuming the property was handed back to the landlord in a clean condition, a landlord is not able to hold the tenant liable for the cost of professional cleaning, nor of rehoming a new tenant,” she says.“There are currently no regulations which would suggest that the legal position differs simply because a tenant has any of the symptoms connected with the coronavirus.”The trouble is, if you refuse to pay, the landlord could withhold the deposit, in which case you’d have to raise a dispute with the Deposit Protection Service. If they find in your landlord’s favour, the small claims court would be a last resort.In January I booked five nights at a hotel in Spain from 29 March using Booking. Since then, the Spanish government has banned travel to Spain, but the hotel is insisting that my booking is still valid and that I will lose the entire cost if I cancel or amend it. Why should customers be expected to pay for services that they are prevented from collecting?ME, Milton KeynesThe hotel will have to change its stance after 24 March when all Spanish holiday accommodation providers are required to close because of the outbreak, although even then it may not be able or willing to refund you. Its response is in breach of Booking’s new emergency policy, which has declared the pandemic a “force majeure” and requires its member companies to cancel and refund bookings, and waive cancellation charges, if guests are prevented from travelling. The web giant will waive its commission charges in such cases.Booking did not respond as to what action it will take against uncooperative providers. You could try a claim against your credit card issuer under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act but banks are not legally obliged to refund transactions made by a third-party agent.My granddaughter attends a Bright Horizons nursery which has closed due to the outbreak. The contract states that the full fees will continue to be payable during the closure, but there is no statement of commitment to pay the salaries of staff. The management has refused to take calls after this was questioned. It would be good to know that the fees are going to the staff and not to increase profits during a crisis.SK, LondonBright Horizons did respond to my questioning and says it will now not be charging parents fees for April. “We continue to pay colleagues and are very mindful of their financial wellbeing and our responsibilities,” it says.You are one of several readers to have contacted me about Opodo’s guarantee. Despite the reassuring name of the policy, two words in the small print could cost you your honeymoon. “Force majeure” events are exempted from full refunds in the terms and conditions and customers can only reclaim the cost of the guarantee and any taxes refunded by the airline, unless the airline cancels the flight, in which case a fare refund is due.“In the current situation, the policy is unfortunately not valid for travel to countries that are heavily affected,” Opodo says, although it has since offered you the option to rebook for no extra charge within the next 12 months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0f039a1aa8ab7a8befd0b4b9bb65cf7579a99cf/0_60_4564_2739/master/4564.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ce1f5bebffb66d7a2297bf5bff48044","title":"how coronavirus infected the global economy podcast","story":"’s economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the global economy was already in poor shape when the coronavirus crisis struck.

Nor will they visit his office at Star City, which preserves everything as it was on the day the first man in space died in a 1968 training flight crash.The customary visits were never crowded events, but in keeping with the lockdowns and social-distancing measures brought in around the world, space agencies and their staff are not taking any chances.“All the traditions are scrapped,” said Frank de Winne, the head of the European Space Agency’s astronaut corps, who received his test pilot degree from the Empire Test Pilots’ school in Boscombe Down, Wiltshire. “The crew is locked up and cannot see anybody except those who are screened.”Before the virus arrived, space station crews spent two weeks in full quarantine at the Baikonur launch site in southern Kazakhstan, but were free to attend ceremonies and farewell meals in Moscow before flying out to the cosmodrome. The tougher measures mean that crews, including the Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoli Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, who are due to launch on 9 April, must now be quarantined for two weeks before they even reach Baikonur.“The quarantine is much more strict now. As few people as possible will have access to the crew, which means that scientists who need to get baseline data from them have to go into quarantine as well before they can access the crew and do their final checks. It has a big impact on the operations,” said De Winne.Esa has sent staff home from its sites across the continent and all training has been put on hold at its European Astronaut Centre in Cologne. Astronauts who were already at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in Houston will stay on for more training and fly back to Cologne when it is considered safe to do so. “We are basically reshuffling the entire training plan of the astronauts,” De Winne said.Nasa faces its own problems with the spread of the virus. The US space agency’s chief administrator, Jim Bridenstine, told staff on Thursday that work was being paused on Orion, a new rocket and crew capsule that was hoped would return astronauts to the moon in 2024.It is not just crewed missions that have been disrupted. Scientific missions scattered across the solar system and scheduled for launch this year are also a concern. Esa’s director general, Jan Wörner, said that if the situation continues for months, delays are to be expected. “It’s not only the launches. Scientific missions take years of preparation and if you interrupt the preparations sometimes it’s not possible to get it back on track. That for sure is an impact,” he said.For now, Esa teams can still take data from their spacecraft, but that is not guaranteed if the crisis worsens. Staff are monitoring for collisions from home – on average, each spacecraft has to dodge a satellite or a chunk of space debris twice a year – and are on standby to come in if needed. But Wörner says that he cannot pare the workforce down further. “We cannot close more than we have. We are at level zero,” he said. “I’m really nervous. The problem is you don’t know how to handle it. I have a crisis meeting over Skype every day.”De Winne said that despite the disruption,Esa was in an extremely privileged position, unlike many businesses that faced real hardship in the months ahead. He urged people to wash their hands and stay at home to help slow the spread of the virus. “All our astronauts are staying home. On the International Space Station we have no place to go for six months, so I think everybody can stay home for a couple of months,” he said. “It’s not too bad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75663ad2687911fcdcc02df1f5958fc48c03519d/0_215_2584_1550/master/2584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcfc8c3c738cd65e216c913ad8e27a5b","title":"ukad rebukes uk athletics over withheld report into salazar and farah","story":"The UK Anti-Doping Agency has delivered an extraordinary rebuke to UK Athletics for its repeated refusal to hand over a 2015 internal report into Alberto Salazar’s relationship with Mo Farah, which is said to contain sensitive medical data.Ukad is understood to be angry and disappointed to have received only an edited PowerPoint summary of the report by UKA’s performance oversight committee (, which was led by three former athletes and concluded there were “no concerns” about Farah continuing with Salazar.In a highly unusual and pointed statement, Ukad’s chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, said: “We remind UKA that they are bound by the National Anti-Doping Policy. We call again on UKA to hand over this review in full, including the associated supporting reports and documents.She added: “We have repeatedly requested that UK Athletics share this POC review with us in its entirety as there could be information included that is of interest to us.”However, UK Athletics says the delay has been caused by the need to get consent from certain parties before handing over the report - and Ukad only began asking for it last month. “Any implication by anyone that UKA is being obstructive in this matter or in any way failing in its duties, is wholly wrong and inaccurate,” a spokesperson said.UK Athletics also insisted that its lawyers had received correspondence on Friday afternoon from Ukad’s in-house legal team “setting out a framework and reassurances of confidentiality to enable UKA to share documents containing sensitive information within the 2015 POC review, which UKA have been advised needs specific consents. This was in response to a letter dated 3 March 2020 from UKA lawyers to Ukad. UKA and Ukad have been addressing this cooperatively, to enable access to relevant documents in compliance with legal duties.”On Friday a separate independent report into UK Athletics’ relationship with Salazar between 2011 and 2017 by the sports lawyer John Mehrzad revealed that UK Athletics had not kept minutes of vital meetings in which Farah and Salazar’s relationship was discussed, and also expressed unease that UK Athletics’ 2015 review was in-house and may have been seen to lack independence. But he found it had come to a reasonable conclusion.Surprisingly, Mehrzad does not appear to have consulted Ukad before publishing his findings. The Observer has also discovered that redacted sections of Mehrzad’s report can be accessed by copying and pasting them into a Microsoft Word document.In October Salazar, who guided Farah to four Olympic and five world titles between 2011 and 2017, was banned for four years for doping. Salazar has said he will appeal against the ban. Farah has maintained his innocence and no Salazar athlete has tested positive.Meanwhile, a growing number of sporting bodies, including USA Swimming and USA Track and Field, are now calling for the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed. The Brazilian, Norwegian and Slovenian Olympic Committees have also called for the Games to be pushed back in the last 24 hours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18e00ba0be3ec46c78df1ec8402c89b936f57b2a/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c012c3621518ab9674da84ee89d04ec0","title":"tokyo olympics organisers considering options to delay reports","story":"As thousands flock to the Olympic flame in Japan, the organising committee is reportedly drafting plans to postpone the GamesAs huge crowds defied coronavirus fears to queue for hours to see the Olympic flame in northern Japan, a report emerged that organisers of Tokyo 2020 have begun drafting alternatives to holding the Games this summer.In contrast to the official line from the Japanese government and the IOC, two sources familiar with the talks have told news agency Reuters that options for postponing the Games are now being drawn up.While the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted sports events around the world, Japan has been steadfast in saying that the Games will go on. The top government spokesman on Wednesday said Tokyo wasn’t preparing for postponement.The flame arrived in Japan to a scaled-down welcoming ceremony on Friday, but on Saturday more than 50,000 people queued to watch it being displayed at Sendai station in Miyagi. Some had to stay in a 500-metre queue for several hours, local media said.Shinzo Abe has staked his legacy as Japan’s longest-serving prime minister on the Games and is hoping for a boom in tourism and consumer spending. At risk is more than $3bn in domestic sponsorship, an Olympic record, and some $12bn spent on preparations.“Finally, we have been asked to make a simulation in case of a postponement,” said one of the sources, an official close to the organising committee who is involved in drafting the scenarios. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.“We are making alternative plans – plan B, C, D – looking at different postponement timeframes,” said the official, adding the scenarios included cost estimates for different delays.Neither Tokyo 2020 organisers nor the International Olympic Committee (IOC) immediately responded to a request for comment. The government of Japan could not be reached for comment.The options, which include scaling back the Games or holding them without spectators, would be debated by the organising committee at the end of March, the official said.The second source, who is also close to the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, confirmed that postponement was being discussed, including delays of one or two years.Some organising staff were holding out hope for a delay of a month or 45 days, said the official involved in drafting the scenarios. A final decision on postponement will have to come from the IOC but Japan’s stance also matters. The IOC and its powerful chief, Thomas Bach, say the Games will go ahead as planned, drawing fire from athletes who say that could be a health risk.Two other insiders, both senior members of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, echoed those concerns. One of them, a board member of the organising committee, said the decision to postpone should be made quickly.“The more they push the decision away ... more and more preparations have to be made – this will cause cancellation fees to go through the roof,” the board member said.Bach recently appeared to shift his tone, saying the IOC was “considering different scenarios”.The official involved in drafting scenarios said a long delay could spark complaints from older athletes and require keeping sponsors on board for longer. Another headache is the Olympic village, due to be converted to flats after the Games. The summer 2021 sporting calendar is already crowded while 2022 will see the soccer World Cup and the Beijing Winter Olympics.Japanese sponsors are nervous, company representatives have said privately. Major sponsors include Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e33044ab9b431f127257bd580d320579797bdd/20_0_5158_3095/master/5158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d03faa2c22f2c0f21d37f16fab0497","title":"readers tips visit wildlife nature reserve uk sawdays stay","story":"Whether it’s a wetlands, mountainside, coastal fringe, forest or heath … share details of your favourite UK nature reserveAs with all attractions, some wildlife reserves may be closed during the coronavirus outbreak.

In the 3 March primaries the former New York city mayor won only one US territory.Bloomberg’s contribution amounts to more than the national party’s typical cash balance. The transfer will help the DNC make up some of the steep fundraising shortfall it has compared with its Republican counterpart, which routinely has raised tens of millions more in election cycles.Bloomberg, one of the world’s wealthiest men with a net worth estimated to exceed $60bn, promised throughout his campaign that he would help Democrats try to defeat Donald Trump regardless of how his own White House bid fared.The Bloomberg campaign, which hired a staff of 2,400 people across 43 states, will also transfer its offices in six pivotal states to the Democratic parties in those states, to help accelerate their hiring and organising. Those states are Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Former Bloomberg campaign staffers in those offices will continue to be paid by his campaign through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April. After that, they could in theory offer the state parties a trained and ready pool of potential hires to build out their operations heading into the November general election.Bloomberg had promised staffers when they were hired that they would be paid until November, but earlier this month most of his campaign team was told they had been let go and would be paid until the end of March.DNC officials said Bloomberg’s money and real-estate transfers would be used to expand the party’s 12-state battleground program, with a focus on hiring additional staffers to work in organising and data operations. Bloomberg’s former campaign employees will not have any advantage in the hiring process, officials said.Bloomberg and his team were making good on their commitment to stay engaged through to November, said Tom Perez, the DNC’s chairman. He said the support would help Democrats win up and down the ballot and help make sure Donald Trump was a one-term president.Bloomberg dropped out of the race on 4 March, the day after his Super Tuesday disappointment. Since then he has given tens of millions of his own money to various Democratic groups and causes.In a memo to Perez announcing the transfer, the Bloomberg campaign said that while Trump’s mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis should cost him, “we should also not assume that Trump’s incompetence will be enough to make him a one-term president”.“Trump’s ability to lie and propagate misinformation, particularly using digital tools and other means with swing voters in battleground states, will continue to ensure a close race in November. Every decision we make as Democrats must account for this,” the campaign wrote.Since exiting the race, Bloomberg has contributed $500,000 to Voto Latino to help register Latino voters, $2m to the group Collective Future to help register African American voters, and $2m to Swing Left, a group focused on electing Democrats in swing districts.The DNCs battleground effort targets Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. It’s a mix of states that have flipped back-and-forth between the two parties in recent presidential cycles and a few that have leaned Republican but are expected to be competitive in November.Though the DNC will never match its GOP counterpart in financial muscle, Perez and party leaders have placed a premium on coordination across the Democratic spectrum this presidential cycle after watching Republicans quietly upstage them on data operations and voter outreach in 2016.Bloomberg’s direct aid to the national party is possible only because he was a presidential candidate. Federal campaign finance laws place caps on how much an inidual can give a political party committee. But iniduals can loan or contribute as much of their personal money to their campaigns as they want. In turn, presidential campaigns can transfer unlimited sums to official party committees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110065117a9cf3f154b0dd976cd75aefbb779767/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44eaa9b2fc8f25348865dbee9401c30f","title":"anywhere but westminster we need your help covering the coronavirus","story":"Become part of our new video project documenting the impact of the outbreak across the UKFor 10 years, the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series has been about getting out into communities, giving voice to ordinary people, and trying to find a new way of covering politics and current affairs.

After a phone consultation with her GP she was diagnosed with a chest infection and prescribed antibiotics.She began self-isolation last Monday in Manchester, where she lives, but moved to her cottage in Wales on Sunday. “I’m one of the fortunate ones,” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation for elderly people. The majority of us live productive lives and hope that society will take care of us when we are older, but we appear to have been abandoned by the health service and the government.“I’ve finished the course of antibiotics and now I just hope it goes. I’ve been putting Vicks on my chest and taking menthols. I’m quite determined.”O’Neill has been trying to support the people she works with from home. “We offer a lot of activities like horse riding, crafts, etc. Some of those won’t be possible now but we are trying to find ways to deliver other services using video.“I’ve been reading a lot and am nearly caught up with the programmes I’ve missed. At the moment I’m watching Hidden. I have three children and eight grandchildren and I’m actually trying to stop the social contact. When they all try and call it’s the end of the day before I know it.”John, who works as a bicycle courier in Manchester, decided to self-isolate on Saturday after waking up with a cough, fever and shortness of breath. “I wanted to be cautious as my job involves visiting people who might be vulnerable to coronavirus.“I messaged the supply company and they disabled my account for seven days, so I’m unable to work,” said the 24-year-old. “This wouldn’t normally be a problem but they have funds available for people who have coronavirus, but they’re not available unless you get medically tested.”As people were not getting tested for the virus unless they had been admitted to hospital John feared some people in the gig economy may not have access to the funds they need. “It makes sense as it prevents fraud but it’s a very difficult time,” he said.John said he reduces social isolation by talking to people all day on platforms such as Discord, where gaming communities can chat and share their screens while playing. “Not talking to real people can be difficult because you struggle to validate whether your thoughts are valid,” he said. “Hearing people’s voices makes you feel human and it’s a good way of trying to maintain social connections without social contact.“I live alone and one problem is that I don’t tend to remember what day it is. We’re so used to doing things that define our time off work that being at home means not having that shared experience.“I’m anticipating going back to work soon though, as people need food delivered, and there could be someone who is reliant on me.”Rosie,* who works in an office in London, has been in self-isolation for over a week. “I filled in the 111 questionnaire online and it advised me to call my GP,” she said. “I could only get through to a receptionist who advised me to go to the pharmacy, which I didn’t think was a good idea because I had a sore throat and was coughing.“I’m lucky enough to get two weeks’ sick leave from my workplace and my colleagues are supportive and understanding,” said the 37-year-old who is at home with her husband, who works in finance in IT. “My husband’s employer has been pushing for me to get tested but I can’t.”Rosie has been too unwell to do anything but rest at home. “I don’t need to think about how to pass the time as I’m actually sick. I feel tired and weak so I don’t want to do anything. Passing the time is not a big problem.”Andrew Moscrop, 42, works as a GP in Oxford, and has been in self-isolation since Friday after his temperature rose to 38.6C. “My fever resolved over the weekend,” he said. “Any other time I would go back to work as normal, but I can’t.”Moscrop contacted 111, Public Health England, the local health protection agency and the John Radcliffe hospital in the hope of being tested. “The advice was the same. Stay at home. It’s quite frustrating as at the end of the day you just want to do your job.“We are facing an escalating caseload and the government has talked of drafting in retired clinicians. Surely we should be testing frontline health workers so that, if negative, they can return to work promptly after an illness?”Moscrop’s partner, who also works in the health service, has also had to self-isolate along with their young child. “It’s become a bigger issue than we thought,” he said. “The government’s advice doesn’t seem entirely thought through as there’s nothing to say this won’t happen again later down the line.“We need to remain fairly pragmatic about it. We’re surrounded by fields so I took the little one out for a walk and a breath of fresh air. Soon I’ll have to pop out for food. I won’t wear a mask but I’ll just nip in as quickly as possible and use self-checkouts. My partner looked at getting food delivered but the available dates were quite far into the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f32d8900f9fee142a9b0a05b1fb49735150d9d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236131e96309656f76c20ab7907f7993","title":"coronavirus the guardians promise to our readers","story":"Together we can find a way through this crisis, providing accurate and insightful reporting and listening to you, our readersThank you very much for your commitment to the .

There were 1,237 new infections in the past 24 hours and 149 new deaths. The number of new infections is a record high for a single day, and the number of deaths is the same as the day before.Every layer of Iranian society – from clerical to army, as well as local government – had urged people to stay at home for the new year, a time when Iranians traditionally travel to see friends and family and celebrate the coming of spring.Alireza Raisi, the deputy health minister, said unless Iran got a grip on the crisis in the next two weeks, the country would be struggling with the disease for six months.Iranian ministers appear to be wary of imposing compulsory France-style quarantines, despite the rising death toll, because the government does not have the resources to provide welfare payments to low-income workers. Five former health ministers had written to the health ministry urging them to take more radical steps.The government has closed schools, universities and shrines, banned religious and cultural gatherings, but has not announced a ban on traffic. Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, continued his diplomatic drive to ease US sanctions and spoke to Toshimitsu Motegi, the Japanese foreign minister, after Japan contributed $23m (£19.5m) to help Iran.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director of the World Health Organization, told a Lebanese broadcaster that Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, had agreed to ease some of the US sanctions covering banking to allow more medicines to reach Iran. But Brian Hook, the US special representative for Iranian affairs told reporters this week. “Our policy of maximum pressure on the regime continues,” he told reporters. “US sanctions are not preventing aid from getting to Iran.”Iran claims that American promises that medicines and medical equipment are exempt from sanctions are untrue. International banks, wary of US fines, will not permit the transfer of Iran’s financial resources stored in other countries into a Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement (SHTA), a new humanitarian channel agreed between the Swiss government and the US on 27 February.Despite the tensions between the US and Iran, Michael White, a US citizen jailed by the Iranians three years ago has been released on medical grounds, and is staying at the US embassy in Tehran.

But for the journalists reporting on the outbreak who can’t switch off, the personal toll is becoming apparent.On Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday morning, newsreader Diana Speed was audibly emotional after reporting on an interview with Ken Finlayson, whose wife, Kimberley, 52, contracted coronavirus and died in Bali following surgery.Elsewhere, on the US television network MSNBC, news anchor Rachel Maddow broke down on live television while paying tribute to her colleague Larry Edgeworth, who died of coronavirus.Journalists delivering public service broadcasting have been identified as key workers along with health workers and those providing essential public services, meaning they can still send their children to school whilst they go to work. Many feel under enormous pressure to make sure that the public are getting the right information about the outbreak.For Rob Osborne, the National Correspondent for ITV Wales, looking after his family while continuing to report on the virus is putting him, like many journalists and others in frontline professions, under pressure. He was distracted in an editorial meeting earlier this week because his mother was repeatedly phoning him with questions about coronavirus. His mother has underlying health conditions and cares for his uncle, who has Down syndrome.That was when Rob realised that telling his family’s story was an opportunity to help others across the country struggling to understand the rapidly changing information coming out of government. In the resulting video, which has had more than 135,000 views on Twitter, Rob talks to his mum about the difference between social distancing and self-isolation, and explains why he can’t come near her at the moment.“The fact that the virus is likely to impact the country for weeks or months to come means it is important that journalists do not burn out. This is a marathon. We’re in this for the long haul,” said Osborne.“I’ve always been able to separate the story from my own feelings. I’ve covered some horrific stories. But with this, it’s the personal element. For me yesterday it was that my uncle doesn’t understand why he can’t go out because he has Down syndrome. It’s normally me who takes him out but I can’t do it. That’s when I took a deep breath.“It’s going to be tough. We’re professionals, but this is going to affect us all. And I think the public appreciate that. The human touch is appreciated.”One said: “I am a sport journalist left with no work at all as a result of the near-blanket cancellation of all sport. As a husband and father, I still have considerable monthly outgoings – just limited funds with which to meet my responsibilities.”Another sport journalist who has lost most of his work said: “I have a mortgage and children. My children finish school and nursery on Friday, yet we have been told we will still be charged the monthly fee for the nursery. Thank god my wife is still working, but her own job could be in jeopardy despite her boss reassuring her she is OK for now.”Hannah Storm, director of the Ethical Journalism Network, who has been working for the past decade in journalism safety, wrote: “News organisations have had to reinvent decades of working practices in days. Large numbers of journalists are self-isolating or quarantined, travel has been reduced between countries and within countries. As Covid-19 spreads, so do the levels of anxiety around what we know and don’t know, who and what to trust, and how to stay safe – physically and mentally – as journalists working in uncertain times.”The BBC told the : “Covid-19 is a harrowing story for everyone, including our staff. The BBC takes seriously its responsibility to support employees during this time and there are support structures in place to ensure we do this effectively. We are determined to carry on covering the story for the public and will continue to do so for as long as it takes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/917bb37be929cff46996f147c7114ccb70f3e184/1269_0_3873_2325/master/3873.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee4bec76fe7ec64a9354614fef54eda6","title":"disney streaming service to launch with lower bandwidth","story":"Disney will monitor internet congestion to reduce pressure on broadband infrastructure during coronavirus outbreakDisney’s new streaming service will launch in the UK and Western Europe with hits such as Frozen 2 streamed at slower speeds to reduce congestion on broadband networks as millions are confined to their homes.The French government has gone a step further and asked Disney, which is set to release the hit Star Wars live action spin-off The Mandalorian outside the US, to delay the launch of Disney+.“To our French fans, the Disney+ service is coming, but at the request of the French government, we have agreed to postpone the launch until Tuesday, 7 April 2020,” said Kevin Mayer, Walt Disney Company’s chairman of direct-to-consumer and international.Mayer said: “In line with Disney’s longstanding commitment to act responsibly, we are responding to the request of European commissioner for internal market Thierry Breton to work together to ensure the smooth functioning of the broadband infrastructure.“In the coming days, we will be monitoring internet congestion and working closely with internet service providers to further reduce bitrates as necessary to ensure they are not overwhelmed by consumer demand.

It took him six hours and 48 minutes. He got nauseous and worried the neighbours would complain about the pounding of his footsteps. But he did it.Technically, the French authorities are still allowing people to go outside for exercise such as running, if they fill out and sign a form explaining their reasons for leaving their homes.The number of joggers on French streets has multiplied in recent days, amid exceptionally balmy weather. And that has authorities worried that too many people are still out on the streets, threatening efforts to contain the virus.“If everyone thinks the same way and does the same thing, we will all find ourselves outside and that won’t help anything, and the message that we need to stay confined at home will have had no impact,” said Nochomovitz.He said he had been training for a marathon, adding: ““I needed to assure myself that I could still run 40km.”He lost track of how many laps he did, but his pedometer kept track while his mind wandered. “I thought about many things, what’s going to happen, when I see that the world has stopped, sports, economy, finance,” he said. “We learned in history about wars between nations, men and weapons, but this is something that is beyond us.”He especially thought about medics, which he described as the real everyday heroes”.He had crucial support in his challenge. “I had my girlfriend here who was giving me drinks and M\u0026ampMs.”Outside, some onlookers stared in confusion.

But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Earlier this week, the health select committee chairman, Jeremy Hunt, asked whether the “absolutely heartbreaking” scenes from northern Italy would happen in England and about guidance for medics.In response, the NHS national medical director, Stephen Powis, said the health service and government were doing “everything we possibly can not to get into that circumstance”.Powis said doctors made clinical decisions every day and “what we want to be able to do is to support doctors to make those continued decisions on the basis that they are currently making them”.The new guidelines, which were published on Saturday and are the fastest ever to be produced by Nice, say all patients admitted to hospital should still be assessed as usual for frailty “irrespective of Covid-19 status”.For those who test positive for the virus, decisions about them being admitted to critical care should consider the medical benefit, taking into account the likelihood of the person’s recovery.In its guidance on clinical decision-making, Nice advises medics to “base decisions on admission of inidual adults to critical care on the likelihood of their recovery, taking into account the likelihood that a person will recover from their critical care admission to an outcome that is acceptable to them”.For cancer patients, medics will need to balance the risks of the patient not being treated in the usual way against the risk of them becoming seriously ill through coronavirus due to a weakened immune system, the guidelines state.Workarounds could include treatment being offered at different locations, patients having longer breaks between treatments and delivering treatments in different forms, the document adds.Kidney dialysis patients suspected of having the virus could have their treatment delayed until their test results are known.The guidance also recommends transport services are checked and alternative arrangements made where necessary, if the normal provider refuses to transport patients confirmed to have Covid-19.Further updated guidelines are expected in the coming weeks on symptom management, radiotherapy patients and those with rheumatoid arthritis.Nice said it would make its guidance available online so other countries can see the approach the UK is taking to tackle the virus and care for patients in the NHS.Paul Chrisp, director of the centre for guidelines at Nice, said the three guides had been produced within a week – when usually one set can take up to two years to compile.He said: “We have done these very rapidly so it’s not our usual process, although it’s been as robust as we could in a very short timeframe.Duncan Young, professor of intensive care medicine at the University of Oxford, said it was clear the NHS’s critical care staffing levels and beds would be under serious pressure in the weeks ahead.He said: “This advice is written in part for non-critical care doctors and covers when to seek advice from critical care doctors and what information the critical care team will need.“Implicit in this guidance is that human resources (critical care team members) and physical resources (suitably equipped critical beds) will be extremely stretched in the coming weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fef34efaab0d04fc0e02f472a857d985228812bb/0_47_3664_2199/master/3664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=271f4472c4ba682ff01c99a4fe3ce3ce","title":"pakistan suspends international flights for two weeks to stem covid 19 spread","story":"People told to stay at home for at least another 45 days as south Asian nations ramp up effortsPakistan has suspended all international flights for two weeks to limit the spread of coronavirus, as governments across densely populated south Asian countries ramp up their efforts to contain the virus.Pakistani officials also asked people to self-quarantine for at least another 45 days, as the country reported its third coronavirus death, with confirmed cases rising to 534.Authorities in Bangladesh tightened border controls, while Sri Lankan police arrested more than two dozen people for violating a nationwide curfew.The region, home to 1.9 billion people, appears to be less badly affected than other parts of the world, but the rate of new infections in Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka has accelerated.As a whole, the region has registered 869 coronavirus cases and seven deaths.A senior Indian health ministry official in New Delhi said India had tested some 15,00 people in about 70 state-run labs, one of the lowest testing rates in the world. However, India is bracing for the inevitable and increasing the number of tests being offered.“At this point we really don’t know what is the extent of the spread,” the health ministry official said on condition of anonymity.Officials are concerned that countries in the region will prove particularly susceptible to the virus, given poor health facilities and infrastructure in many areas.Indian Railways, which carries more than 30 million passengers every day, said some people who had tested positive for coronavirus had travelled by train – forcing officials to track down fellow passengers. RD Bajpai, a spokesman for India’s national railway system, urged people not to travel.In the eastern Indian state of West Bengal, inmates at the largest jail launched a violent protest against authorities for banning visitors due to the virus.“An attempt was made by inmates to set fire to the jail after the convicts fought with the staff but the situation is under control,” said an official at the Dum Dum prison, adding that police fired teargas to quell the unrest.In neighbouring Bangladesh, jail authorities limited the number of visitors and banned the arrival of all flights from midnight except from China, Hong Kong and Thailand after 20 people tested positive, a senior civil aviation official said.At Dhaka airport, authorities started marking the hands of passengers who had been instructed to follow home quarantine.In Sri Lanka, which has reported 72 confirmed cases, police arrested 30 people from various parts of the country for violating curfew, a police spokesman said, adding that the curfew has been imposed till Monday morning.Indians in urban centres were scrambling to buy essential commodities, before a self-imposed day-long curfew on Sunday promoted by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to encourage social isolation.India, the world’s second most-populous country, also plans to halt all incoming international flights to help stem the number of cases, which passed 271 on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3d37aef5121fc1a9d488fa0341166229b8c309/0_306_4616_2771/master/4616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbb15b52411b17c416c7f13fd9e54911","title":"animals cities coronavirus lockdowns deer raccoons","story":"Deer, raccoons, turkeys and other creatures have made their way into urban settings they might normally avoidAs cities around the world mandate lockdowns, quarantines and social distancing, social media posts about animals frolicking through deserted cities have enchanted people anxiously seeking silver linings.We must sadly report that many of these optimistic posts have turned out to be fake – there were no dolphins in Venice’s celebrated canals, or drunken elephants ambling through China’s Yunnan province.But as the coronavirus crisis changes the rhythms of urban life, there are some early signs that animals – especially the creatures that lurk in the periphery of big cities and suburbs – are feeling emboldened to explore.In Nara, Japan, sika deer wandered through city streets and subway stations. Raccoons were spotted on the beach in an emptied San Felipe, Panama. And turkeys have made a strong showing in Oakland, California, home of one  editor.“Normally, animals live in the parts of our cities that we don’t use,” said Seth Mangle, who directs the Urban Wildlife Institute at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago. “It makes them an unseen presence, kind of like ghosts.”Gangs of wild turkeys aren’t an uncommon sight in parts of the Bay Area but it seems they’ve got a bit more room to wander through neighborhoods they might not normally visit. Boars have been known to descend upon European cities – but Barcelonans on lockdown have marveled at how the wild animals romp through quiet, deserted streets.In American cities under shelter in place orders, walks and jogs are one of the few excuses for people to go outside. “It’s going to be a really cool time to spot wildlife,” Mangle said.In San Felipe, where restaurants and bars have closed and tourist traffic is almost nonexistent, Matt Larsen has noticed some new visitors on the beach near his home. “There were three raccoons, just frolicking along right at the edge of the surf,” said Larsen, the director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. “I’ve lived here six years, and it was something I had never seen before.”The beach, which is right by the presidential palace, is usually kept clear by security guards, said Larsen, who directs the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. “But normally there are people all around the streets are almost always crowded with foreign visitors and Panamanian tourists,” he said.Larsen, who has been teleworking from home with his wife, was happy to see “nature maintaining itself”, he said. “It was nice to see something a little out of the ordinary.”Quarantines could continue to affect wildlife in unexpected ways, said Paige Warren, an ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I’ll be interested in whether creatures like coyotes and foxes start acting more bold in American cities,” she said. At the same time, fewer people in the streets could drive some species away, she said, especially those who subsist on whatever humans feed them – or leave behind in the trash.That is the case in Nara Park, where the sika deer – which look like Bambi – have grown accustomed to tourists lining up year-round to feed them rice crackers. Now that the park is devoid of human visitors, the deer have begun wandering into the city looking for food. They’ve been spotted crossing city streets and walking through subway stations, snacking on potted plants.In Lopburi, Thailand, the absence of tourists and their tasty snacks left local monkeys brawling over what appeared to be a cup of yogurt.But just as many urban animals have adapted to humans, they’ll find ways to adjust during the quarantine, said Warren.Mangle concurred: “As they said in Jurassic Park, life tends to find a way.” Though his team in Chicago has been working from home and practicing social distancing, Mangle said they were trying to find a way to set up equipment around Chicago for their annual study of urban wildlife and track how the coronavirus crisis may shift animal behavior.The changes will probably be subtle, the researchers said. Urban foxes and coyotes might venture out of their hiding spots a bit more. Birds might roam, graze and hunt new pastures.The narrative that wildlife populations will dramatically rebound and retake cities is fantasy – albeit one that might comfort those looking for meaning amidst the crisis. “If anything, these times may serve as a reminder that animals have always lived in our area,” Mangle said. “We may not think of our cities as a part of nature, but they are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa82f8422db7bfd19d1ab92fbf4ba37ef9ced1f8/56_133_3081_1848/master/3081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66cba6730a1d637c3e78cacd4d53e87a","title":"coronavirus aids epidemic san francisco","story":"HIV and Covid-19 crises have played out in similar ways with inept government responses and stigmatization of certain groupsBecause of the coronavirus, the 7 million people who live in the San Francisco Bay Area have been one step shy of a full lockdown since Tuesday. Amid all the canceled plans, cratering small businesses and disruptions to everyday life, another poignant postponement stands out: The Names Project Aids Memorial Quilt’s return to Golden Gate park has been delayed. A viral pandemic, one whose scale we haven’t fully grasped, has interacted with another.Many Americans have drawn parallels between HIV and Covid-19, noting the inept government response, the stigmatization of certain groups and the heroism of frontline health workers. Like a ghoulish reboot of a television show, some of the same people have returned. Deborah Birx, a longtime HIV doctor in the US military who later became the United States Global Aids coordinator, now serves as the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus task force. Anthony Fauci, an immunologist, has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984.“We had another silent epidemic: HIV,” Birx said at a White House press conference on Monday. “And I just want to recognize the HIV epidemic was solved by the community: the HIV advocates, and activists who stood up when no one was listening and got everyone’s attention.”Her words are unmistakably direct, but for many, the comparison is a cautionary one. HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, roughly 700,000 of the victims were Americans – almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco. The coronavirus has not proven nearly as lethal. Contracting it is certainly not the death sentence that HIV was for so many years, and some advocates are reluctant to push the analogy.“They’re both viruses, obviously, and there are some overlapping parts of this that obviously can be compared,” says John Cunningham, the executive director of the National Aids Memorial in San Francisco, which had been set to debut the quilt in early April, for Golden Gate park’s 150th anniversary. “But in totality, I would never want to draw that direct comparison. That being said, the National Aids Memorial and the Aids Quilt take very seriously our responsibility to share the stories of the epidemic and the stories of a tragic virus that befell a community.”That the Bay Area is a focal point in both epidemics is not lost on longtime Aids activist Cleve Jones. When the city of San Francisco got involved in the fight against HIV, it was spending more than the federal government was, he says.“The most glaringly obvious similarity is that both pandemics began with Republican administrations and a Republican president who did not acknowledge the gravity of the situation,” Jones says. “And the failure of a strong early response led to tragic consequences.”The similarities extend to nomenclature. In the early days, before the term “acquired immunodeficiency disease”, Aids was known as Grid, for “gay-related immune deficiency” – when it wasn’t simply called the “gay cancer” or the “gay plague”, that is. When Donald Trump insists on tweeting about the “Chinese virus”, he claims to be playing tit-for-tat with Communist party propaganda that the virus is of US origin. But it ignores the dangers of scapegoating in a time of panic.Racist tropes, like homophobic stigma 35 years ago, can also inspire false confidence in groups who presume they won’t be affected.“In the early days of the Aids epidemic we were told it only affected gay people,” Jones says, “the result of which was the death of tens of millions of heterosexual men, women and their children”.But before the millions of residents in the six-county Bay Area were told to shelter in place, a meme had spread far and wide among LGBTQ+ Americans. It has two panels, upper and lower. The upper one reads, “Straights: I can’t believe the government would just ignore an epidemic that threatens thousands of lives.” The lower panel reads, “Gays: You don’t say...” superimposed over a picture of the Aids Memorial Quilt spread out over the National Mall in Washington DC.It’s a bit harsh and oversimplified, maybe. But the question it presupposes is a valid one in a region on near-lockdown – because for some people, HIV and coronavirus aren’t separate at all. The fear among long-term survivors of HIVAids is potent, according to Dr Lary Abramson, a retired San Francisco physician who treated patients during that epidemic’s early phases.“I can tell you that the people I know who are currently on meds for HIV, who have survived our plague, are taking extreme precautions,” he says. “They don’t want to get anywhere near this coronavirus and are doing all they can to follow the guidelines the NIH is promulgating.”For younger generations, the instinct is essentially the opposite: to come together in tough times. Even though social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people has arguably never been higher, queer people reflexively seek refuge in queer spaces. Juanita MORE!, a well-known San Francisco drag performer whose parties have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various LGBTQ+ causes, has to balance her advocacy for nightlife against a consistent message of “Stay the fuck home!”“As a mother to so many people in San Francisco, I have noticed that a lot of people are having a hard time – and did all the way up until the quarantine was instated – staying in,” she says. “When we were in that first year of the Aids crisis, that was also hard for a lot of people, and the reason was that everyone had just come to San Francisco. They had just gotten free and come out, and were told again they couldn’t. Those comparisons, to me, are the same.”As of Thursday, some 70 San Franciscans have tested positive for coronavirus, while approximately 15,000 are living with HIV. For Cunningham of the National Aids Memorial, the trauma lingers.“I lived in the Castro during the darkest days of the epidemic,” Cunningham says, referring to San Francisco’s famous gay neighborhood. “And since Covid-19 came upon the scene, there has been a building wave of emotion inside of me and others. I’ve had many conversations and it’s bringing up a lot of unresolved grief and anger.”But, he says, the noble impulse to help one another – within the strictures of a shelter-in-place order – are a welcome parallel between HIV and the coronavirus.“What gave hope and galvanized iniduals to step forward out of what was a tragedy, with the discrimination and prejudice and the lack of a response from the government, we saw some of the best in humanity. We saw neighbors helping neighbors. … Some of the best examples of what it means to be a community were born there.”If people can’t feed one another, we can always check in with a phone call or by Zoom. Regarding public-health leadership under a conservative Republican presidential administration, Cunningham observes that it’s “ironic that two of our heroes, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, were there in the days of the Aids crisis and are here today”.Jones notes the surreality of their presence as well.“One of the things that almost every longtime survivor I know has commented on is how eerie it is to see them up there smiling and nodding while this fool blathers on,” he says. “One can only imagine what is going on inside their head. I think both of them are, every day, probably laying out the degrees of harm: If they were to overly criticize Trump, they would be fired.”Indeed, Fauci has been conspicuously effusive in his praise for the president. But for nurses at Zuckerberg San Francisco general hospital like Sasha Cuttler, the reassuring presence of capable figures at the top doesn’t necessarily translate into an adequate response on the ground. There, too, a resemblance to the Aids crisis years is unsettling.As it was with Aids patients during the 1980s at the hospital’s experimental and nurse-led Ward 86, the frontline caregivers are “predominantly women and queer people”, Cuttler adds. “And we’re doing it with love and caring, making it clear to the patients that we do this job because it’s our job – and we’re not afraid of them or judging them. Both epidemics are used to blame people for their own illness and doing something bad to spread it.”In the meantime, misinformation has continued unabated, much of it from prominent voices. Displaying considerable ignorance of why residents of the Bay Area were urged to remain at home – and of how contemporary HIV medications work – the conservative commentator Mark Steyn remarked on Rush Limbaugh’s show that “It’s a big gay town, San Francisco, and they’re the ones with all the compromised immune systems from all the protease inhibitors and all the other stuff. And they don’t want all the gays dropping dead on the San Francisco mayor’s watch.”Those words could have been uttered on Tuesday, or on any given Tuesday in 1986."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus at a glance 22 march","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Indonesia has confirmed 10 new deaths from Covid-19 and 64 new cases, taking the respective totals to 48 and 514.

Palestinian officials reported the first two cases in the Gaza strip.The UK government has refused to dismiss the idea of an Italian-style lockdown if needed to curb the further spread of the virus, amid reports that many people were out enjoying the weather on Saturday and not practising social distancing. The UK government is to write to 1.5 million people perceived as vulnerable due to underlying health conditions, urging them to stay indoors for 12 weeks.A group of almost 4,000 NHS workers in the UK have pleaded with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to ensure they have adequate protective equipment to deal with the coronavirus crisis. In an open letter to The Sunday Times, the medics have called on Johnson to “protect the lives of the life-savers” and resolve the “unacceptable” shortage of protective equipment.The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced wide ranging restrictions on businesses but has said schools will remain open. Among those affected will be clubs, hotels, pubs, entertainment venues, indoor supporting venues and places of worship. Restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaway only.The Russian military is sending medical help to Italy from today, including mobile disinfection vehicles and medical specialists.Malaysia has sent the army to the streets to enforce restrictions which people appear to be defying.

She has been diagnosed with the virus at Addenbrooke’s hospital, but they haven’t tested her and aren’t planning to. I spend the afternoon calling the Department for Education helpline and my local health protection team to find out if I should close the school. They say carry on as normal, because you haven’t got a confirmed case.I’m sitting there thinking: this is ridiculous. I know I haven’t got a confirmed case, but that’s because they’re not testing. I send out an email to parents explaining the situation.Messages start coming through from other staff saying they’ve got coughs and other signs of coronavirus too – and staff in high-risk groups are isolating. In total, 14 staff are unable to come to work. We try to pull in supply teachers, but it’s hard to find any.I email parents again to say that we’re not sure whether we’re going to be able to open the next day but we are going to do our best.Senior leaders work until 11pm, putting together a plan of how we can keep the school open. Each time we think we have one, another staff member calls in sick.I wake up wondering how many members of staff I will lose that day. But the staff response is amazing. Part-time staff, who weren’t due to come in, offer to work. Parent volunteers and parents who are part-time teachers at other schools say they will help too. It is moving to receive so much support. But by the end of the day, we are 23 staff members down, including some of the key staff who were organising how we would stay open. I work until midnight. I am in practical mode, but I feel worried. How many days are we going to be able to keep going like this? The situation is untenable.In case the school needs to close, we decide to roll out a new online learning platform so teachers can set activities for pupils at home. We have a staff meeting, and deliver five days’ worth of training in about 40 minutes. But lots of children are not in school, so we cannot give them their log-ins.We send out another message to parents and carers warning them to start planning emergency childcare arrangements.Since the government is still saying schools will not close, we spend hours coming up with a plan of how we can stay open, with staff numbers dropping each day. In some year groups, only one teacher is left to cover three classes, with supply teachers and high-level teaching assistants trying to help. One teacher who is in that situation is newly qualified and in her first year of teaching. She works her socks off, like everyone else in the school.At 5pm, Boris Johnson announces schools will close on Friday, except for vulnerable children and those whose parents are key workers. I feel relief, but wonder why I, a headteacher, am learning this from a press conference. I think that was extremely disrespectful. Schools should have been informed earlier so we could start working on what to do.We end the day 30 staff members down.The next morning the government still hasn’t told us what the definition of a key worker is. So we are left with two days to try to put some childcare provision together for Monday, and we have no idea how many children are going to be in school and who will be eligible. This is terrible for us, and terrible for the parents who are key workers. They are all asking me: am I meant to be making arrangements or not? The uncertainty is awful.At lunchtime, we come down to the staffroom and find that our PTA has put on the table this lovely selection of food, bottles of wine and even emergency toilet rolls that staff could just help themselves to. It is a beautiful moment. Staff start crying. We are aware that it may be the last day at our school for all the children in year 6. That hits us hard. All the lovely things we normally do for the children leaving – the end-of-year play, the leavers’ assembly, the residential trip. We can’t see any of them happening now.So we give the kids elbow bumps in the playground at the end of the day and say goodbye. It is really emotional. Teachers form a real bond with the children in their class, and vice versa. To have that snipped off in such a brutal fashion is tough. We have a staff meeting to talk everything through at the end of the day, and teachers break down in tears.We decide we will provide as much outdoor learning as we can next week, and disperse the children who do come in throughout the school. I am conscious that key workers in the NHS are the people most likely to be coming into contact with coronavirus cases, and that their children are probably most likely to get infected as a result. At school, these children will all come together, and potentially infect other kids who will return home to the families of the other workers we are most dependent on.Given the way the government has been behind the curve, very reactive and flip-flopping, I haven’t got a huge amount of faith this has been well thought through. But all schools can do is make sure the children aren’t crammed up against each other where possible.When I reflect on the last week, what gives me hope is how often I’ve seen people being supportive, kind and understanding. We’re in uncharted waters but I know I’ve got the most amazing team of people around me – everyone from our office staff, teaching assistants and teachers to our parents and kids. The strength of our community has been really uplifting and heartwarming. We were already a really close knit community school, but this has brought us that much closer together.When we get our school back, when we get our lives back, we will know what’s most important to us, and I hope we will treasure and value it. Because that will be an amazing foundation for the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48474b0dd292449be1ab1aa9c86d33c8fd829f7/0_164_3494_2097/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7542d09677912030d129efe6197e377c","title":"coronavirus symptoms what should i see a doctor","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 22 March, more than 300,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 13,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 4,800 fatalities. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 92,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19.Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms.So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician.He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories.The least serious are those people who are “sub-clinical” and who have the virus but have no symptoms.Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, “means a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis”.He says: “Those people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.”The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work.A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia.The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree – the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside.He says: “The lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.“But if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.“If they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs that are at the bottom of our lungs.”He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body’s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.“That’s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,” he says.Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told  Australia: “Unfortunately, so far we don’t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.“People are already trialling all sorts of medications and we’re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn’t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.“We ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.”Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.“In some situations that isn’t enough,” he says of the current outbreak. “The pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.”Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.“Most types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic.Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.But Wilson says this “first responder mechanism” can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.“Age is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.“It’s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32689eb16ff342a8e765810e47a0c0f8b0140491/0_254_5674_3405/master/5674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bffc721d52d6101a6171e05462ff440","title":"germany low coronavirus mortality rate puzzles experts","story":"Some query data methodology while others say it gives more accurate picture of threatGermany’s relatively low mortality rate continues to puzzle experts as Covid-19 spreads across Europe, with some arguing the country’s figures give a more accurate approximation of the threat posed by the novel coronavirus, while others question the methodology behind its data gathering.While the epidemic has hit Germany with full force, with Johns Hopkins University noting 22,364 confirmed infections by Sunday morning, only 84 people are so far reported to have died.The contrast with Italy is especially surprising because the two countries have the highest percentage of citizens aged 65 or over in Europe. If anything, the Bloomberg Global Health Index would suggest Italians live a more healthy lifestyle than Germans.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.German politicians and senior health officials have been reluctant to comment on the low mortality rate while the situation is developing so rapidly. Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the government’s central public health body, has said he does not expect there to be a significant difference in mortality rates between Italy and Germany in the long run.“It’s too early to say whether Germany is better medically prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic than other countries,” said Marylyn Addo, who heads the infectiology department at Hamburg’s University Medical Centre.One likely explanation for the discrepancy in figures, Addo suggested, was that while northern Italy’s hospitals are being overrun with new patients, Germany’s are not yet at full capacity and have had more time to clear beds, stock up on equipment and redistribute personnel.“One advantage Germany has is that we started doing professional contact tracing when the first cases were reported,” Addo said. “It bought us some time to prepare our clinics for the coming storm”.Crucially, Germany started testing people even with milder symptoms relatively early on, meaning the total number of confirmed cases may give a more accurate picture of the virus’s spread than in other states.According to Germany’s National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, the country has capacity for about 12,000 Covid-19 tests per day, while Wieler has claimed it has capacity for 160,000 tests per week.While Germany has not tested its citizens at the same high rate practised in South Korea, guidelines have been in place for over a month for people to be tested even if they have early stage symptoms but have either had contact with an infected person or recently visited a “high-risk area” such as Lombardy in Italy or Wuhan in China. The age profile of those affected in the first few weeks has also been younger than in other countries, many of them fit and healthy people returning from skiing resorts in Austria or Italy, which would also help explain the low mortality rate.“I assume that many young Italians are or were infected without ever being detected,” Christian Drosten, a virologist at Berlin’s Charité hospital, told the newspaper Die Zeit. “This also explains the virus’s supposedly higher mortality rate there.”Drosten, who has been advising the German health ministry, has also warned that Germany’s mortality rate is likely to rise in the coming weeks as high-risk areas become harder to identify and testing capacity becomes stretched.“It will appear that the virus has become more dangerous, but this will be a statistical artefact, a distortion. It will simply reflect what’s already starting to happen: we’re missing more and more infections.”The methodology behind Germany’s data gathering could also play into the discrepancy between Italian and German figures. The RKI’s official mortality figures include both people who have died of the virus as well as those with underlying health problems where the precise cause of death could not be determined.If a patient is tested positive for Covid-19 in Germany, the doctor will notify the local health authority, which will then digitally transfer the data to the Robert Koch Institute. The lag in this process explains why the RKI’s daily figures have been consistently lower than those from Johns Hopkins University, which updates its data tables more frequently. By 10am on Sunday morning, for example, the RKI only notes 55 fatalities in Germany.Unlike in Italy, there is currently no widespread postmortem testing for the novel coronavirus in Germany. The RKI says those who were not tested for Covid-19 in their lifetime but are suspected to have been infected with the virus “can” be tested after death, but in Germany’s decentralised health system this is not yet a routine practice.As a result, it is theoretically possible that there could be people who may have died in their homes before being tested and who do not show up in the statistics.Practising medical specialists such as Addo do not believe this number of unreported cases to be statistically significant. “I have yet to see any data that would suggest a large number of untested corona-related deaths that don’t show up in the statistics,” she said.“Clinics dealing with respiratory illnesses have been on high alert about the virus for weeks, so I would be very surprised if there was a significant figure of uncharted deaths.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05cb98a6f34e28503fd51083ed575f15843dd1be/0_147_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26fee7fde8b6a2d1849ecf38de292cc0","title":"london life lockdown coronavirus social distancing","story":"The strangest of weeks in the capital has left residents reeling as the unthinkable rapidly becomes the new normalI spent the first half-hour of Friday morning looking up competing dictionary definitions of the word “persistent”. My wife had woken up coughing and we were wondering whether this was the start of it – seven days of hopefully mild fever and quarantine for her, and 14 days inside for me and my daughter. While I was Googling those semantics, though, and adjusting to the realities they did or did not imply, the coughing stopped, and we all hung, waiting to hear what would come next.This strangest of weeks in the capital, in the country, in the world, has cast us all in that role, every hour.Social media memes from Spanish balconies the rolling TV news with its ever-present know-your-enemy virus graphic texts from friends in various shades of banter or distress Steve from the Wirral on a radio phone-in briefings from government ministers and scientists – all offer the newly housebound competing fragments to piece together as we try to understand what life looks like on the outside.That stay-at-home army has watched the terrifying pictures from Italy on a loop and tried to make sense of the numbers – that morbid Eurovision table of infections and deaths. Then, minute by minute, we have each hazarded a range of appropriate ways to respond: trying to move around cities without touching handrails, occupying imaginary two-metre bubbles in the park, coveting bottles of hand sanitiser, leafleting vulnerable neighbours for shopping orders, lying awake worrying about the rent or mortgage, planning garden projects, sharing lectures in epidemiology and crying over cancelled exams. We spend anxious time telling ourselves health is all that matters, fearing for jobs, setting up Skype accounts, cajoling parents and grandparents to stay indoors, keeping hands away from faces, going through stockpiled food too quickly, scrapping over loo roll, taking our temperatures, trusting official advice and not trusting official advice.One of the most remarkable lessons of the past seven days is just how quickly the mind can make the unthinkable thinkable. A week ago last Friday, Premier League fixtures and the Six Nations rugby were cancelled and there were still plenty of voices arguing overreaction sympathies were being extended to Liverpool fans. Since then we have not only quietly accommodated the closure of our schools and universities and offices, our theatres and cinemas and museums and places of worship – but demanded much more closure, much faster.If marching had been advisable the banners would have read: “Shut everything down now!” Can liberal voices ever have been more vehemently in favour of the imposition of martial law and the end of free assembly as they have been this week?Last Thursday evening, my Twitter feed had been so full of outrage about people “carrying on as normal”, drinking in pubs, going to shops, that I was moved to drive around the streets near where I live in London – through Camden and Islington and Holloway – to witness this “new Luftwaffe” for myself. At 9.30pm there was hardly a car on the streets, and those that were drove very slowly, as if not to disturb the unfathomable quiet. The pubs and restaurants were just about uniformly empty, lit up like a gallery of Edward Hopper paintings.Contrarily, then, the next afternoon, shops in my local high street were crowded, with people coughing nervously into their elbows, presumably convincing themselves, like me, that just going up the road for a loaf of bread or to pick up a prescription was obviously fine. We caught each others’ eyes at a safe-ish distance and smiled and shrugged. Normally you feel ashamed to be obsessing about trivial choices, but trivial choices now feel suddenly like the big questions. We have come to the end of the first urgent week of, “What exactly should we be doing?” and there are many more to come.In this new reality, everything can seem like a portent. We seize on pictures of full trains and we seize on pictures of empty trains. Walking home from the high street with my package of asthma inhalers I was thinking I didn’t yet know anyone directly who had the virus – and then that maybe I knew hundreds, untested.It was the first day of spring blossom two ambulances passed me on their way down the hill. At home, I opened emails from friends much, much closer to the advancing front line: one in Spain who is in the middle of cancer treatment, self-isolated in a bedroom at home and cheerfully determined to get through Ulysses, cursing the prospect of a €100 fine for stepping out into the sunshine the other a clinical director of a London hospital who says: “We created an initial isolation ward, which is now full, and just finished another ward today, which will likely be full by the weekend.”Tone becomes an issue. How do you check in with a friend who may or may not have lost their livelihood overnight? Too much gravity and you sound like a horseman of the apocalypse, but matey ironies have begun to sound hollow. I scroll through tweets at random a stranger writes, “My whole scale of preparedness is off. I’m a catastrophiser anyway, but I can’t gauge where catastrophe is at the moment. Am I being too paranoid? Not paranoid enough? Anxiety is mad at the best of times but now it’s got layers of mad.” I add to the hearts of agreement, and then, next one down, do my bit by offering advice to new-generation workers-at-home.Having mostly been in that particular self-isolation for 20 years now, I’ve narrowed the rules down to two: spend at least as much time in the day walking and talking as you do looking at a screen, and never work lying down. But of course, as I am writing that, I am realising that the new home-working is not the same as the old. It only really makes sense when you are alone. I was struggling to hit a deadline yesterday while my wife was on another Covid-19-crisis conference call with her office from the sofa and my daughter was playing the piano in the hall. In the absence of cafes, I have been checking out park benches with wifi signals. I am writing this at 5am. Unforeseen consequences are our only growth industry.In our semi-isolation, between calls in the living room, we occasionally look up from screens to confirm, “It’s so bloody weirdterrifying” or to ask, “What’s going to happen?” or to agree, “We’re the lucky ones with jobs.” We are already in the habit of convening at 5pm to watch the latest prime ministerial update. I have veered between thinking that the pacing of announcements has been well-judged in getting the whole population fully onboard, to terror at the gaps in provision.After Rishi Sunak’s extraordinary pledges to save the economy on Friday, I called my friend Tony, who owns a pub just off the Strand in London, the Devereux, which has been there since 1677, 12 years after the plague. He had watched the news with his last couple of regulars and confirmed that it all added up. “I’d already agreed to pay my staff for the duration,” he said, “though my accountant said I was mad. But this makes it possible. It’s sad to close of course, but I can see a way beyond it now. We’ll be fine.”Hearing he was about to close his doors for the summer, I got one of those quick, alarming flashes of what it all might possibly look like in a month or six. How much of the fabric of life can you take away before things start to fall apart?In the once-upon-a-time of last weekend, we’d gone out for breakfast to the local cafe, opening doors with our elbows, looking for an isolated corner table, half-joking that this might be the last meal out of the year. The Portuguese waitress, chatting about what it all might mean, and still hopeful that they could get through, had recommended I read José Saramago’s fable Blindness, in which a whole community is rendered sightless by a plague, apart from one woman, a doctor’s wife, who watches the world go mad around her.I Kindled it up last night and, as it unfolded in long spooling paragraphs, imagined myself in the role of the woman, and then of the population, before deciding that I’d best leave it for a month or six to find out how it all ended. Instead, I got involved in a Twitter conversation about which pub I’d go to first when the ban was over I thought about it long and hard. For me, I had to say, the Prince of Wales or the Eagle. It was much too close to call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6802f0914091c260599a5caa20037af82db738c0/311_117_3406_2043/master/3406.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78ecd35bee145df08501396577d7f1ed","title":"quiet with some defiance as bondi beach succumbs to coronavirus closure","story":"The Sydney beach that is a pictorial shorthand for Australia has become emblematic of the nation’s struggle to respond properly to the outbreak • Follow our Australia coronavirus live blog• Follow our global coronavirus live blog Never have the perennially crowded waters on Bondi Beach looked so inviting.But on a glorious bright March day, a late-season spark of brilliance against the encroaching autumn, the golden sand and blue-green waters were, if not deserted, uncannily quiet.Rangers carrying loud hailers marched up and down the beach in socks and shoes telling people the beach was closed and that swimmers, surfers and sunbakers must leave immediately. Entries to the beach were taped shut with red-and-white tape. Signs insisted “area closed until further notice”.Most people complied. (Despite Australians’ cherished self-image as a band of rugged nonconformists, this is a country that, in fact, embraces obedience.)But there were defiant cases, official entreaties politely ignored. Surfers slipped under barriers or jumped into the water from the rocks at the north or south end of the beach.On the sand,  Australia watched one exchange between a ranger and an elderly woman, who conversed with the official for several minutes before putting on her bathing cap and marching into the water.Lifeguards, apologetic at having to enforce a rule that is hazily understood at best, told people simply that the beach was closed and that they could not surf.Aware that over their shoulders a dozen surfers paddled for the best wave of the set, they warned the police boat would come and start handing out fines to those who refused to leave.There was widespread confusion at the rule and its enforcement. The unanswerable questions came rapidly: “Is it just the beach that’s closed, or the water as well?”“There are not 500 people out there, why can’t I go?”“If someone gets out, can I go in?”But the social distancing the beach closure was designed to enforce has had its intended impact. The numbers on the beach were a tiny fraction of what might be expected on a Sunday like this.Bondi Beach, a pictorial shorthand for Australia, has become emblematic of the nation’s struggle to respond properly to the outbreak. The trajectory of Australia’s coronavirus curve mirrors Italy more than it does Singapore. More than 1,000 cases have been reported, and while the death toll remains low, at seven, there are fears this could escalate if the health system becomes strained.“Social distancing” is a lexical addition to every conversation, but its practice is haphazard. Cafes and restaurants are still full. People still seek out the beach on a sunny day.There is also an abiding resentment at the imposition on civil liberties that social distancing is, when such egregious official mistakes are made.On the same day that Bondi Beach was ordered closed, the same government allowed 2,700 people to walk off a cruise ship in Sydney’s CBD which had reported more than 150 illnesses. At least five people from the Ruby Princess have since tested positive to Covid-19, some of whom boarded domestic flights home.Walking south from Bondi reveals the practical difficulties of enforcing a lockout rule along a rocky, meandering coastline, beyond the philosophical challenge of keeping Australians from the beaches they regard as their inviolable birthright.Immediately south of Bondi, the rocky McKenzies Bay was completely open and unguarded, while at Tamarama, next to that, high-wire fencing had been hurriedly installed warning the beach was off-limits for the foreseeable future.Bronte, the next beach south, was being slowly walled off by the same fences.The numbers were down, social distancing was being enforced, if imperfectly.But people were finding their way past. Those waters never looked so inviting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c64a9a7b68f017a08046898ba72ac528bd5a8663/0_83_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705d1a11a297f3909cc4666da8a67ba2","title":"the beautiful south our wild vulnerable world seen from a greenpeace ship","story":"Michael Segalov finds himself transfixed by Earth’s last great wilderness as he joins a month-long polar expedition to AntarcticaIt’s going to get easier, I think to myself, as I lie in bed in the darkness, one hand gripping tightly the edge of the mattress, the other pressing hard on the spot where my head just thudded loudly, again, into a wall. In the bunk below, my cabinmate Oleg is dozing deeply. I might not be sleeping yet, but I will once I’ve found my sea legs. I’ve come a long way, I try to reassure myself, considering it’s only my fourth night at sea.When I arrived on board my temporary new home, Greenpeace’s MV Esperanza, even successfully navigating my way to the bathroom along the ex-Soviet firefighting ship’s labyrinth of narrow corridors had seemed impossible. The environmental NGO had invited me to join them on a month-long polar expedition departing from Patagonia, the final leg of a year-long project to draw attention to the existential threats facing the world’s oceans. The crew had set off from London, before travelling from pole to pole.Now though, after a series of briefings, tours and tips from seasoned crew members, I know where to do laundry, where to shower, where to muster in case of emergency. I can quickly put on an immersion suit. I understand three different types of alarm. I’ve scoped out the best hiding spots for when I’ll need some privacy: the cubbyhole library two nets on the boat’s stern where you can sit as the vast expanse of ocean stretches out behind you and if all else fails, the floor of the linen closet. I can even use the correct maritime terms to describe the different types of wild, sudden movement the boat is making as we cross the notoriously rough Drake Passage into Antarctic waters: “pitching” up and down, or “rolling” from side to side. Still, there’s little anyone can do to help with the tiredness, nausea and bumping into an endless number of metal things that comes with the all-consuming seasickness that has long settled in.Cruising along the Beagle Channel on our first morning – the calm, breathtaking 240km strait of water we’d sailed through after departing from Ushuaia, on the southern-most tip of Argentina – had lulled me into a false sense of security. “It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the beryl-like blue of these glaciers,” Charles Darwin wrote of the strait, after an expedition here in the 1830s. He was right. Mainland Argentina on one side, Chilean islands on the other, we’d been smoothly delivered from the final frontiers of South America towards Cape Horn and out into open oceans, passing snow-capped mountains and luscious greenery – albatrosses, whales and dolphins escorting us from above and below.I’d taken a single motion-sickness tablet as a precaution, after warnings from people who’d made the journey. Honestly? I didn’t understand the fuss. But it turns out that the Beagle’s waters are somewhat more sheltered than those of the wild and exposed Southern Ocean. Only a few days later I’m counting down the minutes until I can pop the next pill. Wave-hits-boat means head-hits-wall, again. That one was probably pitching, I mutter under my breath.There’s sunlight creeping in through the porthole now. For days, I’ve seen nothing but water. Staring out to the horizon is the only remedy for my unrelenting unease. I clamber quietly down from my bunk and head out for the relief some much-needed fresh air might bring.Stepping out into the crisp morning, though, a surprise is waiting. Three huge, jagged icebergs, somehow both deep blue and ghostly white in the orange light of dawn, jut out from the water right in front me, almost welcoming me into a corner of the world I imagined I’d only ever see on screen. A raft of penguins swims alongside. I’m channelling David Attenborough through my delirium. My stomach stirs with excitement – my first encounter with the Earth’s last great wilderness is all that I’d hoped for.In the distance, the peaks of the remote South Orkney Islands are appearing. I stand transfixed, the butterflies inside growing ever more restless. And then I run to the bathroom. What I thought was awe and wonder in my gut is, in fact, a sign that I’m about to puke.While landscapes come and go, and weather switches from blissful summer sunshine to blizzard and back again with little warning, the routine on board remains reassuringly constant. At 7.30am there’s a wake-up call while a help-yourself-breakfast wraps up in the mess. From 8 to 9am everyone pitches into the cleaning, and then the crew of 30 heads off to work. On the decks below, engineers and fitters keep us moving from the bridge, mates navigate. A team of deckhands dutifully ensures everything is in working order, while chef Willy prepares lunch for midday. A queue forms at his hatch on the dot.Unless you’re on watch duty, clocking off is at 5pm – just in time for an unofficial exercise class in the helicopter hangar or a smoke on the poop deck – before dinner is served up at 6pm. All the while, a small group of investigators, researchers and activists are plotting in a makeshift office. Because while the permanent crew keeps the boat running, it’s these campaigners who truly set its course.Greenpeace employs three ships to further its environmental efforts. Each is represented by a toy boat on a map pinned to a wall, reflecting their current positions. And as each traverses the oceans, an ever-changing team is drafted in from Greenpeace’s international offices to take the helm. From climate change to plastic pollution, deep-sea mining and oil drilling, all manner of issues have been explored on this ambitious voyage. Right now it’s an issue called “transhipping”.After arriving in the Antarctic proper three days earlier, we’ve anchored in a sheltered bay off the South Orkneys. Glaciers lead down to the water, which is peppered with icebergs. On a distant shoreline, a smattering of structures marks the British Antarctic Survey’s Signy Island Base. The waters might have calmed, but on board the atmosphere is anything but tranquil.Surrounded by maps, charts and laptops, Sophie Cooke, the mission’s lead investigator, is in the campaign room holding a briefing on a direct action set to take place the following morning. Transhipping, Cooke explains, is how fishing boats transfer their catch on to cargo vessels while at sea, swapping fish for fuel, workers and supplies. It’s a system that allows fishing operations to maximise profits, simultaneously making it possible to travel into distant waters with almost no need to return to port. Earlier that day, Greenpeace had published a report that was three years in the making it set out the harm transhipping can do, both to the oceans and the fishermen on board.It’s how, Greenpeace argues, illegal and unregulated fish are laundered into the market, which is estimated to be worth between $10bn and $23.5bn annually. (“Dodgy fish” is mixed together in freezers with more sustainable, better regulated catch.) Human rights abuses at sea – including poor working conditions and modern slavery – are well documented, and by transhipping, beyond scrutiny and national jurisdiction, such malpractice is too often out of sight and out of mind. There are three transhipment boats (known as reefers) currently in the South Orkneys, I’m told. Using complex satellite mapping and ship-tracking software, Cooke and her team have identified one of them – a cargo vessel they suspect has dodgy fish on board.They plan to attach a giant rubber fender – emblazoned with the words “Ocean Destroyer” – to the ship in question, and have a group of climbers scale the side using rope ladders, to conduct a vigilante inspection in an attempt to see what’s hiding in the ship’s refrigerated hold.The next morning, from a speedboat, I watch as the team pulls together with military precision. The distinction between crew and campaigner melts away.Everyone on board has a story explaining how they ended up here. It’s not the sort of job you can stumble into. For deckhand Usnea Granger, time spent fighting to save ancient Oregon woodland from deforestation as a teenager inspired her to pursue environmental activism. Chief mate Adrian Arauz describes the fields and rivers of his childhood in rural Panama. “It was instilled in me from an early age that we should take care of our surroundings, because in the end it’s nature that provides.”It was an oil spill off the coast of Galicia in northwestern Spain that first got a young Fernando Romo interested in marine conservation. He recalls with vivid clarity a childhood memory: walking down to the beach in his hometown to be greeted by washed-up dead wildlife, the sand drowning in crude oil. While working on a commercial tanker ship in the 1990s, he and his team were tasked with pumping oil-infused water into the sea. Soon after he became a member of Greenpeace. He was working on their ships by 2008, and promoted to the role of captain in 2017.Compared to my digs, Romo’s cabin is practically palatial. There’s an office with room for a desk and sofa, and penguin postcards pinned to a noticeboard. A thin curtain separates his sleeping quarters from where we’re sitting.“As captain, you’re the representative of a ship’s owner,” the 49-year-old says, “and you’re ultimately responsible for the whole operation of the ship.” In normal circumstances, say, on a cargo boat, that means getting your goods from port to port on time with no glitches. At Greenpeace, things are a little different: “We don’t deliver shipping containers, we win campaigns.”This adds another layer of responsibility and risk to Romo’s workload. He’s not just a sailor, he’s an activist, too. It means breaking laws and putting the boat into situations that most other captains would do everything in their power to avoid.That, Romo says, is how he stays positive. Eco-anxiety and burnout are common among environmental campaigners. I’d have imagined that spending every waking hour fighting for the planet’s future while witnessing firsthand parts of the world most vulnerable to the effects of climate catastrophe might be hard to handle.I don’t know why, but I arrived in the Antarctic expecting to come face to face with our shared, dystopian future. I thought that seals were going to be choking on plastic bags, that chunks of once pristine icebergs were going to be melting into piles of greyish mush. I thought it might trigger alarm bells. Instead, the air is fresher than any I’ve ever breathed, there’s wildlife in abundance, the seawater runs clear.But being here is an eerie reminder that we can’t wait for the consequences of climate change to be visible in places like this – it will be far too late by then. It’s no coincidence, I’m realising, that the only continent with no permanent population and few visitors is also the one in which nature has best survived the most damaging effects of humankind. And far from despairing, I feel myself becoming more determined than ever to help preserve this unsoiled natural world. It’s suddenly real, no longer an idea in the abstract, or a scene on TV. Spending time with people who’ve given their lives to defending it is a stark reminder that most of us can, and must, play a bigger part in its survival, if we’re to turn the tide.“If anything, I think working for Greenpeace has made me more hopeful,” Romo assures me. “You’re doing something positive and proactive, and seeing the results of your effort. Last time we came to Antarctica we were campaigning to make ocean sanctuaries to protect wildlife from overfishing. We didn’t achieve everything, but we forced the boats here into creating buffer zones for penguin feeding grounds, and that’s a win.” Romo isn’t complacent. That’s why they’ve come back again. “The climate emergency is the biggest threat to civilisation as we know it, and that’s a challenge. But if I’m going to be anywhere to fight it, here’s the right place to be.”Two or three weeks in, I’ve lost track of time completely. The team has turned its eye to scientific research. A high-tech underwater robot camera scours the seabed for trash and mysterious species, and we visit the colossal A-68, the largest iceberg to have broken off from the shelf. (It is twice the size of Luxembourg.) Through the mist, it stretches out as far as the eye can see in every direction, a sinister omen of what further global warming might bring.From the South Orkneys we sail closer to the Antarctic Peninsula, a strip of the continent that protrudes northwards into more navigable waters. I become spoilt: a few whales spotted starboard aren’t as close as the last pod with notes on a whiteboard updating me, the idea of having to plan my own day feels like a drag.There’s on-board wifi keeping me connected to civilisation, although how it works remains a mystery. (It involves, I’m told, a complicated satellite system.) Just a few years ago, being at the end of the world meant losing touch completely. If, say, a panic-inducing medical epidemic happened to sweep the world, you wouldn’t hear about it. I’m grateful I can Skype my family, but while being online is convenient, a part of me was hoping for a little more isolation. I wanted to switch off and experience time spent truly off-grid. Instead, I’m scrolling through Instagram, responding to work emails as if I’m sitting at my London desk. But then, one particularly bumpy afternoon, I drop my iPhone when a big wave hits, and the screen smashes to pieces, so I surrender myself completely to my life at sea.One day, a picture-perfect sunset appears over Discovery Bay, on the north side of the South Shetlands. I polish off my final bottle of stowed-away duty-free Malbec. Then Will McCallum, Greenpeace’s head of oceans, appears with the news I’ve been waiting for: my opportunity to set foot on the continent has finally come. “What we have seen sailing from the Arctic to the Antarctic was much more dramatic than we expected,” McCallum explains, “and ocean-going industries are paying scant attention to the need to rein in their worst excesses.” What is at stake, he says, is not only the survival of the creatures that inhabit the waters they’ve visited, but also life on this planet as we know it. The ocean sustains life on Earth by providing us with oxygen nearly half our planet depends on it for food. Here in the Antarctic, climate change means parts of the continent have reached unprecedented temperatures. Without urgent action the consequences of ice melts, and subsequent sea level rises, will be devastating.Conveniently for me, however, Greenpeace doesn’t just want to highlight destruction. With a team of photographers, videographers and social media types they want to document the continent’s beauty – to capture just what is at risk.A short trip in the speedboat and I’m standing alone on a green, mossy carpet atop a hill on Barrientos Island. Thousands of chinstrap and gentoo penguins are standing, swimming and shitting on all sides. In front of me, the infinite, silky ocean. Behind, mountains drenched in sun and thick, white snow. It’s bliss. Too soon, it’s time to head back to the Esperanza. A few days later, we’ll begin our long journey home.The sound of us upping anchor for a final time brings with it a sudden panic. My month at sea has left me institutionalised: once I disembark who’ll cook my lunch, pick the film, tell me when and where to be? Most of all, though, I fear I’ve taken my time soaking up the Antarctic’s splendour for granted. Did I make the most of it? What will I do when I look through a window and all this magnificence just isn’t there? I suppose those last ones are probably questions we all have to grapple with. Unless there’s a radical shift in how we interact with our precious planet, there might well come a day when we look up and it’ll have disappeared for good."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199820.1583937458!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"counting hares under the spotlight","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland had an estimated 223,000 Irish hares in the winter of 201819. Picture: Michael VineyIn an early initiation into sheep-country nightlife, I was awoken on a winter night by a sudden blaze of light beyond the bedroom curtains. Peering out, I found a 4x4 parked opposite our gate and a mounted spotlight probing the rough hillside across the road.The gun patrol didn’t pause long. Failing to raise any foxy form or eye-glint among the rushes, the rifle was lowered and the sheep left to resume their digestive doze in the dark.Not all nocturnal spotlights have been so intently malign quite the contrary. Until recently, they also seemed the best way of counting Irish hares, always a challenging undertaking given the animal’s historical swings in population.Thus, a national survey in 2007 ided the countryside into mapped grid 10km squares and used a powerful spotlight “from point transects located along minor roads”. The hares are most active between dusk and midnight again in the half-light of dawn.The results were worth having but limited in their coverage: would the camera traps of so many TV wildlife films give a more thorough picture? An eight-strong cross-Border team assembled by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) set out to compare the two methods in a new national survey (Irish Wildlife Manual 113 at npws.ie).A pilot survey used a mobile “two million candlelight spot lamp” shone in two-minute bursts from along minor roads. The cameras, fixed at random to cover the same area, were strapped low on trees, bushes and fence posts and triggered by movement to record 15-second videos.After 4.3 survey hours, observers behind the mobile spotlight had recorded 84 inidual animals – hares, fox, badger and rabbits. In contrast over the same areas, 59,000 video hours from 351 cameras recorded 2,604 iniduals of 12 species, including 20 times more Irish hares, lots of farmland birds, and 1,800-odd rabbits (this from inadvertently fixing some cameras next to a warren).Then came the full camera survey, using 596 cameras deployed at random within 44 squares and yielding some 106,000 video hours – the equivalent of about 12 years of continuous observation. It found 253 hares, compared with nine in the spotlight pilot survey.Scaled up by the area of each geographic region, this estimated that the Republic had some 223,000 Irish hares in the winter of 201819. They were more numerous in the north and west but showed the widespread grassland distribution typical of the Irish species. Despite threats from farming, traffic and a new rabbit viral disease, its conservation status is reckoned favourable and stable.Arrays of camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoring, especially to judge the impact of the new haemorrhagic disease. If the camera specified in the team’s report is the American “deer trail” camera I matched online, it retails at $160, complete with a year’s battery.Hi-tech ecology is already at the command of the NPWS in certain of the six-yearly checks on species that satisfy the EU’s long-standing habitats directives. Counting, say, a particular endangered plant on Ireland’s sand dunes still demands a pair of consultant botanists trudging up and down geometrically for hours and days, but a census of seals needs more costly attention.Recently in this column I speculated on the predatory appetite for seal meat of the orcas – killer whales – that we share with Scottish waters. New research from the University of Aberdeen has potentially linked the orcas to a dramatic decline in numbers of Scotland’s harbour seals, with numbers in Orkney and Shetland dropping by 40 per cent in five years.I suggested it might be necessary to check again on the numbers of Ireland’s harbour seals. But this overlooked a recent survey for the NPWS of both grey and harbour seals, using thermal imaging from the air. It was the third such nationwide survey in summer and was carried out by the Sea Mammal Research Unit of the University of St Andrews in 2017 and 2018.Flying in the peak harbour seal moult season in August and early September, the team’s helicopter carried a multi-camera, gyro-stabilised gimbal (you will want to know this) containing a laser range-finder, a colour HD digital video camera, a mid-wavelength thermal imaging video camera and a digital camera with a 300mm telephoto lens!Predictably, most harbour seals were hauled out in sheltered corners of the coast, while most large groups of grey seals kept to more exposed shores, rocky reefs and offshore islands. The harbour seals totalled 4,007 and the greys 3,698, the highest counts for both species in summer. Adjusting for the greys’ different time ashore in summer, they outnumber the harbour seals by two or three times."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209067.1584813109!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why are we having such spectacular sunsets it s all down to the light","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe sun sets over Lowertown, Rahugh in Co Westmeath on Friday evening. Photograph: INPHOJames CrombieDramatic sunsets which have draped vivid warm colours over Irish skies in recent evenings are set to continue, forecasters are predicting.Intense hues of yellow, orange and red have been lighting up dusk around the country, briefly distracting from the dark mood felt by many underneath the skies.So why are the sunsets and sunrises so dramatic at the moment.The country is enjoying a couple of relatively settled days and this dry, calm, still weather “scatters the light” molecules in a different way and also the changing directions of light rays, she said.“Our eyes are sensitive to the wavelengths in that and the different colours associated with different wavelengths, which bend in different directions.”Both at sunrise and sunset, light has to travel a greater distance to reach our eyes, than during the day, when it is more directly overheard.So more of the blue — that we see in a cloudless sky — gets filtered out. This reveals more of the warmer colours of the rainbow that make up light.Because we are coming into the spring equinox, there is also more sunlight and the sun is higher in the sky.“On Friday there were quite spectacular sunrises and and particularly sunsets around the country,” said Ms Ryan.“The east coast probably saw the best sunsets, as there was cloud rolling up from the south of the country.”And, says Ms Ryan, we can expect to see more of the same in the coming days, as an easterly airflow likely keeps the air dry and clear.“Eastern and southern counties and maybe inland could expect some fairly spectacular sunrises and sunsets to come,” she said.“Nice springy weather” is also on the way for most of the country over the next two to three days, with temperatures expected to jump into double digits.Following a cold Saturday - with the mercury hovering between 5 and 8 degrees - parts of the midlands and west could enjoy highs of 13 degrees from Sunday.It is forecast to be fresher in the east and south, with winds coming off the Irish and Celtic Seas, but temperatures should still rise to 11 and 12 degrees in parts.The conditions are expected to last until Tuesday when rain is predicted to move across the country."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Defence forces tents have been set up as a testing centre for Covid-19. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe number of confirmed coronavirus patients in the Republic has risen to 785 after 102 newly discovered cases were confirmed on Saturday evening.This means the cases in Ireland have more than doubled in the last three days and comes at a time when the Government’s response to the crisis is coming under criticism from the opposition.The Government was scrambling this weekend to amend its €203 per week pandemic unemployment payment scheme which Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has admitted is likely to be insufficient for many people.More than 140,000 people have lost their jobs in the State so far as a result of restrictions introduced to curb the virus. DCU economics lecturer Tony Foley said on Saturday the final job loss total will exceed the 300,000 lost during the economic crash around the banking crisis.While the existing restrictions have caused huge economic upheaval nationally, and at a time when the global economy is undergoing similar upheaval, the HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry repeated on Saturday that there was as yet no need for additional measures, if those in place were property adhered to.He said 10,000 people have now been tested in the Republic and there are now 32 test centres operational, meaning that the waiting times for testing and receiving results should fall.Mr Donohoe said on Friday night that\u0026nbsphe accepted that for many people the €203 per week pandemic unemployment payment is not enough\u0026nbsp“and we need to consider that, but we need to do something really quickly for those at risk of losing their jobs”.ProposalIn the interim, the Government has announced changes to its existing financial support arrangements, which would allow employers to top up the Covid-19 unemployment payment\u0026nbspoffered by the State.Sources said Ministers were now looking at a broader scheme similar to measures being introduced elsewhere in Europe and the UK, where the government has committed to pay 80 per cent of wages, up to £2,500 (€2,700) per month, for people out of work as a result of the pandemic.While acknowledging the concerns around the €203 payment, Mr Donohoe said: “We have to be highly responsive. None of us could have imagined something like this could have happened as quickly as it did.Mr Donohoe’s Cabinet colleague and Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty on Saturday also accepted the Government’s €203 Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment was insufficient for those who have lost incomes due to the crisis.Different approachSpeaking to RTÉ radio, Ms Doherty said the payment was an emergency aid and said the Government recognises something different is now required.She said her department was working on a new approach over the weekend and said she hoped Mr Donohoe would be in a position to announce the details in the coming days.Trade unions are calling for up to 75 per cent of an employee’s wages to be covered by the Government with the remainder covered by employers.Fianna Fail has criticised the Government’s overall response to the pandemic and in particular the emergency payment, saying it does not come close to meeting the needs of people who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic.The party’s finance spokesperson Michael McGrath said the Government must focus on designing a scheme that enables people to receive as much of their income as possible for this temporary period.Mr McGrath - whose party is involved with government formation talks with Fine Gael - also criticised the Government’s overall response to the crisis, describing it as “piecemeal, underwhelming and poorly executed”.He said it was not tenable to expect those who have lost their job to survive on €203 per week “while waiting weeks for even basic child dependant or adult dependant top-ups”.Pubs will be shutMeanwhile, the Minister for Health has said pubs that remain open in defiance of the Government’s advice to close for at least two weeks during the coronavirus pandemic will be shut down under new emergency powers signed into law on Friday.Simon Harris said he has heard rumours of pubs not following the public health advice and he had seen video clips on social media of pubs “beginning to open in various fashion.”“We will shut you down if you are a pub that is remaining open, you are letting down the people of this country, you are also letting down your fellow publicans who are helping out and complying at great difficulty to them and their staff at a very challenging time,” he said on Saturday.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209124.1584880733!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus hse doubling bed capacity as irish cases rise to 785","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTraffic police personnel hold placards on a deserted road during a one-day nationwide Janata (civil) curfew imposed as a preventive measure against the Covid-19 coronavirus, in Hyderabad on Sunday.

It said it and was looking to reduce the waiting period for a test in the coming days.The HSE said it has 32 test centres around the country and is working towards having 50 in place which would assist in tackling the backlog in people waiting for a test. Around 10,000 people have been tested in Ireland for the virus to date.The HSE said there are now 177 people in hospital with the coronavirusCovid 19, a rise from 151 on Saturday morning.\u0026nbspMs O’Connor said 29 of these were in intensive care units.However, she said there was capacity in the hospital system to deal with growing numbers of patients with Covid 19.She said there were 2,243 vacant beds in the hospital system including 173 ICU beds.She also said the HSE is adding an extra 10,000 beds to the Irish hospital system to deal with an anticipated surge in patients.The HSE also said the number of intensive care unit beds - including beds in private hospitals - would rise to 500.DoubledThere are 785 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Republic and the virus has claimed three lives here. The Department of Health said 102 new cases were reported on Saturday.Cases in Ireland have more than doubled in the last three days and comes at a time when the Government’s response to the crisis is coming under criticism from the opposition.The HSE is also in the process of setting up field hospitals where those who are less acutely sick can be cared for without visiting a hospital.In terms of the procurement of medical equipment to combat the pandemic, the HSE said it had secured an additional ventilators - required by those suffering breathing difficulties as a result of Covid-19 - and said a further 1,000 will be delivered over the coming weeks.The executive is anticipating the delivery of a large consignment of personal protective equipment shortly, including 11 million masks, a million goggles, 400,000 gowns and suits.The Government was scrambling this weekend to amend its €203 per week pandemic unemployment payment scheme which Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has admitted is likely to be insufficient for many people.Job lossesMore than 140,000 people have lost their jobs in the State so far as a result of restrictions introduced to curb the virus.

Residents of a Dublin inner-city community have started a novel form of bingo to wile away the hours while the country is effectively in lockdown and people are being asked to practice social distancing.Up to 60 residents in the Canon Mooney Gardens flat complex in Ringsend played bingo from their balconies or doors with compere Michael Larkin broadcasting from a public address system outside on Friday.The complex has a lot of elderly residents and is also home to some families.The bingo event was organised by staff from the Ringsend and Irishtown Community Centre (RICC).Such was its success, and the response it received on social media, the idea is being extended to other flat complexes in the area.“We were trying to come up with ways to connect the community while maintaining social distancing,” said RICC staff member Jennifer Betts.“The flats are a great place and people can come out to their door. As a community centre we are trying to be the focal point for people locally.”The RICC has been delivering free dinners to the older community, provided by Avolon Aircraft Leasing, Artizan Food and Joanne’s The Bridge Café and checking in on those who are isolated and maintaining an online presence with baking and poetry competitions.RICC manager Lorraine Barry said she was “so humbled and proud of our community” at a trying time.“We want our community to know that the centre and its wonderful staff are on hand to support our community in any way that we can,” she added.“So we are urging people who may have any further creative ideas to keep us connected in a safe way, whilst adhering to social distancing, to get in touch.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209119.1584862928!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus there is literally no way out says irish man stranded in peru","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGearóid McKendrick at Machu Picchu on March 16th, the day Peru announced national lockdownWhen Peru announced its national coronavirus lockdown on March 16th Galway native Gearóid McKendrick (28) was up Machu Picchu without a phone signal and so oblivious to the sudden end of his holiday.“It was not until we woke up in the hostel the next morning that we heard the lockdown had been announced and we had until midnight to get out of the country,” says the IT worker who has been backpacking around South America since December.Immediately he attempted to contact Air Canada which whom he was due to fly home from Colombia next month: “I called and sent them emails but still haven’t been able to get through.”Efforts to contact his travel insurance company to see if it would cover the extra expense of a new flight home also proved fruitless. “I’ve had no response from them either so I am kind of at a loss at what to do,” he says, speaking from the Cusco hostel where he been holed up all week.He then tried to get a flight out with Colombian carrier Avianca but that proved impossible as its Cusco office was overwhelmed by people with the same idea. There was not enough time to get a bus out of Peru before borders closed or even as far as the capital Lima, 24 hours away by road.It was a remarkable development in a country that seemed little concerned with the Covid-19 pandemic when McKendrick entered Peru on March 10th. He is one of an estimated 100 or so Irish travellers stuck in the Andean nation that the Tánaiste Simon Coveney says the Government is working on bringing home. “The Irish people here are not expecting to get a free flight home or anything like that,” he is keen to emphasise. “We are more than willing to pay a reasonable amount. The issue is that there is literally no way out and there is no flight for us to get.”At one stage it looked like an Avianca charter flight would be organised to fly the stranded Irish out at more than US$3,500 (€3,250) a ticket, a fare McKendrick would have struggled to pay. But that plan has so far not materialised.He has been in touch with the Irish consulate in Peru and the embassy in neighbouring Chile and despite getting a daily email from the Department of Foreign Affairs, McKendrick says the situation is frustrating: “I understand they are doing everything they can to help us. But it is just the lack of information in terms of what is the solution for getting us home.”He is also worried that any eventual flight will require him to get to Lima when the lockdown means “making it to Cusco airport no mind Lima is a challenge”. McKendrick is the only Irish citizen in his hostel where he is one of 15 foreign tourists, including two Welsh friends he has been travelling with for the last few weeks. Police are patrolling the streets outside to ensure people are only going outdoors to buy food and medicine and they are even reportedly entering other hostels in the city to enforce social distancing.The group in the hostel, which also includes Australians and Dutch travellers, are being well looked after with the owners serving up breakfast every day and are sharing information and organising movie nights to help pass the time.McKendrick is also in regular contact with his family back home. But as time passes he is increasingly concerned about the delay in resolving his situation: “I have an underlying medical condition which I take prescription medication for and I have a three week supply left. Stuff like that is on your mind the whole time.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209111.1584827051!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"naval vessel to become coronavirus testing centre","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe LÉ Samuel Beckett berthed on Sir John Rogerson’s Quay in Dublin.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209123.1584880733!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"number of coronavirus cases globally passes 300 000","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA florist hands a bouquet of flowers to a health worker outside the Burgos Hospital on Saturday in Burgos, in northern Spain. Photograph: Cesar MansoAFP The global number of coronavirus cases has doubled in a week to more than 300,000, it was reported on Sunday morning.There have been more than 13,000 deaths and around 96,000 people have recovered from the virus.Here is a synopsis of the main developments in the Covid-19 crisis around the world on Sunday.ItalyItaly will close almost all non-essential business activities for 15 days in a bid to arrest the spread of the coronavirus and allow the economy to restart as soon as possible. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte said in a televised news conference that supermarkets and pharmacies would remain open along with banks and post offices.Italy had a record 793 new deaths, raising the total to 4,825 on Saturday. In Lombardy, where Italy is hardest-hit, authorities clamped down further, even going so far as to ban jogging.SpainThe Spanish government said on Saturday it would do whatever was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic and warned that “the worst is yet to come” after the national toll surpassed 1,300 deaths and reached close to 25,000 cases. The second-worst outbreak in Europe showed no sign of slowing as the death toll jumped by more than 300 from the previous day. Intensive care units are filling up in some hospitals.Prime minister Pedro Sanchez’s leftist government a week ago declared a 15-day state of emergency nationwide barring people from all but essential outings. Mr Sanchez praised the “exemplary” response and said he had no plans to strengthen the restrictions, which he called the toughest in Europe. The prime minister also made no mention of extending the state of emergency, though he warned of tough weeks ahead. Spain’s death toll jumped to 1,326 from 1,002 the day before, according to Health Ministry data released on Saturday.AustraliaAustralian prime minister Scott Morrison on Sunday ordered many venues, including pubs, casinos, gyms and cinemas, to close from midday Monday to combat coronavirus after many people appeared to disregard health warnings and congregated in large numbers in recent days. After an initial relatively slow spread, the number of infections in Australia has risen quickly, climbing to 1,098 confirmed cases as of Sunday with seven deaths linked to the illness. “I am deeply regretful that those workers and those business owners who will be impacted by this decision will suffer the economic hardship that undoubtedly they will now have to face,” Mr Morrison said in a national address on Sunday evening. Restaurants, cafes and catering businesses will be restricted to delivery and take-away services, Mr Morrison said.Earlier, Australia has unveiled a 66.4 billion Australian dollar (€30bn) stimulus package in a bid to ward off a recession and safeguard employment from the coronavirus pandemic. The package includes cash payments for eligible small businesses and welfare recipients. The total economic assistance packages so far total almost 10 per cent of the country’s GDP.UKIn the UK, the confirmed death toll has risen by 56 in the space of a day to 233, the National Health Service said on Saturday. Some 72,818 people had been tested as of 9am Saturday morning, with 5,018 positive, up from 3,983 the previous day. The UK has been stepping up measures to fight the virus that have so far been less stringent than elsewhere in Europe. People identified as belonging to one or more of the at-risk groups include those who have received organ transplants, those living with severe respiratory conditions or specific cancers, and some receiving certain types of drug treatments. They will be contacted by their doctor strongly advising them to stay at home for a period of at least 12 weeks. “If you receive a letter it is vitally important that you act on it for your own protection, don’t attend any gatherings of friends or families and don’t go out for shopping, leisure or travel,” said Paul Johnson, director at Public Health England.IndiaHundreds of millions of Indians stayed indoors on Sunday, heeding prime minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to citizens to self-isolate as authorities battled to contain the fast-spreading epidemic. At least 324 people have so far contracted the disease and four deaths were reported in India due to coronavirus, according to official data on Sunday. While the curfew is voluntary and is not an outright ban on the movement of people, Mr Modi’s national appeal for social distancing has helped dramatically reduce the number of people taking to India’s densely crowded streets.Experts have warned that the country’s cases are growing at rates seen during the early stages of the outbreak in other countries, which subsequently reported exponential increases in infections. With over 1.3 billion people, India is trying to battle a pandemic with limited resources.The country suspended passenger train services across the country until March 31st as the government tries to curb the spread of thecoronavirus outbreak. The railways ministry said passenger rail will stop with immediate effect though freight services will continue, according to a statement on Sunday.USUS president Donald Trump said negotiators in Congress and his administration are “very close” to agreement on a coronavirus economic-relief plan that his economic adviser said will aim to boost the US economy by about $2 trillion (€1.85 tr). The economic measure is intended to to “keep companies together, keep workers paid, so they can live and sustain,” Mr Trump said at a White House briefing. “We’re asking people not to work because we have to stay away from each other,” he said, adding that the hope is to “win with as few lives lost as possible.”ChinaThe Chinese city of Wuhan, where the global pandemic was first detected, went a fourth consecutive day on Sunday without reporting any new or suspected cases of the virus.Elsewhere, the country reported 46 new cases over the previous 24 hours, 45 of them coming from overseas. The health ministry did not say where the domestic case was found.Another six deaths were also reported, one in Wuhan, four in the surrounding province of Hubei and one elsewhere.China has now recorded a total of 81,054 cases and 3,261 deaths. A total of 72,244 people have been declared cured and released from hospital.Wuhan must go 14 straight days without a new case in order for draconian travel restrictions to be lifted and the city remains isolated from the rest of the province, which is itself closed off to the rest of the country. Even while social distancing and quarantines for new arrivals remain the norm, China is striving to restore activity in the world’s second-largest economy.Wuhan is a centre of China’s crucial auto industry and a special train carrying more than 1,000 employees of Dongfeng Motor Corporation arrived in the city on Saturday for the first time since the outbreak. All were sent directly by bus to factories or residential communities.SingaporeSingapore said it will fully shut its borders from Tuesday after recording its first two deaths.The city-state has banned visitors from several countries and requires all short-term visitors to observe a 14-day home quarantine. But the government said that from Tuesday all short-term visitors will be barred from entering or transiting through the country. The city-state of nearly 6 million people has recorded 432 cases so far. On Saturday, it reported that a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and an Indonesian visitor, 64, have succumbed to the virus.South KoreaSouth Korea reported 98 more cases of the new coronavirus on Sunday, taking the total to 8,897.Deaths increased by two to 104, according to the state-run Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.First cases and first deathsThe Palestinian Health Ministry has announced the first two cases of the coronavirus in the Gaza Strip. The ministry said early on Sunday that the cases were two people who returned recently from Pakistan.Colombia has reported its first death from the new coronavirus. Officials said he was a 58-year-old taxi driver who had driven tourists from Italy, one of the countries worst hit by the virus.The Romanian government confirmed on Sunday the first death in the country due to coronavirus. The deceased was a 67-year-old man who had been suffering from terminal cancer. –Reuters, PA, BloombergEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: 1.5 million people told \u0026#39stay home for at least 12 weeks\u0026#39 as UK braces for Italian-style crisisComment: There is still time to change course and take the attack to our remorseless enemy Comment: Now we are in unprecedented territory, our old fads seem very decadent indeedWhat is in the Coronavirus Bill?

The wristband is connected to a phone app that allows the authorities to track the wearer’s location and any quarantine breaches. South Korea, which has managed to slow the spread of the disease after cases exploded in February, from Sunday at midnight will introduce a compulsory Covid-19 test for anyone entering the country from Europe.Last week the authorities warned that expats caught ignoring anti-coronavirus directions – including requests to be tested, treated or quarantined - could face deportation or an entry ban.China first reported imported infections in late February, and has since confirmed nearly 200, many of them Chinese expatriates fleeing coronavirus outbreaks around the world. Neighbourhood committees and police are conducting house calls to ensure people now self-isolating are abiding by the rules. Taiwan, an island of 23 million just 81 miles from China, has been widely praised for its tackling of the virus, but last week it saw cases more than double to 135, with most linked to arrivals from Europe and North Africa. The news has sparked a fresh round of public anxiety.Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwanese president, warned on Thursday that the next 14 days would be critical to virus prevention efforts and warned of “heavy fines” for hoarding. The health minister said the main focus would be on avoiding community spread of the disease. All arriving passengers at Taipei’s main Taoyuan airport have faced hours of queuing to undergo health screening and to ensure compliance with quarantine controls.  The authorities have warned that quarantine violations may result in huge fines and the offender’s name being publicised. Merle Hermanns, 20, a German backpacker who was mid-flight from Bangkok in Thailand when Taiwan announced new 14-day quarantine rules.At the airport she was ushered to a taxi stand assigned to quarantine cases where her luggage was disinfected and then taken to a government approved hotel.Stuck in a windowless room under lockdown, she said she was keeping positive by passing the time with Netflix and chatting to family and friends. The authorities check on her location every day. Peggy Wang, a Taiwanese American who arrived from New York on Thursday, is anxiously waiting out her quarantine period until April 3 at her elderly parents’ home at their insistence. She said she had confined herself to one bedroom, and only communicates with them by phone, disinfecting any doorknobs or surfaces she touches. Her parents wear face masks in the house. “We are like virus refugees now, trying to stay safe from the virus. I can only imagine what it would be like to be a refugee from a war. I feel for everyone,” she said. Asian governments are warning their citizens against fatigue and complacency in the long-term battle against the virus as the second round of infections begins. Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary epidemiology at Hong Kong’s City University, told the  that newly implemented quarantine rules should “reduce the risk to an acceptable level.”He added: “I also believe that very much in contrast to the general public in Europe, USA and Australia, people in Hong Kong are fairly diligently applying social distancing and other hygienic measures, and that will reduce opportunity for secondary spread significantly.”But Professor Pfeiffer questioned how long such measures would be possible as businesses suffered, creating “horrendous social and economic costs” that would haunt future generations. “We cannot all just literally ‘turn the lights off’ by fencing us all in, in the belief that we will be secure,” he said. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus advice ignored almost quarter 25 34 year olds poll","story":"Almost one in four 25 to 34-year-olds are failing to follow the Government\u0027s most basic advice on slowing the spread of Covid-19, according to a poll.A survey of 2,000 people in Britain exposed a significant ide in the approach of different generations to the pandemic.Only 76 per cent of those aged 25 to 34 said they were washing their hands more frequently, in line with official advice, compared to 90 per cent of over 55s. The 25-34 age bracket also contained the highest proportion of any age group (7 per cent) saying they had yet to take any additional precautions at all.The findings come after Boris Johnson ordered the closure of all pubs, bars, gyms and nightclubs, amid fears that both younger and older people were unwittingly spreading the virus while socialising.A second survey by Imperial College London\u0027s Patient Experience Research Centre also warns half of us (48 per cent) believe we will get infected at some point.Of those surveyed in the ORB poll, 72 per cent said they would be willing to sacrifice some of their human rights if doing so helped to prevent the spread of the disease - a proportion that was almost 10 per cent lower than the average in 10 countries polled.However the ORB poll in the UK found that only 71 per cent of adults were staying in their homes or taking part in less social interaction - a key element of the Government\u0027s strategy to slow the spread of coronavirus.Among those aged between 45 and 54, only 60 per cent said they were carrying out less social interaction or remaining in their homes. For those aged 65 or over the figure rose to 84 per cent.A further generational ide was highlighted by a finding that almost one in four 18-24 year olds (24 per cent), and 19 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds, believe the threat from coronavirus has been exaggerated, compared to just 13 per cent of over 65s.Overall, 86 per cent of British respondents said they were washing their hands more frequently, with 18-24-year-olds slightly above average at 87 per cent. However the figure dropped to 76 per cent among those aged between 25 and 34.In Italy, one of the worst affected countries, 87 per cent of respondents to a separate online poll of 1,000 people said they were washing their hands more frequently, compared to 85 per cent in France and 79 per cent in the Netherlands, based on identical surveys.In Pakistan, which reported a sharp rise in infections last week, only 43 per cent said they were washing their hands more frequently. In Turkey the figure was 42 per cent.The proportions of adults staying at home or taking part in less social interaction were significantly higher in Italy and France, at 93 per cent and 84 per cent respectively. However both countries imposed more draconian restrictions on the movements of their citizens than in the UK, where only 71 per cent said they had been staying at home or socialising less when the poll was carried out between Wednesday and Friday.Of six possible precautions intended to protect themselves from the virus, British women were more likely to be carrying them out than men.Some 89 per cent of women said they were washing their hands more frequently, compared to 83 per cent of men. Meanwhile 73 per cent of women were remaining in their homes or interacting less, with the figure dropping to 68 per cent among men.In Italy, 93 per cent of respondents were prepared to sacrifice some of their human rights to help prevent the spread of the disease, compared to 94 per cent in Austria, 91 per cent in the Netherlands, 84 per cent in France and 71 per cent in Germany and Switzerland.Confidence in the UK Government\u0027s handling of the pandemic was lower than in leaders in all but one of the other nine countries, which also included the Philippines. Only 49 per cent of those polled in Britain said they thought the Government was handling the crisis well, compared to 72 per cent of Italians asked about their government, and 52 per cent of French respondents asked about theirs.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus diary postcard locked down paris","story":"As our evening flight descends towards Paris after a rather ill-timed family trip to Portugal, I spy headlights streaming the other way as thousands flee to provincial bolt holes with cars full of kids and food.As the front door shuts, President Emmanuel Macron announces two weeks of home confinement as of midday Tuesday. He invites the French to read - a touching testament to Gallic faith in culture but will they let us eat cake?We are at war, says Macron. Only yesterday, Parisians were lounging in parks and soaking up the unseasonable March sun. Tonight, it has set.Central Paris is eerily quiet. Could it be a sign the French are taking the rules seriously?The City of Lights is finally picture postcard, if for the wrong reasons.“The good news is half the Parisians have left,” quips one French friend, half-serious. The media are full of stories of provincials bemoaning the Parisian invasion.Under the new rules, no-one goes out unless their job is “vital” or they require food, medical help or physical exercise. Failure to comply comes with a €135 fine.But near my flat, the eastern Belleville market is bustling with unconcerned shoppers.Also open are cavistes, fromageries and bakers. There will be no bread riots nor a shortage of Burgundy! Perhaps things aren’t that bad.Day two of lockdown.With eastern France reaching Italian desperation levels over “saturated” hospitals and stark choices of who to save, the French are starting to learn the limits of their cherished health service.A call comes in from London for “positive” coronavirus tales.The best is the now nightly applause the French offer their long-suffering doctors and health workers. It’s the Gallic twist on Italians singing to neighbours.My family opens the window at 8pm to a chorus of cheers and clapping not heard since France won the World Cup. “Moved to tears,” writes one nurse on Twitter. “I will go and treat patients with a warmer heart!”Desperate for fresh air, I don cycling gear and head out with a form justifying “physical exercise”. Does a 40km round trip up the Canal Saint-Martin count as “close to home”?In the final furlong, the police wave me down. Cycling as a sport is banned, they frown.Chastened, I return to the workstation to learn that France faces a month of lockdown at the least. With hospitalisations doubling every day, the country is “taking confinement too lightly”, says Mr Macron. Noted.Just as my spirits flag, friends invite me to a special online aperitif. At 6pm, my screen shows six grinning Parisians sipping beer. Turns out the “tele-apéro” has become an overnight hit, almost an act of French patriotism.France is clearly behind the curve on education 2.0. With two kids facing six weeks of confinement, so far only one teacher has sent a recorded audio lecture.Finally, today, both have an online lesson.My 14-year old daughter squeals after joining the wrong class. My 16-year old son has four hours of maths and biology. “It’s actually easier to concentrate as you don’t get the usual trouble-makers,” he says.They are certainly used to disruptions. How many classes have they missed this year over teachers’ strikes and school blockades? Could home education be the silver lining of confinement?Coronavirus feels suddenly much closer to home doctors have just told my French sister-in-law that her 80-year old father won’t pull through.Infected during a church service in his tiny Breton village, he spent ten days in a coma then regained consciousness but has abrubtly declined.I ring my 81-year old dad holed up near Carcassonne. You are being careful, I ask? Yes we have enough food for weeks, he says. We only go to supermarkets at oldies’ hour.I get a WhatsApp video call from an old friend in London who’s walking in the park to show me a bit of greenery.As a Paris colleague remarked, one week on, the UK is where France was a week ago: it feels like we are living your future.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus private schools plead parents not withdraw fees","story":"Parents must resist the temptation to withdraw school fees after pupils were sent home during the coronavirus crisis, the Independent Schools Council has warned.Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the ICC and a former headmaster of Harrow School, urged embittered parents to remember that private schools will face the same risk of closure as other small businesses if they lose money.The warning comes after the Government ordered the closure of schools this week until further notice in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19.It\u0027s probably going to get messy but it will messy in many areas of life, Mr Lenon told The Sunday . Independent schools are small businesses and they are in the same boat as everyone else to a certain extent.As far as the year 11 and year 13 are concerned, with public exams cancelled, a lot depends on whether the schools feel they need to collect evidence of academic progress from those students over the next two months particularly.The details have not yet been announced by Ofqual, but we can be sure that statements like \u0027you can use mock exam results\u0027 are bound to be inadequate because some mock exams happened months ago and some teachers quite deliberately mark down for mocks.Many people may have made good progress since the mocks so it could be felt that schools will want to carry on setting a marking work and delivering online lessons for the next two or three months, in which case the teachers will need to be employed, the teachers will need to be paid, and that\u0027s a justification for a fee.An online petition has been set up calling for exam boards not to use predicted grades in GCSE and A-Level exams, which have been cancelled. It argues this is unfair for a significant number of students, who may have the potential to exceed their predicted grades.  Many schools plan to carry on working through the curriculum remotely using Skype and other online learning tools.Mr Lenon said this would come as a relief to many parents who are desperate for their children to have something to do, but highlighted that funding is crucial.This is partly a mental health issue and schools that can provide activities on a regular basis will have to staff them and those staff will need to be paid, he said.In the end, a bit will depend on the ability of schools being able to demonstrate that they are doing the best that they can. A bit will depend on the patience and generosity of parents, but schools intend to keep going as far as they reasonably can.As the first full week of school closures begins on Monday, children can sit in on virtual assemblies in the mornings, followed by live lessons with teachers and video workouts with PE staff.Some schools are checking in on their pupils twice a week on Skype to make sure they don\u0027t fall behind with their studies. Others are working on light-hearted podcasts to lift their spirits while they are isolated from their friends.Investment in textbooks to facilitate home learning is also being increased, with thousands of pounds worth of textbooks being distributed to make sure children are still writing things down and not getting too immersed in technology.Pearson, the education publisher, is offering free subscriptions to online content for schools, colleges and higher education providers in a bid to stop pupils from falling behind.Andrew O\u0027Neill, headteacher of All Saints Catholic College, a mixed secondary school in North Kensington, told The Sunday : We are using Microsoft Teams to live teach the students and every day teachers will set tasks for them.Every morning there will be a short assembly for the students to motivate them about what is happening. Our PE staff are going to do daily live video workouts for the students to follow.Last week we bought £7,000 worth of resources which are going to be sent home to supplement the online work. Students still need to write things down and we are trying to create a balance between screen time and working time.Concerns have been raised about vulnerable children who are remote learning.The NSPCC has warned that headteachers should provide a safe space for children they consider to be at risk in the coming weeks - even those who don\u0027t meet the official criteria setting out which pupils can continue to attend school from Monday.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"loss sense smell taste could symptoms new coronavirus","story":"A loss of sense of smell and taste could be symptoms of the new coronavirus, according to a leading ear, nose, or throat specialist.Professor Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT UK, a body representing ear, nose and throat surgeons, said covid-19 patients are presenting with these symptoms, even when they do not have the other more common symptoms of fever and cough.He advised that people in the UK should self isolate if they experience these new symptoms. In young patients, they do not have any significant symptoms such as the cough and fever, but they may have just the loss of sense of smell and taste, which suggests that these viruses are lodging in the nose, he told Sky News.ENT UK also released a statement, co-signed by Professor Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, saying that isolating people with a loss of sense of smell but no other symptoms for seven days could reduce the number of people who are infecting others with the virus, without realising it.The statement said: “There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that significant numbers of patients with proven covid-19 infection have developed anosmiahyposmia (loss of sense of smell).“There have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms – this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases.”The Department of Health and Social Care said that people should not self isolate unless they have a fever or a new continuous cough.National Medical Director of NHS England Stephen Powis Stephen Powis said: “As with any virus that gives an infection of the upper respiratory tract - the nose and the throat - there are a range of symptoms. The two most common symptoms by far are cough and fever, and that is exactly why we are asking people to self isolate based on those symptoms.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 22 march 2020","story":"A woman is seen wearing a mask embellished with petals in the central Iraqi holy city of NajafCoronavirus latest news: 1.5 million people told \u0026#39stay home for at least 12 weeks\u0026#39 as UK braces for Italian-style crisisComment: There is still time to change course and take the attack to our remorseless enemy Comment: Now we are in unprecedented territory, our old fads seem very decadent indeedWhat is in the Coronavirus Bill?

Samuel Pepys it ain’t. There are no raucous ballads in taverns and vanishingly few extramarital assignations with pot-boys in back-alleys, or whatever the female version of Pepys’s escapades would be. Entries are rather more trivial, of the “Sasha texted” or “Call from Mum” variety.Alongside signs of the virus’s advance – friends taken ill, lying awake to the blaring of ambulance sirens – there is the banality of life cooped up procrastination, fruitless attempts to resist gorging on the block of Cheddar in the fridge through sheer boredom (though Pepys, who famously tried to shield a valuable Parmesan from the flames of the Great Fire by burying it in his back garden, might have empathised).While my mundane musings are unlikely to fascinate future generations, something compelled me to document this moment. The adage “History never looks like history when you are living through it” isn’t true of coronavirus. Fraught though this period is, we are keenly aware that these are extraordinary times.Perhaps this is why the virus demands historical comparisons. Many invoke the Spanish flu or the Plague, despite our superior hygiene, medicine and communications. For Pepys, the plague year was one of the happiest of his life. As the bodies piled up, he enjoyed a euphoric few months he was elected to the Royal Society, acquired a 12ft telescope and revelled in his sexual encounters. But, like us, Pepys was constantly worried about the disease’s spread. He lost friends, and kept a nervous eye on death rates, tracking the disease’s progress towards London The plague is got to Amsterdam, brought by a ship from Argier, The plague is very hot still, and encreases among the Dutch, he noted in 1664. Others have likened the current pandemic to the Second World War. The trouble with this analogy is that “Blitz spirit” hinged on community, whereas the coronavirus has the unpleasant effect of destroying many of our social networks. And where’s the heroism? Save for those fighting the disease on the front line and keeping essential services and food supplies going, our patriotic duty (staying in) is inherently dull. It’s hard to channel Douglas Bader or Vera Lynn when you’re sitting around in your pyjamas.Coronavirus, then, is its own beast. But one thing remains certain. Looking back at when history was made is always fascinating just as living through it is always trying. Perhaps one day, my children will ask: “What did you do during the coronavirus, Mummy?” To which I will reply: “Well, darling, I rearranged my bookshelves and binge‑watched Netflix.” Give me a few months and the answer will be more Pepysian: “I developed gout for my country.”But however pedestrian the day-to-day reality, we are living through a supreme test of our national and global mettle. Events like last week’s will be discussed in 100 years’ time, just as dates like 1665 or 1918 remain the highlights of preceding centuries.

The value of sterling also slumped by some 4 per cent against the dollar on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level since the collapse of 1985.In a statement the bank attributed this to investors seeking the safety and liquidity of shorter term debt.“Over recent days, and in common with a number of other advanced economy bond markets, conditions in the UK gilt market have deteriorated as investors have sought shorter-dated instruments that are closer substitutes for highly liquid central bank reserves,” it said.In a conference call with journalists after the decision the bank’s new governor Andrew Bailey said that markets had been “bordering on disorderly”, persuading the bank to restart its asset purchases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightforward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway.

Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightforward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. It will cost £5.99 for a monthly subscription, or £59.99 to sign up for a year.Which TV shows will be available to stream on Disney+?In its first year, Disney+ will have more than 25 original TV series, alongside a library of more than 7,500 episodes of shows.The service will feature five new shows set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, WandaVision, What If…?, Loki and Hawkeye.Disney remakes have made over $7 billion since 2010Loki: Tom Hiddleston to star in Marvel TV spin-off on Disney+Star Wars shows are also being developed for Disney+, including The Clone Wars, The Mandalorian and an untitled series revolving around Rogue One’s Cassian Andor.All 30 seasons of The Simpsons will be available to watch from launch day, as well as all the series of Malcolm in the Middle.Shows also in the works include spin-offs of High School Musical, Monsters, Inc,\u0026nbspThe Sandlot and\u0026nbspLove, Simon.Which films will be available to stream on Disney+?Within the first year of Disney+, the service will feature all of the movies in the Star Wars series, including the original trilogy.Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame will also both be available to stream, as well as every Pixar movie and all of the Disney classics, including The Lion King and Aladdin.The live-action version of Lady and the Tramp, Anna Kendrick’s Santa Claus movie Noelle, Togo, Timmy Failure, Stargirl and The Phineas and Ferb Movie, will all also be available.Approximately 500 movies are expected to be available to watch on the service when it launches, including classics such as Mary Poppins\u0026nbspand The Princess Diaries.We may earn commission from some of the links in this article, but we never allow this to influence our content.Disney+\u0026nbsplaunches in the UK on 24 March 2020.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It looks outwardly near-identical to the current model, but it offers better value, increased storage and faster performance. But even these things are not the game-changer: that’s the new keyboard.The pricing first: where the previous MacBook Air, on sale until just days ago, cost £1,099 and came with 128GB of internal storage, the entry-level Air is now £100 less, £999, and has 256GB of storage. There’s also a 512GB model available, with a faster processor, for £1,299. There are still lots of laptops out there for much less money, but this price represents good value. Note that Apple has education pricing for those in class as students or teachers, so it’s possible to get that price even lower if you qualify.The look is the same as before: sleek and classy. It comes in three colours, silver, space grey and gold. The space grey is the best: solid and businesslike without looking boring, though the gold, warm with a peachy hint to it, is also a head-turner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe build quality of the MacBook Air is exceptional, an all-aluminium casing that’s sculpted to the slimmest of edges to make it easy to pick up. Like all MacBooks, and unlike many other laptops, you can open it with one hand, the build is so perfectly balanced. Other machines require a finger to hold down the keyboard as you open the lid or the whole thing swings up as it opens.This MacBook Air continues to have a power button with Touch ID built in – a fingerprint scanner that ensures your computer screen locks when you’re away from it and only unlocks to your finger. Apple Watch wearers can also use their smart timepiece to unlock the MacBook Air, which is cool. Both mechanisms feel intimate and secure.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The Air has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports. For other connections, such as USB-A, you’ll need an adaptor. That’s not always convenient, though it gets easier all the time as more accessories switch to USB-C, and it helps to keep the Air thin.The MacBook Air has been preposterously slim and light since it was first unveiled by Steve Jobs in 2008 when the then-CEO slid it out of an envelope to an admiring crowd. It was so much thinner and lighter than the competition that it drew gasps of excitement. Over the next decade it slipped behind, especially in terms of the screen resolution, though that’s been fixed. Now, the 13in display is bright, rich and superbly high-resolution.Apple releases iPad with 3D scanner and a trackpadApple and Netflix pull out of SXSW over coronavirus fearsAnd then there’s the new keyboard. Apple keyboards were traditionally outstanding, using a scissor-switch mechanism, with lots of travel and a great feel. Then, a few years ago, Apple changed to a whole new system, using a butterfly mechanism. The first-generation of this was quite noisy, but this was overcome in subsequent versions. But then, problems arose which led to keyboards being replaced as users complained that there wasn’t the same reliability.Last year, on the MacBook Pro 16in, Apple introduced the Magic Keyboard – a name taken from its desktop wireless keyboard – which changed everything. The new keys were quieter, more stable and had more travel – a full 1mm. That’s not quite as much as the keys moved before the butterfly landed, when it was 1.2mm. But it was enough, and it was a revelation.It’s the same here. Using the new keyboard subtly transforms the typing experience. It’s not that the butterfly keys were bad: unless they failed, they worked well and were comfortable to use.But as soon as you use the new Magic Keyboard, you recognise how comfortable and inviting it is. The downside is it’s quite hard to go back. Having typed this review on the MacBook Air keys, I picked up a previous Air to make a comparison. As soon as I started typing, my fingers told me I was missing the new experience. The keys on the old Air, which I had used happily before, just couldn’t match the luxurious and satisfying feel of the new one. The gentle scoop on the top of each key that helps your fingers find the right place to touch, the crisper inidual backlighting to make typing in a less bright room a breeze and the clearer lettering on each key – all of which are small, subtle improvements that Apple has made with the Magic Keyboard – add up to something big.The processor has been improved on the latest models with a 1.1GHz dual-core Core i3 processor on the £999 model and a 1.1GHz quad-core Core i5 chip on the £1,299 version.In practical terms, this means that the Air is a real performer. Not that it was a slouch before, but it handles tasks easily. It’s true, the MacBook Pro is still the go-to laptop for those doing advanced video processing or running other power-hungry programs. But the Air is now very fast and effective. To the extent that many customers may ask whether they really need to spend £1,299 on the entry-level 13in MacBook Pro rather than a £999 MacBook Air that isn’t that far off. Sure, there are other extras in the Pro range, like the spiffy Touch Bar instead of function keys, and four Thunderbolt USB-C sockets instead of two on the Air, for instance.Battery life on the MacBook Air is exemplary: it just goes on and on all day where other laptops, including some MacBook Pro models, don’t last as long. It’s so good that you may not even think about checking how much charge is left in the battery. It gives a great feeling of peace of mind.The new MacBook Air is available for order now, with deliveries starting next week. It represents a big step forward for the super-slim Apple laptop, combining sumptuous good looks with real performance and, above all, an unbeatably appealing keyboard.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She had already been to her local branch of Iceland with a prepaid card in the days beforehand, but every time she had tried to pick up what she needed, she found the shelves empty. On her last attempt before arriving at the food bank, pandemonium had erupted in a scene more like\u0026nbspa US Black Friday electronics\u0026nbspsale\u0026nbspthan the opening of a\u0026nbspfrozen goods supermarket. “As soon as they opened the doors, everyone was just everywhere,”\u0026nbspthe woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Independent. “They were pulling stuff out of trolleys.\u0026nbspI just got my children and left.”Food banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseSharing the full story, not just the headlinesEight days earlier, before the UK was fully caught up in the\u0026nbspcoronavirus pandemic, more than 400\u0026nbspfood banks were asked by the Trussell Trust how they expected to respond.

But each food bank under their umbrella operates independently, reacting inidually to the pandemic. “It’s been genuinely humbling to see the response across the network,” Mr Lemon added. “They face some significant challenges and they, supported by brilliant staff at the Trussell Trust, have essentially been running to solve all of them at once.”Chiefly among them:\u0026nbspmore people appear to be in need. From April 2018 to March 2019, the most common reasons for visiting\u0026nbspa Trussell Trust food bank were insufficient income and difficulty with benefits. However, with schools\u0026nbspclosed and businesses put at risk by closures, food banks now believe new people will be visiting – those suddenly finding themselves jobless, and those with children on free school meals who ordinarily rely on holiday hunger programmes.Food banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusNurse unable to buy food makes tearful plea for end to panic-buying“Food banks were already running at capacity\u0026nbspbefore this hit,” Mr Lemon\u0026nbspadded. “Alongside that increased demand, we have issues around securing adequate food supply, you’ve got issues with the lack of volunteers. Also,\u0026nbspTrussell\u0026nbspTrust food banks work on a referral basis, so we’ve also got challenges around referral partners – people who normally assess people’s need and give them the vouchers...\u0026nbspAnd on top of all of that, they are needing to operate in epidemic conditions.”Lauren\u0026nbspTunnicliffe, manager of the Manchester Central food bank, said: “I think the concern is we’re going to see a lot of people who otherwise wouldn’t need the food bank – people who would generally consider themselves very secure, they’ve had jobs for a long time, and who provisions are in place for.”The branch, which was set up\u0026nbspby students and is close to\u0026nbspUniversity of Manchester buildings, has seen a 38 per cent increase in users over the last week – and expects the figure to increase.\u0026nbspBut a number of referral partners who had sent people to the food bank now appear to have closed without any formal announcement.While need has increased, so too has support – albeit while fluctuating with the public’s sense of concern. “We hit a really low point with our stock towards early March,”\u0026nbspMs Tunnicliffe, 22, added. “About two weeks ago we were saying, ‘Oh god we don’t have any food.’\u0026nbspWe can’t say for sure but we think it might have been just as the panic buying was starting, and just as people were getting preoccupied with coronavirus and seeing it as a threat to themselves, that I think our collection points at our supermarkets were a little forgotten about.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On social media, many operators have followed up on appeals with renewed calls for food, while many have said they are close to running out on core staples such as UHT milk. “The response has been massive,”\u0026nbspMs Tunicliffe noted, “but we’re a little bit worried about the sustainability of it because this is so open-ended at this stage. We don’t know whether we’re still going to be desperate in six weeks, or whether people are still going to be able to keep supporting us in six weeks – obviously they’re going to be concerned about themselves, there’s people that are losing their jobs, they’re not going to be able to afford to go and buy us food every single week.”With a cohort of young student volunteers, the site is expecting to remain well staffed throughout the crisis – unlike many food banks elsewhere reckoning with the government’s advice for\u0026nbspover-70s to consider self-isolating. “A large proportion of our volunteers are older and are quite rightly self-isolating, so that is an issue,”\u0026nbspMr Lemon said. In response, the charity has set up a new volunteering system on its website with a focus on connecting\u0026nbsppeople with the nearest operator, wherever they may be.\u0026nbspHowever, along with fewer volunteers, services offered by the charity are at risk – such as\u0026nbspthe cup of tea and chat that volunteers share with visitors. In latest guidance from the charity, volunteers are told to limit contact with the public by no longer allowing visitors to come inside –\u0026nbspinstead handing over food parcels at the door. “We’re seeing food banks completely changing the way that they operate overnight in order to tackle this,” Mr Lemon said. “Some of it’s quite unfortunate. Food banks pride themselves on their wraparound services –\u0026nbspthings like a cup of tea and a cake or a chat – but that’s unfortunately had to stop.”The impact of fewer volunteers, increased demand and fluctuating stocks has already proved to be too much for a small number of food banks, with some reducing their operating hours and others suspending services altogether. In Islington, a branch announced it would stop offering food parcels until further notice – citing limited supplies and staff shortages. The Trussell Trust has since said it is working with local agencies to help.However, Mr Lemon added, the virus has exposed flaws in the public safety net, which food banks have attempted to patch up. “It’s about government responsibility here and it comes down to the issue of increased demand,” Mr Lemon said.\u0026nbsp“There’s only so much that this network can take and it’s important that the government steps up and has a look at our social security system as its immediate priority to make sure that we’re able to cope.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These are the very people that we all need to look after perhaps us or our loved ones in the weeks to come.”When asked by\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspwhether measures would be taken to help food banks, enabling them to bulk buy, environment secretary George\u0026nbspEustice\u0026nbspacknowledged the problem and\u0026nbspsaid that talks were ongoing with supermarkets.How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Justin Byam Shaw, founder and deputy chairman of the Felix Project, which collects just-in-date and surplus food from supermarkets and restaurants to distribute to charities and schools across London, said many food banks had been forced to close due to a shortage in supply.“People are stockpiling and no longer wish to donate food.\u0026nbspFood banks rely on members of the public and that has dried up.\u0026nbspThey just can’t keep going,” he said.“For the first time in my lifetime we’re starting to see real hunger in London. It’s incredible that in the 21st century\u0026nbspwe are seeing actual hunger. It’s completely unprecedented.”Mr Byam\u0026nbspShaw said the impact of this drop in donations, as well as a reduction in volunteers due to illness and self-isolation, had been made more stark by the increase in demand.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You still have to pay rent and utility bills, food comes second,” he said.“And then you’ve got people who are self-isolating and a lot of them are elderly. Schools have closed, and although vulnerable children are allowed back in, there are others who we know don’t get good food provision in the holidays.”Discussions are said to be taking place\u0026nbspbetween the government and supermarkets about whether food banks might be able to access supplies\u0026nbspbefore shops open to the wider public, or\u0026nbspbe made exempt from\u0026nbsppurchase restrictions.Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust, the UK’s largest network of food banks, said the lack of food on supermarket shelves was a “huge issue” for the charity’s service providers.“Over this next week it will increasingly become a problem. While many of us have been able to think what do we get in, for people on very low incomes or no income at all, stockpiling isn’t\u0026nbspa possibility,” she said.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, BethlehemAppealing to the public for help, she added: “People should consider what they’re buying, and as they do so they should consider food banks and those who might not be able to access it. Ask local food banks and see what they need.”Bob Ashford, chair of trustees at Fair Frome, a Somerset-based charity which runs a food bank, said demand had “spiralled” over the past week, with the number of people collecting food parcels up around fourfold.“It’s unprecedented. There are queues every day. And it’s going to increase further. Most of our clients are already highly disadvantaged, and the virus is increasing their vulnerability hugely,” he told The Independent.“But the staples we normally put in food parcels, like bread and other basics, are hard to source because of the stockpiling. It’s just not on the shelves.”Many food banks have\u0026nbspalso seen a sudden drop in volunteers as many, often due to their age or pre-existing health conditions, have been unable to leave their homes due to the risk of contracting the virus.Mr Ashford encouraged the public to generate a “wider community response” by looking out for their neighbours and\u0026nbspdonating\u0026nbspto their local food bank\u0026nbspor offering to\u0026nbspvolunteer.James Quayle, who heads up the North Paddington Food Bank,\u0026nbspsaid he and his team were having to “scratch around” to obtain the supplies they needed because they were subject to purchase restrictions in\u0026nbspsupermarkets.“As it is, we haven’t been\u0026nbspable to get all the food we need for next week. Everyone knows that food banks are already stretched, so there should be alarm bells ringing that we won’t be able to respond to the need now,” he said.“More people will be going hungry. It’s worrying that things\u0026nbspare already at this\u0026nbsppoint\u0026nbspbecause we know we’re not at the worst of it yet.”The current demand rivals that seen at Christmas, said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, speaking at Saturday’s press conference, only “without the four-month build-up period”. She added that there was “plenty of food in the supply chain”.Amid the mounting concerns, many companies have established initiatives aimed at bolstering emergency food supplies, with Asda donating £5m to community charities and extending accessible hours for NHS workers, while Manchester City and Manchester United donated £100,000 to food banks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These iniduals will not have a right to live in Britain after the deadline of June 2021, unless they successfully appeal the decision.The number remains proportionately small, as there have been nearly 3 million applications processed overall, but it marks a considerable jump from the previous monthly figures, when just seven people had been refused.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt that point the refusals were all on the grounds of criminality, but most of the latest refusals were due to issues around eligibility –\u0026nbspusually because the applicant has been unable to provide the relevant\u0026nbspdocumentary\u0026nbspevidence.While the number is still proportionately low, campaigners have raised alarm at the sudden increase, and it is likely to prompt concern around difficulties more vulnerable people face when obtaining evidence.Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWithout physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe Home Office said officials had made every attempt to obtain the necessary evidence before refusing applications, and that decisions to refuse were not taken lightly and signed off at a high level.Maike Bohn, co-founder of campaign group\u0026nbspthe3million, told The Independent she was concerned by the fact that while there had been no refusals on eligibility grounds before February 2020, there was now a sharp rise.“This is hard to explain. We urgently need more explanation from the Home Office as to why those cases have been refused,” she said. “It is concerning that as soon as the UK left the EU we see people being refused settled status.”Christopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said there were likely to be more and more refusals beyond criminality grounds, which may worry a lot of people in uncommon family arrangements, which tend to be the most complex applications.\u0026nbspHe also raised alarm over the gaps in free outreach and advice services that are likely to form due to the coronavirus outbreak, which may cause problems for those receiving requests for further information from the Home Office, but not know how to respond, and called on the Home Office to pause any refusals until the emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are our families and friends, our colleagues and carers. They must have the right to stay.\u0026nbspEven before the coronavirus crisis, we were warning that tens of thousands of EU citizens will be left without settled status when the Conservative government’s arbitrary deadline hits next year.“That would leave thousands of people effectively undocumented and at risk of eviction, detention and even deportation. It will be a new Windrush scandal on an even bigger scale.”The Home Office figures show that overall, there have been more than 3.34 million applications to the scheme up to the end of February 2020.Minister for future borders and immigration Kevin Foster said: “EU citizens have made huge contributions to our country.

Our Games are not next week or two weeks from now. They’re four months from now. I think a lot may change in that time period. So we are affording the IOC the opportunity to gather that information and expert advice, and at this point in time we do not feel it’s necessary for us to insist that they make a decision.”USA Swimming is a huge draw when watching the Olympic Games given the level their athletes perform at, with former\u0026nbspswimmers including Michael Phelps, who is the most decorated Olympian of all time. So the organisation speaking out against the continuation of the Games comes as\u0026nbspa huge blow for the IOC while it weighs the difficult decision.Jacob Pebley, a swimmer on the 2016 US Olympic‘s team, released a statement about why the Games should be postponed this year.\u0026nbspTeam USA and role models for hundreds of thousands of young athletes, attend Olympic Trialsthe Olympics in good conscience?” he wrote. “To do so would fly in the face of all emerging evidence and best practices for social distancing and protecting the health of vulnerable communities.”US Gymnastics team has not publicly taken a position on if the Olympics should be postponed this year.\u0026nbspThe British Olympic Association (BOA) recently said it would not “endanger the health” of its athletes by encouraging them to train for the Games if it was not in their best interest to do so.\u0026nbsp“We can be categorically clear that we will not endanger the health and wellbeing of the athletes or wider delegation at any point,” the BOA said.\u0026nbsp“It is imperative to preserve competitive integrity for athletes, but it is clearly only wise for athletes to continue to prepare for the Games where it is safe and appropriate to do so, within relevant Government and public health guidelines.”But the organisation said it\u0026nbspstill respected the IOC and its decision-making process when ultimately deciding if the Games should be postponed or continue.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We get that.We also think the “universal income” idea is an ill-considered and permanently ruinous fix.But promises, and a temporary ban on evicting renters, won’t quell the fear.This virus is not the fault of the workers, nor the Government whose draconian restrictions are sound.But with the economy in total meltdown, only the Government now can get Britain paid.Do it today, Rishi.CLOSING schools was grimly inevitable but right. It always seemed odd to keep them open while telling everyone to stay home.The Government must fulfil its pledge to ensure kids on free school meals are fully funded to get fed.We pay tribute to the NHS staff, delivery drivers and social carers whose often low-paid work is so essential that their children WILL still be looked after in school.And our hearts go out to the teenagers whose GCSEs and A-levels will be postponed indefinitely.This is an unprecedented nightmare, blighting their childhoods.We can only help each other endure it.IMAGINE the evil of using a deadly ­pandemic to spread fake news furthering your political or commercial agenda.It should no longer shock us after the Salisbury poisonings.But Kremlin trolls are sowing panic online to undermine the West’s Covid- strategies.Let’s remember that, next time our leaders have to make nice with Putin at the G.Meanwhile, conspiracy cranks say hand sanitiser causes cancer — and charlatans claim their “yoghurt suppositories” or vitamin pills “cure” the virus.Where do they do this with near impunity  That’s right . . .On Facebook, which talks such a good game about policing its site — but is always found wanting.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is a time for unity and for respecting others, especially the most vulnerable.As the Queen put it yesterday in her admirable statement: “I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.”As the emergency deepens, abuse of privilege should play no part in our national response.But that is exactly what is now happening, as is graphically demonstrated by the saga of private Covid- tests kits.One of the biggest problems the Government faces is the shortage of capacity for testing.To prevent the current system from being overwhelmed by demand, NHS policy is only to test people with a “high chance” of having the illness, such as those who have ed from high-risk countries or are displaying symptoms.Even doctors and nurses working in the front-line are not routinely tested.But to evade such official restrictions, a growing number of the rich and famous are forking out for private coronavirus kits, which can cost anything between £ and £.According to one report this week, more than , wealthy figures in Britain have ordered such kits.Dr Mark Ali, director of the Harley Street clinic, said: “We have private iniduals – some recognisable names there – and we are testing lords and ladies and even doctors and dentists who are worried about catching the disease.”It is the same story of privileged access in the US, where, just as in Britain, shortages of supplies mean that many health care workers and sick people are unable to get diagnoses.But some stars seek to bypass rules that limit tests to those most at risk.A huge controversy erupted this week at the news that eight top NBA basketball teams has been tested, making a mockery of the rationing.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, spoke for much of the public when he said that “an entire NBA team should not get tested for Covid- while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealth, but for the sick.”On both sides of the Atlantic, this two-tiered approach is wrong on so many levels.It is a deep insult to healthcare workers. It is profoundly isive.And it does not lessen the burdens on the NHS here in Britain, as some apologists pretend.Those who test positive will still have to be treated in the health service, since the British private medical sector does not have the resources for this crisis.Selfish and irresponsible, the Covid-test queue jumpers are the equivalents of the supermarket stockpilers or the social distancing refuseniks who still insist on going down to the pub.During the Second World War, when the Blitz spirit was at its peak, there was fierce hostility to rich iniduals who tried to cheat on rationing regulations or avoid national service.The same contempt should now be shown to those who try to dodge the rules that promote fairness.But it is not just in testing where the narrow self-centredness of the rich can be found. They use their wealth to insulate themselves in other ways.Some are buying special private medical care, like intravenous infusions of vitamins and minerals to boost their immune system.Lansherhof, a private medical facility at the London Arts Club, reported this week an  per cent increase in enquires for its Immune Plus Support Infusion, which costs £.The rich are also using private jet travel to avoid the rest of the public as they conduct business or fly to remote havens.Inquiries for international flights by private jets are estimated to be up nine-fold since the outbreak began, while Hong Kong International Airport reported this week its busiest day for private jet activity.Nor do the rich have to endure the normal airport ordeal suffered by other passengers.A spokeswoman for Quintessentially, a concierge company for millionaires, said: “Members who are travelling commercially are choosing to book elite services at airports, not your typical first-class lounge.For example, private terminals where guests are greeted and given their own suite.Check-in, customs and security are all done privately and guests are taken to the doors of the aircraft.Members can request for the jetty to be cleared so they minimise the interactions with other passengers”.Most Brits have no choice over where they live in the midst of this crisis.But that is not true of the wealthy who can find sanctuary in one of their many properties or rent out an expensive rural bolt-hole.Some are now paying £,-a-month for a luxury base in the Cotswolds.Nor does self-isolation have to be the imprisoning experience that it is for ordinary citizens.The rich can bring in private chefs for their dinners, or expensive tutors for their children.The company Tutors International, which provides elite tuition services, says it has seen “a massive upswing in requests” since the outbreak began.The elite even have luxury face masks. The fashionable Airinum Urban Air Mask costs £ and claims to protect “against airborne particles as small as .mm.”But in this rarefied world, problems are faced by the elite that would never be considered by others.Wailing that she now has now chance to show off her expensive jewellery, one female financier in London says: “I’m just not sure when my next ball will be.”The experience of the affluent is in dramatic contrast to the misery faced by people at the other end of the scale.While the rich cocoon themselves, it is the wage-earners, the straitened households, the poor and the unemployed who are now in the eye of the storm.Our society is just beginning to realize the terrying consequences of this disaster, where the mounting death toll is matched by economic meltdown.Vast numbers of people – from hotel cleaners to airline cabin crew, from bar staff to retail assistants – are going to lose their jobs.The ranks of the five million self-employed will be decimated. Small businesses across the country will collapse.Food banks are already running short of supplies, while the plight of the homeless – who cannot isolate themselves on the streets – is desperate as shelters close.At worst, our prosperous civilisation could slide into a kind of modern feudal structure, with only the aristocracy at the top enjoying a decent standard of living.At a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Trump was asked whether “the well-connected go to the front of the line”.He replied philosophically: “You’d have to ask them that. Perhaps that’s been the story of le.”But it should not be that way, especially when mankind is facing one of its darkest hours.We should all be in this together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are all in this together.“If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should contact  online in the first instance or approach your GP surgery by phone or online.”We asked you to submit your most urgent questions to our experts. Here is what you wanted to know . . .Dr Cooper says: Make the most of   technology to keep in contact with family and friends. This is a good time for virtual meet-ups via the phone, FaceTime, WhatsApp, Skype and so on.Many local areas have started online forums to keep neighbours connected. You could also ‘meet’ others for chatting about specic interests, whether it is motorbikes, knitting or books.If you do not know of such a group, search for one.And why not enjoy the vanishing art of letter-writing, albeit online  And write more leisurely emails than the usual businesslike communications.Use social media, too. There are some great Facebook groups which are helpful for getting through isolation. But stay away from misinformation on Covid-.Blogs and podcasts can also be ways of keeping you in touch with the world. Then there is always TV, radio or a good book to help you feel you are not all alone. Keeping mentally active is as important as keeping physically active.Dr Cooper says: Keeping fit over a   period of social distancing or isolation is vital. If you have any outdoor space, use it to get fresh air and maybe do some gardening.Housework may help a bit, and it helps keep surfaces clean — but from a fitness point of view, doing specic exercises is even better.The Body Coach Joe Wicks has put more than  free home workouts on YouTube, with something for all fitness levels. There are other offerings too, so see what takes your fancy.If you have the space, use a skipping rope or hula hoop in your garden.As ever, do not overdo it. If you are not used to exercise, start gently, build up gradually and take heed of any pain, shortness of breath or other symptoms.This is still   being studied. It ies by country so more research is needed.Yes, some people may have the disease without displaying any symptoms.Dr Cooper says: If you have not   tested positive for Covid- or been advised to self-isolate, you can carry on, but take extra hygiene precautions when youfrom the walk.You should be social distancing regardless, so be sure you keep two metres away from people.If you self-isolate, you should restrict yourself and your dog to the house and garden,you have one.Perhaps enlist a neighbour or friend for walkies, or try local resources set up to put people in contact during this pandemic.You are likely to find someone who would be delighted to walk your pooch. You can keep up to date with advice from the RSPCA on rspca.org.uk.Dr Cooper says: There is a lot   you can do. Top of the list is not smoking and not drinking to excess. Eat a healthy menu rich in fruit, vegetables and wholegrains.If you are concerned about whether your diet is adequate, take a daily multivitamin.Exercise regularly, get enough sleep and try to address your stress.Of course, follow all the advice on washing hands often and well, and avoid touching your face with your hands, especially when they are dirty.Dr Cooper says: No, because   antibiotics are not effective against viruses. They can only work against bacteria.It is true that some viral infections can sometimes lead on to a bacterial one — for example, a chest infection can complicate flu.But the research suggests that taking antibiotics ahead of bacterial complications does not actually prevent complications from developing. Dr Cooper says: Coronavirus   seems to live for up to  hours on smooth surfaces such as plastic and steel, so it makes good sense to clean these areas thoroughly and often.It is not yet certain to what extent heat, cold or sunlight will affect this virus’s survival, but our knowledge is increasing all the time.Dr Cooper says: Because Covid- is   breathed in, it is no surprise that it affects the upper airways and sometimes the lungs.The lung complications are either pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome . If it is going to happen, ARDS sets in during the second week.With ARDS, the lungs can inflate and deflate, but they no longer do their job of transferring oxygen within the air to the bloodstream.That is why being on a ventilator is not always the answer. Instead, a treatment called ECMO , which requires specialist equipment, needs to take over while the lungs recover.Dr Cooper says: Unfortunately,   there is no evidence that vitamin C supplements help beat coronavirus. But they are highly unlikely to do any harm.Having said that, very high doses of vitamin C have occasionally been known to damage the stomach and the kidneys, so do not take more than the recommended dose.However, people in the UK are best advised to take a routine supplement of vitamin D.Vitamin D contributes to good immunity and it mainly comes from the action of sunlight on the skin.That is why so many of us in this often cloudy country have low levels.Dr Cooper says: This may not   be what most people expect, but coronavirus seems to last longest on smooth surfaces. It only persists for  hours on cardboard, and even less on fabrics.All the same, it is worth keeping fabrics clean and washing your clothes regularly. A hot machine wash should be enough.Dr Hazell says: The incubation   period for any infectious disease is the time between when you catch it and when you start to show symptoms.The incubation period for coronavirus is thought to be between one and  days, probably around five days on average.Dr Cooper says: It is impossible   to be sure without testing the whole population for Covid-, but for now the estimate is around three to four per cent.The death rate is lower for children and higher for older people or those with pre-existing health problems.Bear in mind that people with ongoing illnesses may die during the coronavirus pandemic without catching the infection at all.That is becausethe NHS is swamped, they may be unable to get the right care for their pre-existing problem.That is why the Government is doing all it can to slow the spread of the disease — and we all need to do our bit by following the latest medical and scientic advice.Dr Hazell says: Probably. Soap   and water removes more of certain types of germs than hand sanitiser. And hand sanitiser is not always used correctly — people might not use enough or might wipe it off before it has dried.But of course the best thing to use is the thing that you have at the time. Suggesting that people wash their hands regularly when out and about is completely impractical, and a hand sanitiser with at least  per cent alcohol, used properly, is certainly worth using.Dr Hazell says: Like most viral   infections, the spread is airborne sosomeone near you coughs or sneezes, they will spread droplets of the virus which you can ingest. This is why there is such strong advice about social distancing.Unlike some other viruses, the coronavirus’s long survival period on surfaces — as has been said, it’s maybe up to  hours — is another way that it can spread without you being in direct contact with an ill person.Dr Hazell says: The Government   has said that anyone with a condition that would normally mean you get a flu jab on the NHS should follow social distancing carefully.This includes a wide range of conditions, including asthma, diabetes and chronic diseases of the heart, kidneys or liver.It also includes those whose immune systems are weakened as a result of disease, such as with HIV, or medications, such as some that treat arthritis and people after transplants.Dr Hazell says: The most   common symptoms are feverand a dry cough.You might also feel very tired and achey all over your body. Some people have a sore throat and their nose may be blocked or runny.I am not sure anyone fully knows the answer to why some people get dferent symptoms to others. The elderly and those with a long-term condition, particularly one to do with the heart or lungs, are more at risk of getting severe symptoms.Our understanding of coronavirus, and why some otherwise fit and well people have become very ill, is still evolving each day.Dr Hazell says: The most   important thing is good hand hygiene. Wash your hands when you can and use hand sanitiser the rest of the time.Do not touch your face —you have the virus on your hands, that will bring it up to the membranes in your nose and mouth.Follow advice given about social distancing, especiallyyou are over , and keep an eye on the news for updates. Many people still are not doing that. They need to take heed.Dr Hazell says: The Government   has included pregnant women in the list of people who might want to consider social distancing, but it is unclear whether or not this is based on sound science or just on past experiences — like when many pregnant women became very ill with swine flu in .The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has issued a statement saying that pregnant women do not appear to become more ill than the general population when they get coronavirus.It adds that there is no evidence it causes an increased risk of miscarriage or can be passed to the unborn child via the placenta.Dr Hazell says: Government   advice is that anyone with a new cough or a fever should self-isolate for seven days. Treat it as you would a cold — use paracetamol and keep yourself well hydrated.Avoid contact with relatives as much as possible, though this can be dficult in a shared house. Unless you are becoming more unwell or think you need the hospital, there is no need to seek medical help.Dr Hazell says: The simple   answer is we do not know, but probably not. Respiratory infections are generally less common in summer months, but this is a new infection and may behave dferently.We also need to take into account that fewer people are immune to coronavirus because it is so new, so that reduces the likelihood it will disappear in summer.Dr Hazell says: Any test has a   sensitivityand a specicity . No test can be  per cent sensitive and  per cent specic — and the coronavirus tests are no dferent.At the start of the outbreak there were many anecdotes about  negative tests, where patients had several negative tests before getting a positive one.But this could be because they developed the illness after passing the earlier tests.Studies of some tests have shown that they are around - per cent sensitive, which means that for  people with a negative test, ten to  of them may actually have the virus.Public Health England and NHS England say that the current test they are using is highly sensitive.Dr Hazell says: Best not to for   now. There have been some concerns that the use of ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory drugs could make some patients with infectious diseases very ill — chickenpox is a good example.The NHS currently advises patients with symptoms of coronavirus to use paracetamol instead.Dr Hazell says: The Centers For   Disease Control And Prevention in the US has said that coronavirus has not been detected in drinking water and that the processes used to make water clean and safe would remove or inactivate the virus. Dr Hazell says: This is almost   impossible to answer because it depends on how close you get to the person and where they are in their disease development.It is unlikely that coronavirus could be proven to have a  per cent transmission rate.Dr Hazell says: You cannot   catch coronavirus from eating food. In theory, you could catch it from a packetsomeone with the virus had recently touched the surface of the packet.Dr Hazell says: A dog in   Hong Kong was found to have coronavirus, but there is no evidence to suggest our pets can transmit it.Dr Kassam says: The most   recent government advice is that any person with a high temperatureor a new, continuous cough should self-isolate for seven days.If they live with other people, all household members should stay at home for  days from the day the first person showed symptoms.Dr Kassam says: The   World   Health Organisation recommends thatyou are healthy you only need to wear a maskyou are taking care of someone with a suspected infection. I would advise my patients to check official government advice on this.The most important thing people can do at present is self-isolateshowing the signs of Covid- and practise regular and safe hand-washing.Nothing suggests that any specic diet or dietary supplements cut infection risk or theor severity.Dr Kassam says: As   yet, there is no vaccine, although vaccines are being developed and trials have recently started.Researchers are also working on anti-viral treatments but again, these are currently only in the trial stage.Dr Kassam says: Seasonal   flu   viruses and Covid- are both contagious viruses that cause respiratory illness. The symptoms are very similar in a number of ways and doctors are still learning about Covid-.Dr Kassam says: One of the   main dficulties we are facing is that people can be contagious when they have no apparent symptoms. So do not ignore appeals to socially distance.Dr Kassam says: Last week,   the first human trial of a potential vaccine was started in the US. There are many dferent companies developing vaccines but it is likely that a widely available vaccine will not be ready until later this year.Dr Kassam says: You stay at   home for seven daysyou have either a high temperature or a new, continuous cough. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for  days from the day the first person got symptoms.Dr Kassam says: There is not   enough data at present to answer this question.Dr Kassam says: The name   comes from the Latin corona, meaning “crown” or “halo”, which is how the virus looks.Dr Kassam says: If you are   looking after someone who is self-isolating, you should also self-isolate for a period of  days.Patients should follow guidance from the NHSthey are struggling to manage.Dr Kassam says: Yes, most   definitely. Regular hand-washing is one of the most important things you can do.You should wash your hands for at least  seconds and ensure they are thoroughly dry.Dr Hazell says: There is a   theoretical risk that the virus could be circulated in an air conditioning system, but droplets circulating in the air will probably only survive for a few hours in the air, compared to possibly days on surfaces.You could consider turning air conditioning off, butthis isn’t within your controlthen the key message of hand sanitising applies.Dr Boulter says: This is an   unlikely event but eating food that has been contaminatedmay be a route of transmission.Dr Boulter says: Social   distancing reduces interaction between people and therefore limits the spread of the virus.Key measures include: Avoiding contact with those who have symptoms avoiding non-essential use of public transport working from homepossible avoiding large gatherings and gatherings in small public spacesavoiding gatherings with friends and family and only contacting essential services such as GPs by phone or online.Dr Boulter says: There is   no   recommended advice regarding this. However, regular hand-washing with soap for at least  seconds is vital and always washing before preparing food is advised.Dr Boulter says: If someone   develops either a high temperatureor a new, continuous cough, they should stay at home.They should not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. They do not need to contact  to tell them they are self-isolating.Testing for corona- virus is not neededthey are staying at home. They should stay at home for  days.Other people who live in the home should stay indoors for  days from the day the first person got symptoms.If there is someone living in the home who is  or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere  for them to stay for  days.While staying at home together, try to keep away from each other.The NHS  online coronavirus service should be usedthey feel they cannot cope with their symptoms at home, their condition is getting worse or their symptoms do not get better after seven days.Dr Boulter says: It is better   to   use separate bathroomspossible. This is particularly importantthere is a medically vulnerable person in the home.If this is not possible, a shared bathroom should be cleaned each time it is used, for example by wiping all surfaces that have been touched. Do not share towels. Dr Boulter says: A dishwasher    should be usedpossible. If not, washing-up liquid, warm water and thorough drying of utensils should suffice.If there is a vulnerable person in the home, shared spaces such as kitchens or bathrooms should not be used at the same time.Windows should be opened in shared spacespossible.  Dr Hazell says: No. The   key   distinction between self-isolation and social distancing is thatyou are self-isolating you don’t leave the house at any point to go out. You can use the garden.Dr Boulter says: People may   be infectious from an early stage in the disease and before symptoms show. This is why social distancing is so important.Dr Boulter says: To date this   has not been determined, hence why we should all be using social distancing, disposable tissues and hand-washing to limit the spread. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.It comes as an army of , retired nurses and doctors have been told “Your NHS Needs You” in the battle against coronavirus.Medical students and trainee nurses were also invited to join the fight — while members of the public have been askedthey can help, too.The Prime Minister said he expects the tide to be turned in the fight within  weeks, as he urged the public to follow social distancing advice and for businesses to stand by your employees.But he implied that this is onlythe public heeds the social distancing guidance, saying: I know its tough, I know its dficult... but please, please follow the advice.Meanwhile, the Queen issued a message to the nation which said the UK is entering a period of great concern and uncertainty, adding that our nations history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one.Public Health Englandsays that people with coronavirus symptoms – dry cough, fever, and a general feeling of listlessness – should avoid seeing older relatives to avoid passing it on.Ahead of new guidelines being published next week, the advice is the same as for the rest of the population.A great way to keep stocks of food and supplies is to mobilise elderly people with internet shopping.Butthey do not have access to the internet or are not handy with a computer, Age UK recommend that healthy, more active people help with running errands like picking up bits of shopping.The Government is in talks with major retailers to ensure the elderly and vulnerable can still get access to supplies, such as through a telephone hotline where they can place orders.Anyone showing symptoms, whether they are confirmed to have coronavirus or not, is advised to stay away from visiting their local GP surgery.People suspected of being infected should check the NHS coronavirus webpage - and should only call they are directed to do so by the website, to avoid jamming the phone lines.Part of the mental battle of isolation is remaining as active as possible - eventhis means standing up  times in one hour and walking between rooms in the house.If the elderly person you are helping has a garden, encourage them to walk around it - and make sure they are not immobile for long periods of time, watching television for long periods or remaining bed bound.Ensure carers in homes or those doing regular home visits do not attendthey are sick or displaying symptoms of coronavirus.A number of pharmacies around the UK are making plans to deliver medication to elderly people in the event of self isolation.However, older people are increasingly getting online – data from the Office for National Statistics show that  per cent of people aged  to  had used the internet in , up from  per cent in .It may be worth ensuring that the older people in your le are set up with online shopping accounts now, are able to access social media to stay in touch with other or have been introduced to streaming services such as Netflix.A glimmer of good news came from Mr Johnson earlier in the week, who said British experts expect to start trials for a vaccine against the virus within a month, although expectations are that a vaccine will take at least a year.He also said a game-changer antibody test was coming down the track which could identy whether somebody somebody had become immune to the disease so they couldto their daily le.The PM also pledged to massively increase testing to up to , a day, which combined with collective action and scientic progress he said would save many, many thousands of lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It began with La Marseillaise and a sweeping view of the French parliament. Then Macron gazed at the camera with such authority, and Frenchness, I expected him to carry on: “As this is France, I expect some of you will want to riot. “This is fine, but I must ask all rioters to stand six feet apart from each other. “Before you throw a petrol bomb, you must use a small splash of petrol to clean your ’ands, as the bomb could carry the virus. Now I will read a short poem I have written, about how,you ‘ave the symptoms, you may need a ­ventilator, but most important you must feel the tingle of love and passion, running through the trees of your heart.”  Instead he ran through a series of measures to assure everyone their homes and jobs would be protected from the lockdown. Rent and utility bills were suspended, and a state fund was set up to ensure no company would go bust. Unemployment pay would be increased, and no one could be dismissed from their job. Similar rules were brought in across Europe. But in Britain we were “advised” not to travel or go to work, leaving half the country terried of losing jobs and homes, so they carried on as normal.  To be fair, this must have been impossible to see in advance. Who could have knownyou ask people to stay in, even though this might mean they’ll lose their job and their house and have nothing to eat, they might ignore you  Maybe other countries had carried out experiments in secret labs.They told  people to make a cup of tea. But  of them were told once they’d made the tea, they’d be laid off from work, andthe bank would demand their ­mortgage, and their gas would be cut off.Astonishingly, those people were less inclined to even put the kettle on.  For example, I heard an -year-old man call a radio phone-in, to say: “I work at a market stall, but I can’t stay off work, I have to pay my rent.” Then he said: “Anyway I’m fine, there’s nothing wrong with me at all.” This suggests he’s not quite worked out how diseases work. Generally, you are absolutely fine, right up until the moment you get the disease. If this disease went round thinking, “There’s no point in attacking this person, as they’re fine”, it would be much less of a problem.

Restaurants, bars, banqueting suites and offices went dark even before the lockdown as MPs packed bags and files for isolation in their constituencies. It is, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a sparsely attended and carefully well-spaced Commons, “unprecedented in peacetime”. Not a war. But very much at war against the coronavirus enemy, with everybody on the frontline and the Army poised for action, like cavalry over the hill. As in wartime, political hostilities have been suspended. Labour is ­attempting to present a united front. It’s proven dficult, given the Government’s slow reaction, confusing messages and Boris’s pretence at being in control when he so evidently wasn’t. “We’ll do whatever it takes” became a daily moveable feast. Then came the most gargantuan state intervention in the economy and the way we live in the history of the UK. The recent Budget – lauded as the blueprint for a new politics under Boris – has been consigned to a very short chapter in the history books. In its place came a form of collectivism that goes beyond what even the old Soviet Russia dared attempt. Spending and borrowing way beyond that promised by Labour at the last election. Not because Boris and his “nerves of steel” Chancellor Rishi Sunak wanted to, but because they had no choice. At a time when trust in the Government is paramount, all the confusion had to stop and they had to act – in the most ­dramatic way since the wartime s. Until then, Britain had been lagging behind every other affected nation bar the US. Now we are all in this ­together Downing Street’s strategy has finally turned from the promotion of inidualism to the collective needs of all. Labour leaders are anxious not to “play politics” during such a dire crisis. The reckoning has been suspended until another day. Boris’s managerial competence – never his strong point – is being tested.  The lockdown and economic bail-out must, we hope, see us through the crisis. As the Chancellor himself says, it will be over one day. Then judgement will come. The country will be on the long, long climb out of economic carnage and the ­avoidance of either recession or depression. Fundamental questions will be asked about the political and economic ­principles underpinning the governing regime. A government that caused more deaths from the virus by waiting too long to act will pay a political price. Boris is fond of comparisons with Winston Churchill, but while his hero won the war, he lost the next election.

One of these people is Michael, of course. Some daily meetings inside No are now taking place via conference call - and it is understood the Cabinet will meet remotely on Tuesday.

During a live TV address from Paris, Mr Philippe expressed extreme frustration that Britain was lagging behind in the ‘war’ against the deadly illness. ‘Everyone within the European Union must adopt coherent methods and processes to fight the epidemic, as in Italy, France and Spain’, said Mr Philippe. ‘It goes without saying thatneighbouring states such as the United Kingdom spend too long continuing to avoid these containment measures, then we would have dficulty accepting British nationals who would move freely in their own country and then come to our country,’ the Prime Minister had added.

Social distancing  It comes amid the closure of West Wittering Beach, in Sussex, after aposthousandsapos of people descended on the site. According to the BBC, a member of the management team in West Wittering said: The crowds were into the thousands - dispersed on to the large beach - but itaposs the method of getting here... weaposre at the end of a peninsular, thereaposs one way in and one way out. Resorts in other places, including East Yorkshire and Brighton, were also reportedly busy today today. A number of holiday parks and cottages in Cornwall and Devon have been blasted by members of the public after refusing to close their doors despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The likes of Parkdean Resorts and Sykes Cottages have come under fire for remaining open despite Government advice against all but essential travel, Cornwall Live reports. Parkdean has taken the decision to close on-park facilities or issue a voucher for anyone with a holiday booked until April  - but that is not enough in the eyes of many. Popular Welsh tourist sites like Pen y Fan, Snowdon, Barry Island, Porthcawl and Cardfaposs Roath Park were also drawing in the crowds. Hundreds of cars lined the roads around Snowdon and Pen y Fan as people sought to get fresh air and exercises but stayed away from city centres. At Snowdon, hundreds of cars were parked in car parks and along roads, as numerous walkers hiked up Walesapos biggest mountain. But they were warned they were putting themselves and mountain rescuers at risk as the covid- outbreak escalates, Wales Online reports. Expressing his shock at the scene on Facebook, one man said: I’m one for going round Snowdonia a lot. And I mean a lot... but I have never, ever seen cars parked along the Pass like this. He added: Absolutely shocked me, this has.

Nearly , staff will also help the NHS deliver other urgent operations and cancer treatments. The deal includes , hospital beds across England, nearly , more ventilators, more than , nurses, over  doctors and , other clinical staff. In London the deal includes more than , hospital beds and in excess of  operating theatres and critical beds. The services will be delivered at cost – with no profit being made. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens hailed the deal by saying: “We’re dealing with an unprecedented global health threat and are taking immediate action to gear up.” The number of intensive care beds made available under the deal is believed to be in the hundreds. But it is understood new capacity will be created by converting large spaces in private hospitals into makesht intensive care units with more beds. Meanwhile new guidelines published by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence say sufferers’ chance of recovery should be assessed when doctors decide whether to admit them. In its guidance on clinical decision-making published yesterday, Nice advises medics: “Base decisions on admission of adults to critical care on the likelihood of their recovery, taking into account the likelihood that a person will recover from their critical care admission to an outcome that is acceptable to them.” The move comes as intensive care beds in London have nearly been exhausted as the capital bears the brunt of the fight. At present, hundreds of seriously ill coronavirus patients are being treated in ICUs, which are running at nearly their , capacity. Sources say the extra capacity will also be filled within weeks. One source said bleakly: “After that, it’s Armageddon.” On Friday Northwick Park, in Harrow, North West London, declared a critical incident after a surge of Covid-patients. Almost  with the virus were being treated across South London.At one hospital all but two of the  patients being treated in its intensive care unit are victims of the infection – with one as young as . Meanwhile, specialist machines that keep the most seriously ill patients alive are also running at near-capacity. Just  beds in England are set up for ECMO equipment, which support the heart and lungs – compared to , in Japan. An NHS worker said: “These machines are the dference between le and death and we don’t have enough.” Sources say the Government missed an opportunity to order more before demand outstripped supply. World Health Organization expert Dr Bruce Aylward highlighted that China had been able to save patients on the machines.  He said: “China find cases fast, get them isolated, in treatment and supported early. “Secondly they ventilate dozens in the average hospital – they use ECMO when ventilation doesn’t work. This is sophisticated health care. They have a survival rate for this disease I would not extrapolate to the rest of the world.” Meanwhile, some GP surgeries have not yet received enough protective clothing for treating patients with Covid-, and are restricting services to telephone triage until they do. Nurses have reported having to wear binbags to protect themselves while treating suspected cases. Some will be forced to self-isolate between shts.GPs and hospital staff are turning to eBay and Groupon to buy supplies – and some hospitals have told doctors not to “double glove” to preserve supplies. One trauma doctor said: “I’ve worked in conflicts that have been better prepared.” It comes as the NHS has been hit by a delay in deliveries and a surging global demand. One worried West Midlands GP said: “Our stock is running low.” GPs are also being advised to order in body bags to deal with the crisis. The grim item was added to a list of personal protection equipment being offered to surgeries by the Government.

They all allow users to have conversations with multiple people at once, so it’s possible to have a drink together even while practising social distancing or self-isolation. One of those embracing the new phenomenon is communications professional John Slinger.In a post on Twitter, he said: “Great virtual pint with some pals tonight. I’d prefer to be in a pub.“But I take social distancing seriously and think that in about two weeks time a lot of people will be asking why we didn’t move quicker ..” It’s not just alcoholic drinks which are being shared online. Some, like Professor Kate Jones, an ecology and biology expert at University College London, have been using technology to have virtual coffees too. “Virtual coffee mornings with friends are an essential mental health and safety measure - although owing to time zones - some of us were drinking whisky mornings with friends,” she posted. Irish journalist Conor Wilson, meanwhile, says he even attended a stag party via WhatsApp.  In a post on Twitter, he said: “Was supposed to be on a stag party in Kilkenny this weekend. It should go without saying that it’s been cancelled.  “It’s now a virtual stag party - lads drinking each other’s health from home in the WhatsApp group.” Others have been organising events like online pub quizzes and birthdays in an effort to keep spirits high during the weeks of lockdown ahead. In a press conference on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told pubs, clubs, cafes and restaurants throughout the UK to shut as soon as they reasonably can”.

Claire, , and groom Matt Zinser, , were determined to keep calm and carry on down the aisle just hours before the country was ordered into lockdown. The couple’s impromptu nuptials are a ray of sunshine in these frightening and uncertain times. They feared their dream wedding would be cancelled because of social distancing measures. So, with council permission, they ­arranged an impromptu do at St Pancras railway station in central London. Claire, a teacher, got her lessons covered and Matt took the afternoon off from his hospitality job to race to the ceremony, which was originally booked for April . They had already cut down their plans for the big day because Frenchman Matt’s family wouldn’t be able to attend due to the ­restrictions across the Channel. They settled on a location of Searcys restaurant and champagne bar at the station. They chose the location because St Pancras is where Eurostar trains from France arrive in London. Claire, of Muswell Hill, north London, said: “On Tuesday I rang the council, who were amazing, and Searcys, who were also amazing, and within two hours the wedding was organised for the next day at pm. “Neither of us was fussed about ­having a large wedding – it was just important to us that we got married.  “We’ll have a blessing and a shindig after all this has blown over.” The couple’s optimistic approach amid the global health crisis is typical of Brits across the nation determined make the best of the shutdown. Personal trainer Sarah Burford ­yesterday beat the ban on gyms by ­holding an outdoor session for  people in her cul-de-sac in Gloucester. Sarah, who plans to offer the free classes every Saturday, said: “We’re all facing something we’ve never experienced and we need to make sure we stay fit.”  In South Yorkshire, ­residents of rural village Pilley have banded together to help those in need. They posted leaflets to all homes offering to provide supplies.A Facebook page has been set up too, ­encouraging those who are left isolated or lonely to chat to others on there.Adele Bailey, who helped to start the group, said: “The country needs to work together. “It is people themselves who will crack on and do things.”  There are stories of similar ­community spirit from all over the country – around  in total, ­offering services from shopping and dog ­walking to companionship. Residents of Bishopston, Bristol, took part in street singing to keep their spirits up while social-distancing. Pub landlord Chris Williams, , and his dad Peter, , demonstrated how they could deliver beer to self-isolated pensioners with a fishing rod. Chris, a keen angler who runs the Holly Bush Inn in Makeney, Derbys, said: “You can attach our four and two-pint delivery kegs to a line.  “If there are any keen anglers who are self-isolated they can reel in ­supplies just like a catch of the day.” Breweries are also stepping up door-to-door deliveries in a bid to rescue the industry after pubs were ordered to close. The Government has relaxed licensing rules allowing businesses to sell and deliver direct to drinkers without the need for an off-sales licence. Singer Steve Linn, of Bournemouth, Dorset, has been serenading ­elderly people in care homes from the ­garden as they sit ­behind the windows. Even in under-pressure hospitals, hero nurses found a way to lt spirits.Sandra Roberts and her colleague Lyn Roberts went viral after they posted a video of their theatre team at Basildon Hospital, Essex, boogying to the song Dance With Me Tonight by Olly Murs. Olly, , has pledged to give the team free tickets to his next gig. Dementia patients Sally and Ken – both in their eighties and isolating in Penzance, Cornwall – became an internet sensation with a video of Sally playing piano while Ken danced.

Areemaaposs sister Kazeema said: My sister who is an amazing nurse on the front line and who always helps so many has now caught this virus. She is critically ill in ICU, on a ventilator and fighting for her le. I want everyone to know how dangerous this is. My sister is only  and is normally fit and healthy. She praised hospital staff, saying they have been aposnothing but supportive and amazingapos in their care for her sister.  Kazeema continued: People are not taking this seriously enough. She is young - it is not just the elderly who are at risk. Areema first became unwell around ten days ago, first suffering with aposbody achesapos, a high temperature which could not be brought down and a cough. Her temperature would not go down and her cough was so bad it affected her lungs.  Eventually she got taken to hospital and they tested her two days ago. It came back positive and now she is in the Intensive Care Unit at the Manor Hospital. Weaposre obviously not allowed to visit her but the hospital staff are keeping in touch and updating us as often as possible. Areema loves the NHS. Her colleagues are like a second family and they have been truly amazing with her - and us. They are keeping us all strong and doing everything they can for her.

Those numbers are expected to increase signicantly in the coming days and weeks. The National Trust will close parks from midnight to prevent crowding and stop the spread of the deadly bug which has rocked Europe and the world.Cumbria Constabulary did their best to warn people away from the Lake District. The force issued a statement pleading with the public not to travel. Assistant Chief Constable Andrew Slattery, the Chair of the Cumbria Local Resilience Forum, said: Whilst we are looking at all measures to limit the spread of the COVID- coronavirus, I must urge people living outside the county not to visit. A national emergency shut-down of businesses and schools is not an excuse for a holiday. Cumbria County Council yesterday urged people to stay at home as far as possible to protect out NHS and save lives. I reiterate that advice and it is important that we all follow it. That statement apparently fell on deaf ears in Cumbria and in Wales. NWMRA wrote on Facebook: From Moel Famau in the east, through all the popular mountains in Snowdonia, people seem to have been out in force. Both the Llanberis and Ogwen teams have dealt with incidents, at least two of which have involved inexperienced people getting lost or stuck. A sign on a park bench in Snowdonia simply read aposSnowdonia is closed! F*** off home!apos.  Local politicians have raised concerns about people with second homes choosing to self-isolate in north Wales placing tremendous stress on the local NHS services. Rhun ap Iorwerth warned: “Over the past week, I’ve raised multiple times with Welsh Government, including in the Assembly Chamber, fears that our health services are coming under unnecessary increased pressure due to an influx of visitors. “Today I have had a GP contact me saying a dozen people have tried to register with his surgery as new patients whilst they’re here to isolate. He reports a major influx to his local community and that’s just second homes. Also Anglesey Council’s Tourism and Economic portfolio holder, Cllr Carwyn Jones, added: “Visitors should respectfully stay away from Anglesey for the time being.We need to slow down the spread of the virus and do everything we can to protect lives and our NHS. Now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel Anglesey is such a beautul place and we always value and welcome visitors to our island with open arms, but we are all fighting a deadly disease, lives are at risk and we all need to play our part, the sooner we defeat this the sooner we can all rebuild and get back to normal.” The government has asked all Brits to limit travel to what is absolutely necessary. On Friday Plaid Cymruaposs Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts write to the UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, call for a “no-travel directive” in respect of holiday homes and caravan parks in rural Wales until the coronavirus pandemic has abated. n her letter, she noted: “There are warnings being issued across the UK by doctors in rural areas who say that there are dangers of low hospital capacitypeople travel to isolate.

Before the announcement, some of the UK nationals said they felt let down by the Governmentaposs efforts to help themhome. Marcus Edgar, , who is working in Huanchaco in the north of the country, said  UK and Irish citizens had so-far registered on a database to say they were still stranded.  The PR consultant, from Reading, said: The UK Government has done nothing so far and that is the frustration. There are no repatriation flights, and the only wayis to register your interest in charter planes, and that is ridiculous because they cost £,. Mr Edgar, who is due tohome on April , said a Whatsapp group and database had been created by British nationals in the country, with the details for each person passed to the UK embassy in the city of Lima. I think the general feeling from most people is that they feel let down by the lack of communication from the Government, he said.On Saturday that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab had secured permission for a UK-organised flight to leave Peru for early next week following a call with his Peruvian counterpart. In a Twitter post, Mr Raab said: I had a good conversation this afternoon with my opposite number in Peru, Gustavo Meza-Cuadra.Amidst all the challenges of tackling Coronavirus, we committed to working together in the coming days to enable UK nationals in Peru and Peruvian nationals in the UK tohome.  The FCO said it would continue to work with the Peruvian government to arrange further flights in coming days. We are working round the clock to make flights available next week for British people who wish to leave Peru but who are currently unable to do so on commercial flights because of the travel restrictions that have been imposed, an FCO spokesperson said. Peru is currently on lockdown, with borders closed and no flights allowed to enter or leave the country without government permission. A curfew is running between pm and am and all shops are closed except for pharmacies and those selling food.  British nationals had been advised by the Foreign Office to find secure accommodation for the -day State of Emergency period. Caia Daly, , from north London, whose nine-month-old baby is recovering from pneumonia, is among those stranded. Ms Daly, who is originally from Dublin, Ireland, flew to Lima with her husband Carlos Abisrror and two young children in February for a four-week holiday and to see family. But their Air France flight home, which was scheduled for Friday night, was cancelled, and now they do not know how or when they will get back to the UK. To make matters worse, Ms Daly spent three days in hospital this week after her baby picked up a virus which led to pneumonia.

The nurse said many colleagues have to self-isolate after falling ill or when a family member displays symptoms, which puts even more pressure on other workers during an already dficult period. Britons who feel ill have been asked not to contact NHS  unless their condition deteriorates - which can leave space for more urgent cases to be reported. Professor Whitty, Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer, said: It is no longer necessary for us to identy every case and we will move from having testing mainly done in homes and outpatients and walk-in centres, to a situation where people who are remaining at home do not need testing. We will pivot all the testing capacity to identy those in hospitals who have symptoms so we can pick them up early, make sure we treat them well and ensure they donapost pass on the virus to other people in hospitals. So there will be a change in hospital and other testing systems. The healthcare worker, who began working for NHS  three years ago, said there were  clinicians on a sht in every centre - but that has now more than halved, meaning the waiting time of those expecting a call back hit  hours this week.Writing for Mail Online, the nurse said: The  system is not designed to cope with an emergency such as this. It was only meant to be for non-emergencies.The clinician said when someone calls because they are not surethey should see a GP, they go through a trained call-handler who asks questions using a computer programme that determines how serious their case is. They added: Often, they simply need reassurance or basic advice. Buttheir condition does seem serious, orthe call-handler isn’t sure what help to give, they will be passed to a clinician – a paramedic or a nurse like me – who can give clinical advice.  People with a cough or a high temperature have been warned not to visit GP clinics - so many who would normally go to their GP are now calling . The nurse said: Now our workload has more than doubled, I’d be lyingI didn’t admit rushing calls.  Since now anyone who has a fever or a cough must be taken to hospital in an ambulance with the crew in full protective clothing - then both the equipment and the ambulance have to be deep cleaned for an hour - there is a terrible shortage of ambulances and much longer response times. The clinician explained: An ambulance for le-threatening conditions such as stroke should normally arrive in  minutes, but at the weekend it was three and a half hours.

Several people criticised the pub on social media for staying open even though health officials advised all public venues to close to prevent further spread of the virus. DCC Malcolm Graham told the Daily Record that officers, at this time, cannot enforce the closure of any premises. He said: We are fully behind the request from the UK and Scottish Governments for entertainment venues to close, and the Chief Constable has already thanked the vast majority of people in Scotland for complying with the instruction. We expect that business owners will also wish to support the national efforts to tackle this grave threat. There are no powers conferred by the government request at this time, and therefore we have instructed officers that they should not anticipate enforcing the closure of any premises. He continued: As part of our duty to improve the safety and wellbeing of people across Scotland our officers patrolling in towns and cities can offer advice on the government request. We are aware of the proposed legislation in relation to coronavirus, and are carefully considering the implications in this very fast moving situation. It comes as the Scottish Government requested that public venues such as pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes closed as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the UK and globally. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned venues refusing to shut their doors that emergency legislation will be available within days to force them to close, The Scottish Sun reports.  She said on Twitter : “We all not hesitate to use themnecessary. “But pubs etc shouldn’t wait for that — they should do the right thing now.

Heartbreakingly, it was while she was trying to get the help she needed to slim down that she was given the devastating news she had polycystic oy syndrome and would never be able to have children. Christine had always wanted to be a mum - but determined to make the most of her le she threw herself into her job of helping children with special needs. One of her friends then inspired her to shed a massive four stone - and it helped her achieve her aposmiracleapos and become a mum. In  Christine took a pregnancy test and was overwhelmed when it showed she was expecting. She is now the proud mum to two-year-old Tabatha. The -year-old explained: I was always chunky as a child, and remember aged eight asking my mum to take me to the doctor so I could get a diet.When I went I was told the usual thing – ‘eat lots of healthy food and you’ll be fine’, but that didn’t give me the answer I was looking for.I remember wearing size  clothes when I was in year , and at ’” that basically meant I felt spherical compared to my friends. By the time she was a teenager Christine was bingeing on secret hoards of food like crisps, biscuits and chocolate. She would also double dip meals by going to her grandmotheraposs for tea and then coming home for her evening meal without telling her parents.  When she left school and started work at a printing company, Christine also started drinking. She said: I added big boozy sessions to my terrible diet, regularly downing  vodka and cokes in a night, as well as getting greasy takeaways before bed and fried breakfasts the next morning to help me cope with the hangovers. It was then that she started struggling with depression and anxiety, all because of her body image. Her GP prescribed anti-depressants but Christine was still struggling. She said: I’d suffer panic attacks at the thought of being in public spaces, so when friends would call to ask where I was, I’d iniably say I couldn’t make it, or I just wouldn’t answer my phone. When she was  Christine started an animation course at university and was determined to lose weight. He gave her some dietary advice and transferred her for a scan, where her polycystic oy syndrome was discovered, which was the reason she was struggling to lose weight. Christine said: He then explained that because of my PCOS I wouldnapost be able to have kids unless I had took tablets to regulate my menstrual cycle and then had IVF, which really wasn’t something I wanted to consider so young.EvenI had the medication – which had bad side effects – my chances of conceiving were ‘minimal’.AndI delayed the treatment there’d be even less chance of having kids, they said. It was just a ridiculous conversation, and I felt like my world was in pieces. I remember standing in the rain at the bus stop outside the GP surgery calling my mum with the news, tears rolling down my face.My right to be a woman was gone, and my depression spirally down and down. After she finished university Christine moved back in with her parents and was given the devastating news that her parents had terminal cancer. She said: I had a complete breakdown, and pretty much stopped eating completely, going down to st, but I still wouldn’t leave the house. The turning point for Christine came when she got a job at a special needs school, which she loved. She said: If I couldn’t be a mum, I could help these lovely kids find happiness, I thought.The sense of fulfilment and the other staff made me happy for the first time in living memory. Then Christine bumped into a friend from school who had lost weight with WW, which used to be Weight Watchers. Weight loss classes had never been something Christine had considered because of her anxiety but her pal reassured herwas relaxed and friendly, so she decided to give it a go.  She said: It was like she said – really open, honest and a safe place for me to talk about my feelings about food.I didn’t buy any special foods, I just used a calculator and ‘pointed’ everything, and it worked! I lost lbs in my first week and left my weigh-in skipping. In less than a year Christine had shed four stone and felt incredible inside and out. She said: I started having regular periods and came off anti-depressants for the first time in seven years.I even started exercising for the first time ever, and loved it.My panic attacks stopped completely and I was a social butterfly, always accepting invitations to head out to meet friends.I was dating and basically living the le I never thought I’d have.  Then, in September , Christine felt something wasnapost right. She had been able to stop taking the medication she had previously needed to help her PCOS, which had given her migraines. Before she visited her GP she did a pregnancy test to rule it out and was stunned when it was positive. Christine said: I called my mum straight away with the amazing news, and she was sobbing with joy.I’d spent years working with kids who came from tough, often loveless homes, wondering why I couldn’t be a mum, and now this was it, my ‘miracle’ had happened.

The Duchess, , opened up about mum guilt in the Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast and said she felt lonely after George was born in . Giovanna said: “Kate was my dream guest for so long, so having her on the podcast was amazing. “I found a lot of common ground with her. Motherhood is a complete leveller. I did have a moment half way through where I was like, ‘Oh my God, it’s the Duchess of Cambridge.’ “But for the most part, I found her warm and open. I felt like I was ­chatting to a fellow mum. I found what she was saying quite amazing, and the fact she was opening up. “She’s just like other mums. She’s self-deprecating, like all of us. She’s warm, she’s really interested in other people. Which is why I think people ­really like her. It was one hell of an experience, absolutely amazing.

I think it’s just a cough, but who knows. It’s such a scary time. “Tom was supposed to be on tour in Brazil for Mother’s Day. “The main focus of the day was to have all the mums here, mine, Tom’s and his nan, my sister’s mother-in-law. “This year it will be a bit dferent, it will just be us five, myself, Tom and our three boys. “We’re lucky we’re a family and we’re in the same house. I do realise how ­dficult it must be for some people who can’t get to their mums this Sunday. “Being a mum during this pandemic is really worrying, even though we’re told cases in children are mild and it doesn’t really affect them.” During her podcast chat with Kate, parenting guru Giovanna askedshe suffered from mum guilt.  The Duchess replied: “Yep, all the time, yep. It’s a constant challenge. You hear it time and time again from mums. “Even mums who aren’t necessarily working and aren’t having to juggle work le and family le.

Laura Pearson, from Cardf, says the flu-like virus left her “happy and alert” son Gruff, who is six months old, inconsolable and crying with pain as he battled a C fever. Speaking to Wales Online, the -year-old says her husband was the first in the family to fall ill with the highly contagious Covid-.“My other half started developing symptoms first, in the early hours on Wednesday morning - high temperature, chills, aches and a mild cough,” Laura, who lives in Pontcanna, said. “It was nothing too bad though, so we managed it the best we could by isolating him in the spare bedroom as best as possible - although, with a baby to look after, thataposs easier said than done.” But worryingly, the next day, little Gruff also began to show coronavirus symptoms.“He developed an on-and-off dry cough, but then began feeling very hot,” Laura, a freelance communications consultant, continued.

The head of the Nursing and Midwery Council has written to more than , who have retired or quit the profession telling them: “Your country needs you.” They have been urged to join an emergency register of ex-staffers willing to help ease the growing pressure on the NHS. In the first  hours after the historic NMC letter went out, a total of , had submitted applications. And today nursing chief Andrea Sutclfe asks Sunday Mirror readers who have left nursing in the last three years to rally alongside their former colleagues. The NMC’s appeal comes against an alarming backdrop of more than , unfilled nursing vacancies across the NHS. With an alarming  per cent of the workforce missing, the health service was already facing dficulties before Covid- struck. Last November, the independent Health Foundation charity warned the number of lost nurses could hit , by the end of the decade without drastic action. The charity – which crusades to improve healthcare services – claimed less qualied staff were being drafted in to plug gaps while Brexit had triggered a drop in EU nurses. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says medics who join the emergency register could come back “straight away”their registration had only recently lapsed. Others will be given refresher training “over the next couple of weeks”.  No ex-professionals in “at risk” groups, including the over s or those with underlying health issues, are being asked to re-register. Nurses who have ed to the front line told yesterday why they wanted to help fight coronavirus, despite the risks. Former intensive care staffer Christie Watson, , is set toon a temporary basis as early as next week after a refresher course. She left the register  months ago to pursue a writing career but this week decided to lend her expertise to London’s Guy’s and St Thomas where staff are working round the clock to tackle Covid-. Mum-of-two Christie said: “My background is in critical care, resuscitating and with ventilators – all the skills that are in demand with the pandemic. “I used to think nursing was something you learned rather than something you’re born to – but these times are challenging that. “This feels right and everybody who canshould do so.”  Christie’s -year nursing career began at  at Luton and Bedford Hospital and she went on to work in paediatrics at St Ormond Street and St Mary’s Hospitals in London. She said: “There are risks involved, and these are conversations I had with my family who understood completely why I wanted to do this. Having any sort of  in nursing or health feels like a responsibility in times like this. “It’s a privilege to stand once more beside nurses, helping wherever and however I can.” Another former nurse, Elaine Maxwell, told how she was inspired toto nursing by the tireless work of younger NHS medics tackling the pandemic.  Elaine, , left the profession after a -year career last year to go into the research sector, but is putting a new job on hold to help. She said: “My son and daughter-in-law are NHS nurses. The thought of what they are doing when both have been qualied less than two years made me think, why am I letting them take all the burden for this  The work they are putting in is incredible. I know I could help.  “When I thought about the sheer volume of front line NHS staff that will be needed, I realised what we have now wouldn’t be enough. Staff are exhausted and we haven’t even hit the peak.” Elaine, of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, will work at Oxford’s John Radclfe Hospital doing “as many shts as possible”. She added: “I had to think long and hard as everybody over  is at risk, but I have no long-term conditions and I’ve never been seriously ill.  I’ll be there to relieve staff so they can do the more important work. We will all be pulling together.” The NHS is under intense pressure and could quickly be overwhelmed by the rapidly rising number of patients. One forecast published this week showed up to , could die in a “worst case scenario”nothing was done to stem the virus. Scientists at Imperial College London said coronavirus was the most serious public health threat seen since the  flu pandemic - known as the Spanish flu. They predict that unless extreme measures are taken to break the virus’ progression, up to , could die as NHS intensive care was overwhelmed. This advice triggered the Government’s latest steps which saw pubs, restaurants and cafes told to close on Friday. Tory-led cuts since  has left the NHS crippled with more than , nurses quitting in the last  years.  Andrea Sutclfe CBE, Chief Executive and Registrar at the Nursing and Midwery Council At a time when the health and care system across the UK is facing its toughest challenge in fighting the Covid- pandemic, the need for our most trusted professions has never been greater. Readers of the Sunday Mirror who have worked as dedicated, skilled and expert registered nurses and midwives have made a dference to thousands of peopleaposs lives. Those still in the profession are making a dference to thousands more in these dark times. Thank you.But Covid- isn’t going away soon. We only have to look at the heart of the outbreak in Italy and other countries to see how the pressure in hospitals is so huge that le-saving care is being limited to those most likely to survive. It’s already putting tremendous pressure on our own health and care services with the science telling us the worst is yet to come. This startling news shows why the NMC has been working with the Chief Nurses, Royal Colleges and Unions to play our part in ensuring as many former nurses and midwives can help. To make sure as many people as possible can help to provide care in hospitals, in community services and in nursing homes, we’re in the process of setting up a temporary emergency register.

A source told the Sun on Sunday: “The worker tested positive before the Queen left for Windsor. But the Palace has  members of staff so, like any workplace, it’s not inconceivable it would be affected in some stage.” A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: “We wouldn’t comment on inidual members of staff. “In line with the appropriate guidance and our own processes, we have taken the necessary actions to protect all employees and people involved.”  After leaving Buckingham Palace on Thursday with her two dorgis in tow, the Queen is now at Windsor Castle with the Duke of Edinburgh.

Fiona Hornby weighed st lbs last March, however, just one year later she is down to st lbs. She says one of her biggest motivations was being able to play with her son, who is almost two-years-old.However, she was also spurred on by her ex-partner and people who mocked a picture of her online, the Manchester Evening News reports.However, it was the thought of not being able to play with her son that was her biggest concern. “He’s nearly two now,” she said. “He’s starting to run around and I was thinking I just wouldn’t have the energy to keep up with himI stayed that size.” While her son was a very important factor in kick starting her incredible weight loss, there were other issues at play as well. At the time, Fiona only took photographs of her face and tried her best to not take photos that showed her body.  When one photograph taken by someone  was shared online, the comments became very nasty and personal. Fiona, of Kearsley, near Manchester, remembered: “One of them said, ‘you could make her a new dress out of a row of tents’ and that really stuck with me. “My ex-partner who I was with at the time used to always bring my weight into arguments as well.  “When we split, I thought ‘I’ll show you!’ “But to be honest, I just wanted to prove to myself and everyone  that I could do it.” Almost  months on from when she started, Fiona weighs st lbs. In that time, she says she can count on one hand the amount of time she has exercised and puts the weight loss down to a combination of dferent diets.  Fiona added: “I’ve probably exercised about four times since I started. I’ve done no proper workouts or been to the gym or anything like that. “When I started, I was on Reddit and found out about intermittent fasting, where you fast for most of the day and get a short eating window so I tried that. “I then found out about a plan called OMAD where you eat one large meal a day so I thought that would be a good thing to combine with the fasting.  “There’s so many apps to help keep track though so that really helps.” By the end of this year, Fiona wants to weigh st lbs - a loss of exactly st from when she started. Despite losing such a large amount of weight in the last year, she admits it hasn’t always come without its dficulties.  “At the start it was just dropping off so fast,” she said. “It’s really slowed down recently and I’ll hit a plateau for a few weeks but I’ve just kept going. I think I will need to incorporate more exercise now though.” “It is quite dficult to fast andI’ve been on a night out I do cave sometimes and order hangover food, before getting straight back on track the next day.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/02/SNS-19831837-Dundee-v-Partick-810x564.jpg ","title":"dundee jordon forster","story":"Dundee defender Jordon Forster has opened up on the surreal nature of the football shutdown.With the sporting world brought to a halt by the coronavirus, the -year-old admits the Dee squad are stunned by the events of the past week.The   campaign was put on hold just as James McPake’s side had started to find form in the Championship.He told the Edinburgh Evening News: “We’re basically playing it by ear at the moment. We’re just taking it day by day, trying to maintain fitness and looking after ourselves as best we can.“It’s a really hard situation to explain. It doesn’t feel real.“We’ve just been told football’s now stopped and we don’t know when we’ll be playing again.“Everything’s just been shut down all of a sudden and it’s a really weird feeling. It’s not really sunk in yet.”Dundee have gone six matches unbeaten, with five consecutive clean sheets, and sit third in the table.The Dens men are just four points behind second-placed Inverness Caley Thistle, who they were due to play this weekend before the cancellations.Forster said: “The season as a whole hasn’t been good enough for us but the way things were going recently, it was starting to look positive for us with regard to hitting form in the lead-up to the play-offs.“There was a real bit of optimism building and it’s frustrating that that momentum has just been stopped with no indication of when we’re going to be able to play again, andwe are going to be able to play again this season at all.“I’m a big believer that whatever is going to be will be. You can only worry about things you can control # and this situation is definitely out with our control.”The loan signing of Scotland international Christophe Berra from Hearts has made a huge dference.Berra, , was bombed out by Daniel Stendel after the former Barnsley manager’s Tynecastle appointment in December.Forster said: “Big Christophe has done well for us. He’s got a lot of experience and he’s played at a high level so it’s good for defenders like myself to play alongside him.“You can learn loads from a guy like that. We’re similar types of players, we both like to defend first and foremost.“We pride ourselves on clean sheets and things were going reasonably well for us before the shutdown.”Forster – who was in Celtic’s academy before making the senior breakthrough at Hibs – feels he was held back by injuries in the early part of his career and he is delighted to put that frustration behind him.He said: “I feel the best I’ve ever felt physically and mentally. I take a lot of pride in my performance and I feel like over the past couple of years I’ve found a way of managing my body that works well.“I don’t think I’ve missed a game through injury for two years now so long may it continue.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united louis appere scotland u 21","story":"Dundee United manager Robbie Neilson is thrilled that Louis Appere has been called-up to the Scotland U  squad – evenit means his forward could miss a title-clinching night in Arbroath.The -year-old has enjoyed a career-transforming season after being farmed out to Broughty Athletic juniors.On histo Tannadice, the Fer took his chance in pre-season and has gone on to make  appearances, scoring six goals.Also picked by Scot Gemmill for the U s is Cha’s Billy Gilmour, who had been tipped for a senior call-up ahead of the Euro  play-off semi-final against Israel.Scotland play Croatia at Tynecastle on Friday, March , the same night that United travel to Gayfield.They then face Greece away on Tuesday, March .Neilson may also have to do without Lawrence Shankland,he keeps his place in the full squad for the Euro  play-offs.“It’s phenomenal,” said the United boss.“Louis has been brilliant.

But, at the same time, I also completely disagree.While our minds are being blown with stress and mild panic about being shut in our homes and where we’re going to locate our next roll of toilet paper, we all desperately need a release to think about something .Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney + and the rest will be doing a roaring trade right now as people figure out what to fill spare time with.It’s exactly the same for football debate – there’s no games but that doesn’t stop the debate, thankfully.Doesn’t make le easy for a football writer, mind you . . .Nor is it easy for the likes of Ian Maxwell and Neil Doncaster as they attempt to navigate the minefield that is now our game.The big clubs haven’t wasted any time in applying pressure for what they want to see – Celtic want to be awarded the title, Rangers obviously disagree and Hearts don’t want to be relegated.I have to say, apart from the Hearts viewpoint, it’s all pretty nauseating.What the heid honchos have on their plate right now is probably the biggest decision ever in the history of Scottish football.The Rangers Sevco debate pales in comparison and it’s not like we’ve ever heard the end of that one in Glasgow.Definitely rather them than me. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, whatever decision they come to, it’s going to hurt somebody.And I think they were right to give themselves some breathing space with Monday’s statement.Personally, I’d have picked a date in the middle of April and said we’ll see what’s what at that point with some plans thought up in the meantime.Initially, I was in favour of restarting the season in the autumn and then running straight into the new one, maybe scrap the League Cup. The transfer window and players’ contracts ending in May June just makes that a can of worms.Now, though, I’ll echo my colleague Lee Wilkie’s thoughts yesterday – expand the structure and keep as many clubs happy as possible.As in so many situations in le – do what big Wilkie says . . .It was only right Uefa postpone the European Championship until next summer – there was no other call to make.The championships would have put a completely unreasonable time limit on getting club football – whenever it gets going again – finished in time.However, the decision to knock the qualying play-offs back to June seems very short-sighted.I would be delightedany football is played before June, to be honest.I really think we’re in for a long, long haul of society shutting down to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.And Uefa should be aware they will likely just have to kick the can on the play-offs down the road again in three months’ time.They are such massive games for countries like us and I’m sure Scotland boss Steve Clarkewill want his players to have been in action for a few weeks going into the Israel game.Very little of this situation is fair but I can’t help but think Uefa have been a bit quick to make these decisions.Dundee and Dundee United have more to lose from this season being cancelled than almost anybody.Hearts would be the exception and possibly Partick.However, missing out on a place in the Premiership, particularly for United when it was nailed on, would be massively unfair. The Dark Blues can make an argument themselves about the play-offs, too.The work, and pots of cash, already put in this season has to count for something.THE world might be going down the drain but I have to try to see a silver lining. With the season stopped and, possibly declared null and void, my team Queen of the South can’t be relegated, so there’s that . . ."},{"url":null,"title":"kanzen karate announces cancellation of its international competition in may","story":"Kanzen Karate has announced it has had to cancel its international competition, The Kanzen Cup.The th Kanzen Cup International Open was scheduled to take place in May.

Fervent fight fans flocked to Tannadice to see Jim Mack and Jim Crawford slug it out in the squared circle.A working class city with a love for the fights, Dundee was a boxing hotbed for decades.Although the city’s history with the professional game stretches back to , that night on August   was to be the catalyst for a glorious boom period.Someone who has the honour of being one of the few men to have boxed at Tannadice Park is sports broadcaster Frank Gilfeather.An accomplished fighter in his day, Frank boxed on a unique show at the stadium in .He said: “I had been the Scottish amateur lightweight champion at the time and I boxed a guy called Robert Porteous from Edinburgh. There was a clash of heads and my eye had been cut so it was ruled a draw.“The ring was on the pitch and there would have been about , people there. I don’t recall there ever being an event like that in amateur boxing.”Boxing took centre stage at Tannadice again in September . A winless Hop Lawson picked up his first victory against veteran Frank Johnson.Contests dwindled until  when the newly constructed Caird Hall would kick-off its pugilistic legacy.Big time boxing wouldto the outdoors in  – this time on the home turf of the Dark Blues.On an epic night at Dens Park, local hero Jim Brady toppled Londoner Pat Palmer to win the British Southern Area bantamweight title, his first championship victory.Although not known as a knockout artist, Brady was highly regarded for his measured and skilful boxing. He would later go on to train Frank during his amateur days.“He had been my trainer at the St Francis Boxing Club,” Frank added.“Brady was a little man with big, bushy eyebrows and he owned a kiosk on Lochee Road. Everybody knew Jim, whether it was from the boxing or through getting their fags or a Tully.“You had to look up to him in terms of the quality of boxers he faced. He was an elusive fighter, he was careful.”On the same show, Freddie Tennant would also knockout Wishaw’s Abe Tweedlie to win the Scottish flyweight title.The Scottish heavyweight title was contested just over a year later at Dens between Alex Bell and Bob Scally. One of Scotland’s greatest ever boxers, Jackie Paterson, also fought on the show.Football shut down as the Second World War raged. The final whistle may have sounded on the beautul game but the opening bell was about to be rung.On a bizarre, snow-laden night on New Year’s Day , almost , hardy souls huddled together at Tannadice to cheer on Brady against Richie Kid Tanner.History repeated itself from three years prior and the battling Brady claimed the Commonwealth bantamweight title after a points victory.Dens would host the city’s last two stadium events, the penultimate in August  which saw Tennant take on Johnny Kelly before Terry Allen boxed Freddie’s brother Norman Tennant in June .Dundee’s halcyon boxing era brings back great memories for Frank but he believes the city will never see its likes again.He added: “The fight game here is dead now. These guys like Brady and Freddie Tennant were boxing almost every week.“These guys would go out and fight anywhere they could to make money, they were right on the breadline but they were some of the best in Scotland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Every year, as the summer faded into autumn, it gave its gt of apples to anyone who happened to pass. Children from the local village who were always hungry would sit under it and eat ripe apples until they had tummy ache. Old folk would come and collect the apples to make pies, sauces and chutney.When the apples from the lower branches had been eaten, the children would climb and pick the ones higher up. It was a game to catch them and put them in a basket.There were so many apples that the older children had to carry the heavy baskets down to the village and shared the apples with everyone.The tree gave so many apples that everyone in the village had as many as they could eat or use. There were always plenty left over on the ground for the animals and insects who also feasted on the fallen ripe fruit. Thankfully nobody owned the tree, it had seeded itself many years ago on the verge of the road that led to the village.Then one year, a traveller arrived just as the apple tree was beginning to bear fruit. He sat under the tree and admired the beauty of it. The apples were ripening in the sun and one of them fell by his feet. He picked it up and ate it. It was crisp and sweet and really delicious.A group of children arrived from the village. ldquoHello mister, they said with a smile, ldquowersquove come to pick apples. They set about picking the most reachable ripe apples, while of course eating some of them in the process.ldquoWhat delicious apples, I must tell my we and children about them, said the traveller as he set off along the road.ldquoHere, said one of the children, holding out a handful of apples. ldquoThese are really ripe, give them to your family. We have more than enough to carry.The traveller smiled. ldquoHow kind, he said. He put them in his pockets and went on his way.But that evening, the child who had given the apples to the traveller was chastised by her parents. ldquoWhy did you do that  Now that man will come back with his family and take our apples.ldquoBut the tree gives us more apples than we can eat, the girl said, ldquosurely a few can be shared with people outside the village. Besides, the tree is by the side of the road, arenrsquot the apples for everyone, thatrsquos what yoursquove always said ldquoYes, they are for everyone, her father replied, ldquobut not just for anyone.His daughter was confused by this answer she didnrsquot understand what it meant. However, it seemed such a small and unimportant issue that she said nothing more of it. She knew that there would be more than enough apples for everyone, and even anyone.A few days later, when the girlrsquos grandmother went to collect ripe apples for a pie, she met the stranger with his we and two children. They had a small basket full of apples. The family were friendly and greeted the grandmother, but she ed a forced smile. She quickly collected her apples and rushed home.She told about the strangerrsquos family collecting the apples and the girlrsquos father was angry.ldquoSee, he said to his daughter, ldquoI told you they were not for just anyone. Now there will be none left for everyone .But his daughter was still confused. There were always many hundreds of apples. ldquoYou are young and donrsquot understand, he said. ldquoTomorrow we will get up early and make sure we can collect our share of the apples.The following day the family were up at the crack of dawn. They took all the baskets they could and went to the apple tree. Their neighbours peered out of the window, wondering what the family were doing.Then they saw them at the apple tree, filling many baskets of ripe apples. Later in the morning, some children from the village joined them.One of them went to pick up an apple that had just fallen. But the grandmother rushed and snatched it first and put it in her basket. So the child just smiled and gently shook a branch and another fell.When the familyrsquos baskets were full, they carried them back to the house. But it took them three trips, and the father left his daughter to guard the full baskets while he and the rest of the family carried as much they could.ldquoWhy are you collecting so many apples at once  asked one of her friends.The young girl nibbled her lip and looked at the ground. ldquoDonrsquot know really. My father says Irsquom too young to understand, but he says the apples are for everyone but not just anyone.ldquoWhorsquos anyone then She looked up and shook her head: ldquoNot sure, but anyone is taking our apples so we have to get them first.When the children of the village ed home with their apples, they told their parents what had happened.ldquoAnyone is taking our apples, so there will not be enough for everyone.The next day, more families got up early and set off for the apple tree.This time, the apple picking was very dferent to the way it had always been. In the past, people would pick the apples with each other, because everyone knew there was enough to go round. This time they were picking them for themselves.Fights started and people began to pull apples that were not ripe. So many people climbed onto the branches to get the apples that the tree started to creak.Soon, not a single apple remained on the tree. For the first time ever, there were none left for the animals or insects. Some peoplersquos homes were so full of apples that they hardly had room to move inside the house.Other people, who were not quick enough, had no apples at all. Some of these were people who really needed the apples. But those who had many wouldnrsquot share them for fear that anyone would get them.The houses of the people who collected more apples than they needed became full of fruit flies and other insects as their piles of apples began to rot.But the next year, everyone was ready. They had made big baskets and were determined not to miss out. But when they arrived at the tree it was surrounded by a hastily built wall with a guard at the gate.ldquoWho has done this  they cried.It was the king. He had heard of the apple tree and how crisp and sweet the apples were, so much so that people would fight and hoard the fruit. So, as the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom, he decided he would make sure the apples graced his table.ldquoBut there are more apples than the king can eat! protested the people.ldquoIndeed, said the guard ldquoand the King is generous. He will sell you the apples he does not need.ldquoSell them  But the apples have always been free for everyone!ldquoNot any more, said the guard.The young girl went up to her father. ldquoNow I understand, she said, ldquoanyone is the king."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-gp-practices-east-lothian-introduce-new-measures","story":"North Berwick Health Centre has announced that none of its registered patients have tested positive for coronavirus and asked that people phone the Edington Hospital in advance before paying it a visit.Those who think they have been in contact with someone with the virus are asked to not visit the surgery and phone  for advice.From Monday , all GP and advanced nurse practitionerappointment requests will be triagedby phone call.Lammermuir Medical Practice in Haddington has also taken this approach.People who call either practice will be asked for a summary of their symptoms, information about recent travel andthey have been in direct contact with a person that has been tested positive for coronavirus.The inidualrsquos GP will thenthe call anddeemed safe and necessary, they will then be given an appointment for that afternoon.Those with pre-booked appointments with a GP will be contacted by the health centre to discuss arrangements.North Berwick Health Centre has removed its self check in service -people now have to check in with a receptionist.It has also launched a new online prescription ordering service, those not registered can visit northberwickhealthcentre.scot.nhs.uk news,.htm, download a form, fill it in and hand it in.Lammermuir Medical Practice has also disabled its online appointment service.Tranent Medical Practice has made its surgery pod, a self-service device that allows patients to get their weight and blood pressure checked, unavailable for use.Those with routine appointments at Harbours Medical Practice in Cockenzie are asked to phone the practice, pressing option two, as it is making changes to its routine appointment system.It has also asked that people with symptoms, those who have had contact with an infected person or those who have been in an affected place to not enter any of its buildings.Prestonpans Group Practice has also given this advice and asked that evenpeople have mild symptoms they should not visit the surgery.Meanwhile, Orchard Medical Practice in Haddington is asking all patients not to attend the practice but instead to phone to request an appointment.

It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly.

That requires service reform and these reforms will require access to voluntary redundancy to be successfully delivered.The report adds the councilrsquos current policy provides a redundancy payment of up to  weeksrsquo pay for those with no access to immediate payment of pension and up to  weeksrsquo pay for those who have.Ms Forrest states: ldquoThe purpose of a redundancy scheme is to provide the council with a means to manage its workforce. To be effective, therefore, redundancy terms need to be attractive to employees.ldquoThis attractiveness, however, needs to be of set against a requirement that the exercise is also cost-effective.The scheme, which will run for three years, will launch with a ldquotrawl for registrations of interest by June . Last month, local authority watchdog the Accounts Commission praised the council for its handling of the dispute, which will cost poundm to settle. In a report it said by the end of August last year the council had settled the vast majority of claims.But in November there remained about  settlements outstanding, as well as  other claims. Some of these are ldquoinstances where the case has been dficult to finalise, including where the women involved had not ed signed agreement forms, or the claimant had died.The  other claimants are not being acted for by the main representatives, and the agreed settlement does not include them.

We found out about the iety of jobs they did and their childrenrsquos achievements at school.ldquoA lot of people will think of working-class houses like these as being very poor and very shabby, all looking the same. But that is not the case.Researchers were surprised to uncover more than  dferent wallpaper samples in the one tenement, most of them high-quality papers which have retained their vibrancy despite being papered over multiple times. They range from grand designs reflecting the late Victorian era to Art Nouveau papers, jazzy sixties and early seventies designs.ldquoEvery house has dferent paper, adds Walker. ldquoWe have got paper from  that would have been very expensive.ldquoThe late th-century papers are very heavily ornamented, with large patterns.ldquoFrom the twenties and thirties, there are real lsquoart decorsquo papers, while by the forties and fties they become very floral and lsquoFestival of Britainrsquo in style. Then by the early sixties, the colours are more mottled and itrsquos not as big and bold as it was.As well as highlighting families changing tastes and enthusiasm for keeping up with interior fashions, the findings shine a light on the way they lived and the choices they were able to make.It also raises the question of how families could seek out the latest styles of wallpaper, and the influences travel and their employersrsquo links with far-flung locations may have had on their choices.ldquoIt shows they decorated frequently, Walker continues. ldquoWe can see that they often changed their wallpaper every five or  years ndash which is possibly more than some of us do now. We can see that they took real pride in their houses.While decorating seems to have been a regular event, stripping off existing paper and carefully preparing the walls for a new layer ndash much to the researchersrsquo delight ndash was not. ldquoOne wall was found to have  layers of paper, adds Walker.Such is the scale of the find that there are plans to digitise the uncovered paper to create an archive for researchers interested in the history of the New Lanark site, but also designers concerned in long-lost patterns, colour trends and interior fashions.ldquoThere are very few photographs of inside familiesrsquo homes so the wallpapers are a very interesting way of finding out more about inside their homes.Once the exhibition opens, visitors will be able to stand in a virtual room while the walls sht to show the evolving wallpaper styles.Wallpaper conservator Allyson McDermott said: ldquoWithin the building there is a remarkable survival of a wealth of original materials and artefacts such as paint, wallpaper, linoleum and fireplaces offering an extraordinary insight into the decorative history of the lsquoordinaryrsquo domestic interior.Work on the exhibition has been funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Historic Environment Scotland through the New LanarkTH CARS project. It also explores the lesser-known history of The Gourock Ropework Company, the last company to operate at the site.The New Lanark cotton mills were founded in . By the early th century they were in the hands of a partnership that included Robert Owen, an influential social reformer. In Owenrsquos time, some , people lived at New Lanark, many from the poorhouses of Glasgow and Edinburgh. They benefited from services and schools.By the early s, New Lanark was owned by the Lanark Spinning Company, which went on to merge with The Gourock Ropework Company which remained in control until the mills closed in .In the early th century, an entire family would have lived one room. However, living conditions gradually improved and in the early th century the villagersquos proprietors provided free electricity.By , the houses had interior cold water taps for sinks and the communal outside toilets were replaced by inside facilities, and by  New Lanark was connected to the National Grid.The Tenement Through Time exhibition was to have opened this spring but, as with many events, it has been postponed until later this year."},{"url":null,"title":"peatlemania-meteoric-rise-three-musicians-lewis-told-tv","story":"There can barely be a less likely chart-topping musical trio imaginable: a toothless frontman, a delivery driver and an electrician, whose songs tell of le on the croft, partying on the moor and watching the telly.But with a guitar, an accordion, drumkit and wicked sense of humour ndash not to mention the fisherman-come-lead singerrsquos crowd-surfing arrival at Glasgowrsquos Barrowland in an inflatable dinghy ndash for fans of their unique island ldquocroft rock, Peat And Diesel are the hottest ticket in town.Theyrsquore the extremely down-to-earth trio who upended the saccharine Christmas single market with a rugged version of Fairytale Of New York ndash lyrics and title subtly changed to reflect their Stornoway roots.And against the odds, they found themselves propelled from their day jobs and weekend gigs at Stornowayrsquos Lewis Bar, to the venue every Scottish band wants to see bouncing to their music ndash the Barrowland ndash almost the next.Now the behind-the-scenes story of how Peat And Diesel charmed music fans with foot-stomping songs of island le sprinkled with larger-than-le characters and everyday events ndash from eating herring for dinner to riding in a matersquos rusty transit van ndash is set to be told.A BBC Alba documentary, Thatrsquos The Way We Do It, which charts the grouprsquos unforeseen rise, reveals the triorsquos own surprise at how rapidly they careered from bashing out a few unlikely tunes in their front rooms, to selling out the famous Glasgow venue in less than  minutes, and scooping Live Act Of The Year at the Scots Trad Music Awards.According to the bandrsquos accordion player, father-of-two electrician Innes Scott, therersquos no-one more shocked at their rapid rise to fame than him and his Peat And Diesel bandmates ndash delivery driver and drummer Uilleam ldquoUilly MacLeod, and fisherman-frontman Callum ldquoBoydie MacLeod.ldquoIt started with us just playing around and having a bit of craic on Saturday nights, he says. ldquoOne night after too many beers, Boydie came up with this half-Gaelic, half-English song that we posted on Facebook. Almost overnight it got , views. Two days later we were asked to do our first festival.That was quite an ask, he recalls, as the band at that point only knew two songs and didnrsquot even have a name.Yet somehow, Peat And Diesel rose to the challenge. Within weeks, Boydiersquos fishing boat was tied up in Stornoway harbour while the band cut their first album at the townrsquos Wee Studios.The result, Uptown Fank, was peppered with oddities. The well-known nineties song Brimful Of Asha turned up with Boydiersquos new lyrics about being fed a Plate Full Of Sgadanby his granny, and another ndash Kenny Dhomhnaill Fhionnlaigh ndash recounts what sounds like an extremely boisterous night out in the local pub.The album was launched at last yearrsquos Mull Music Festival and set alight a new craze ... Peatlemania.Almost instantly Peat And Diesel were in demand. A Celtic Connections gig at Oran Mor was organised, only for the  tickets to sell out within minutes of going on sale. Within three hours the gig was moved to the Barras. Thirty minutes later, all the tickets for that venue were snapped up too.ldquoNo-one could have foreseen what has happened, promoter Robert Hicks, of Beyond, tells the documentary. ldquoI think that itrsquos easy to liken them to the phenomenon that have been the likes of Lewis Capaldi and Gerry Cinnamon, and how their rises have been meteoric.ldquoBut the thing to keep reminding yourselves is those guys have all put in the groundwork, done the small shows and built to a point where itrsquos suddenly exploded. Peat And Diesel have skipped that a bit, suddenly they are lsquobangrsquo at the Barrowlands.Donald Shaw, the artistic director of Celtic Connections, says the bandrsquos success is unprecedented ... but well deserved. ldquoThere are no airs and graces, itrsquos really raw and real.The bandrsquos roaring success rests largely with ldquogumsy singer-songwriter, Boydie, a free spirit with an eye for an amusing lyric, rasping vocals, thick Lewis accent and extraordinary guitar skills.ldquoItrsquos the way he is, says Innes Scott, who uses his holidays from his job maintaining the runway electrics at Stornoway Airport for Peat And Diesel gigs across the country.ldquoLe doesnrsquot bother Boydie. He doesnrsquot care about what day it is or what hersquos supposed to be doing.ldquoHe likes to do his own thing ndash it can be hard work dealing with him, he groans. ldquoI donrsquot know how many times Irsquom close to strangling him.ldquoBut he has something special ... therersquos something there that is magic.The bandrsquos success has come so fast that its members are still racing to catch up. While Innes and Uilly balanced their new le with the day job, Boydie faced increasing pressure to produce another collection of toe-tapping, smile-along songs to create the bandrsquos second album.Light My Byre was recently released to coincide with ticket sales for more gigs. The documentary shows it being recorded at breakneck pace and without much in the way of fine-tuning to ensure the bandrsquos raw edges arenrsquot glossed over.ldquoHalf the tracks on the new album we canrsquot play yet because wersquove not properly learned them, admits Innes. ldquoWe never usually bother about practising.Now, of course, there is unexpected time on their hands for practice.Before the Covid- crisis, Peat And Diesel were inches away from a sell-out Irish tour, with a host of summer festivals and an end-of-year tour in the pipeline.Now most gigs are off and the challenge is whether Scotlandrsquos maddest musical stars can pick up where they left off.ldquoI had been using up my holidays in order to play and falling behind at work. I suppose now therersquos a chance to get back on track, adds Innes, who intends to finally start building the family house thatrsquos been on hold while on the road.ldquoI donrsquot think it will lose momentum.

Over the same period last year, there were none.It comes as CalMac managed to overcome faults with the ageing MV Caledonian Isles last week, which led to the service coming to a standstill, with dozens of cancelled sailings and questions in the Scottish Parliament.CalMac had said the latest issue with the -year-old vessel was with the mooring winch gearbox which meant the vessel was \"unable to safely berth during periods of adverse weather\". Repairs were expected to take six weeks but executives managed to resolve the issue earlier.: The \"shocking\" state of Scotlandrsquos leline ferries laid bare - nearly half should be retiredCalMac managing director Robbie Drummond said they were \"approached about the possibility of leasing the MV Pentalina a few months ago\".He added: \"However, we reviewed the capabilities of the vessel in great detail and looked at her ability to berth at both Ardrossan and Brodick. The conclusion was that she would not be suitable for use on the network.\"It comes as CalMac bosses have said the poundm ferries \"shambles\" at Ferguson Marines shipyard in Port Glasgow is causing knock-on major disruption for island communities up and down the west coast of Scotland.Five years ago, Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow was handed a pound million contract to build the two ferries.Dual fuel replacement Arran ferry Glen Sannox and her as yet unnamed sister were due to enter service in mid- but the calamitous contract has doubled in price and before the coronavirus pandemic, it was estimated work on the vessels wont be finished until at least .Islanders have previously raised concerns over the pound million project to reposition Brodick harbour by  degrees. It is claimed the new position has led to a spike in cancellations because it has made the high-sided vessels which serve the port more susceptible to easterly winds.Gavin Fulton, chairman of Arrans ferry action group said: \"Ardrossan has always been an unreliable harbour made worse by lack of maintenance. Gourock, our harbour of refuge, is unusable.\"And the new Brodick pier is compromised due to oversight in the design process and now to add to these problems our ship breaks down on a regular basis. So all aspects of our ferry service are vulnerable creating the perfect storm for the Arran route.\"Ardrossan-Brodick is CalMacrsquos busiest route, carrying , of its .m passengers last year.: Scottish ferries fiasco - Questions over shipyard deals as illegal state aid cases emergeIn the beginning of February, there were at least three days of disruption with an engine fault on the MV Caledonian Isles cited as a major cause.Mid-February cancellations were caused by poor weather and what the ferry operator describes as the failure of a navigational aid. And further cancellations later in the month were put down to bad weather.In October, the crossing had to be rerouted indefinitely after the vehicle gangways failed and a usual fallback option was out of service.CalMac sailings to and from were cancelled after both gangways, or linkspans failed in what is understood to be a problem with their hydraulics.The MV Caledonian Isles to and from Brodick on the isle of Arran would ordinarily have been switched to Gourock instead, but the linkspan there has been out of action for the last three weeks.The Arran service was forced to use Troon as ldquoan emergency port, even though it lacks passenger and parking facilities, as it is principally a cargo port.When the latest raft of cancellations hit the service, Nicola Sturgeon said: \"It is clearly a matter of great regret that passengers are facing disruption and I absolutely understand the frustration.\"While the vessel continues in service it does so with operating restrictions. The Master assessed the situation and introduced a wind speed limit restriction.\"A Transport Scotland spokesman said:ldquoWhile these are operational matters for CalMac, masters are accountable for all decisions on board to ensure the safety of crew, passengers and the asset. This is underpinned by UK legislation which deems any attempt to restrict or influence Mastersrsquo decisions a criminal offence. Decisions to cancel or delay a sailing are not taken lightly and are based on multiple factors as ferry operators know the consequences of decisions are far reaching. That is why, in August , we announced a pound. million Resilience Fund with an additional pound million being allocated to this within the - budget to invest in services to ensure future reliability and availability of vessels.ldquoMore widely, Transport Scotland is currently working with CMAL and CalMac to develop investment programmes for major vessels and small vessels with the aim of increased standardisation, taking account of the many and ied routes which CalMac serves. The latest Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan is in final drafting and the intention is to publish this Spring.\"We look forward to working with all interested parties to continue to deliver improvements, building on the substantial investment in routes, services, vessels, harbours and fares which have been made in these services in recent years and which have led to signicant improvements in connectivity, capacity, affordability and passenger numbers.\"The successor to the Ferries Plan - is being developed following the recent publication of the National Transport Strategy and the National Islands Plan and in conjunction with the Strategic Transport Projects Review which will also consider all potential viable future options in connecting our islands. The Scottish Government continues to work with CalMac, communities and business interest to ensure leline ferry connections are maintained and enhanced.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10147678.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-scotland-msp-miles-briggs-calls-army-scots-volunteers-help-elderly-pandemic","story":"As more hospital beds will be needed for coronavirus victims, patients who are fit to go home should receive assistance from volunteers who can carry our many non-medical tasks.Currently more than , medically fit patients are \"bed-blocking\", unable to leave because there is nowhere suitable to go to receive care.But Scottish Conservative health spokesman, Miles Briggs, believes now is the time for a complete overhaul of how social care is provided to elderly and disabled people.He warned that the situation is going to get worse as the virus takes hold and action is needed now to unblock the system.He said: ldquoI have had emails from constituents, some of whom have non-medical skills, who want to assist.:The Brae owners in tears over abusive messages after offering NHS staff free mealsldquoThose sort of people could be enlisted to help.

For example, there has been little so far to help those who are self-employed and reliant on Orkney’s key tourism market.#Similarly, with the closure of export markets, local fishermen have been in touch to highlight the crisis facing parts of the local inshore sector.“I welcome the moves that both Scottish and UK Ministers have taken to date, but there is quite clearly more than needs to be done, both for businesses and their staff.#At the same time, at a local level, Orkney Islands Council will need to consider what support it is able to provide to help ensure that key businesses within our local economy are able survive over the next few months.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In such places, even a move to zero new infections as in and around Hebei, China is no measure of safety, because ing citizens will endanger a second wave of infection.Prof Ian Inkster, SOAS, London..."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus cases rise by one ","story":"The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the isles has risen to .One further person has tested positive for the virus, according to Scottish government figures published at pm on Wednesday.Across Scotland the number rose to , up from , with three deaths now reported.The testing regime has changed since the response to the pandemic moved into the “delay” phase, meaning that only tests undertaken for people who are unwell in hospital with suspected Covid- are being taken, and there will be no community testing.When will NHS Shetland implement WHO recommendations on isolation  These include anyone in close contact with a case two days before symptoms should be tested, and self isolation should continue for two weeks after symptoms disappear.Transparency would also be useful, for example # has pestilence reached every corner of the isles yet  Are the high numbers because it is peaking earlier in Shetland than mainland Scotland  When will testing as per WHO recommendations be implemented Your questions are entirely valid Helen. What is alarming is how little challenge there has been to our government#s decision to take a dferent path from that recommended by the World Health Organisation . Shetland, Scotland and the UK is out of synch with almost everywhere  in how we are trying to tackle this coronavirus. We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  .

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!.

It was bizarre... my le seems to be shaped by geopolitical disasters.About nine months ago, his team at Boston Children#s Hospital received a €m federal government grant to help develop an influenza vaccine for elderly people and children.However, the Co Wicklow man had been keeping a close watch on coronavirus developments in China, and three months ago his team got government approval to turn it into a dual project.There are now dozens of projects worldwide working around the clock to create a coronavirus vaccine, but Dr Dowling is co-leading a project which is specically targeting the most vulnerable in society - the elderly.Older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with Covid-, according to the World Health Organisation.Together with Dr Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines programme at the hospital, Dr Dowling is designing a coronavirus vaccine that uses special molecules to boost the immune system.The coronavirus gets its name because each cell is covered with spiky formations that make it look like a crown, or in Latin #corona#. These are called spike proteins.The vaccine will use the virus#s spike protein along with known vaccine adjuvants - small molecules that increase a patient#s immune response.He and Dr Levy#s team have taken blood samples from patients aged between  and , are separating their white blood cells and testing dferent adjuvants to see which work best.The unique vaccine will build on vaccines from prior coronavirus outbreaks and work to make them more effective.I reached out to Dr Peter Hotez at Texas Children#s Hospital and we got his Sars antigen from the  outbreak, Dr Dowling said.He made a vaccine and never got it all the way into clinical trials and ran out of funding as it [Sars] wasn#t an issue any more.So using the current Sars vaccine and mixing it with our best adjuvant, we hope it can make a dference.As for a timeline on when the vaccine may be ready, Dr Dowling says it largely depends on funding.I spent  hours filling out a grant application for this coronavirus project, when that time could be spent far more practically, he said.Dr Dowling thinks developing a vaccine is imperative, as he believes coronavirus could become a seasonal virus.I do believe that it may have been circulating for a long time and has only come to the forefront now, he said.Right now we are heading towards the peak of it, people are social distancing and we#ll see it relax coming into summer, but there is a distinct possibility it could come back again in winter.That#s why we have to keep working and can#t take time off. I have great confidence in my colleagues and the US government that we can push through to develop a vaccine.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Independent.ie  Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHealth chief says Covid- war ‘can be won with communities’Health Service Executive chief Paul Reid has said the country faces into a “an uncertain, unprecedented and unpredictable” time during the Covid- pandemic.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Eileen with her daughter Siobhan on Siobhan’s wedding day, wearing the blue outfit she had wanted to be buried inCatherine FeganMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailEileen O’Neill knew death was approaching. She had been in isolation since last Friday, shunted away from the people she loved and desperately frightened by everything she could see around her.Faceless figures in biohazard suits, double-gloved hands checking her pulse, knowing glances behind medical-grade goggles.She was lucid and conscious, right up to the very end, in the solitary company of a virus she had feared would come for her long before it did.“Mum had told me she was afraid of getting it,” her daughter Siobhan said.“For her to get it and then be put in isolation was extremely frightening for her. I know she was scared. I know that. That’s the reality of this virus. You can’t be with someone you love when they need you. All the normal things you do when someone is sick and approaching the end, like mopping their brow, holding their hand, whispering into their ear, you can’t do any of that and that person is completely alone.”Less than a week ago, -year-old Eileen, a glamorous, independent woman who had overcome numerous health battles, entered an isolation ward in St Vincent’s hospital, Dublin.She had fallen ill at home in Loughlinstown and paramedics recorded a high temperature. She was immediately tested for Covid-.Eileen was put in an isolation ward and her family were not allowed to visit. Her test result on Sunday was positive.“When I got the call from the hospital I knew straight away that was it,” said Siobhan. “I knew it would take more than a miracle to pull her through this. I askedhad she been told and they initially said no. I was relieved to hear that because she herself was so frightened of Covid and I knew it would have a negative effect on her. And then there was the fact we couldn’t be with her, I knew that would compound things.”From that point on, Eileen O’Neill’s end-of-le journey took a path her heart-broken loved ones had to send her on alone. The protocols were clear. Under no circumstances could any family members go to see her. Instead, communication would be done by phone. Two years away from turning , Eileen was still working off an “old brick mobile”. There would be no Facetime, no picture exchanges.“It was extremely dficult,” said Siobhan. “But we knew how serious the virus was and that we had to abide by the rules.”For Siobhan Cullen and her family, the news that Eileen had become infected with the deadly virus came as a shock. Due to her underlying respiratory issues, all the necessary precautions had been taken to ensure she was protected long before any cases were recorded here.“She was completely immobile due to a previous stroke,” said Siobhan.“The past two weeks she gave no indication that there was anything wrong with her, apart from being tired. We were all very, very cautious around her. She hadn’t been out of the house since February and she had only seen five people, all of whom had been taking precautions. Her two carers have tested negative for the virus and the other three people, including me, were all family.”Alone, frightened and unaware of the growing pandemic claiming lives across the world, Eileen counted down the hours in silence.“She was alone,” said Siobhan.“I know she was getting the best care, but I also know there was no one sitting beside her. I know she was looking at all those people coming and going, suited and booted, and she would have known why. That’s heart-breaking for me to think about.”Last weekend, as the nation got to grips with a sweeping set of measures, Siobhan remained at home, powerless. She was now in self-isolation, following the advice of her GP, waiting to be tested. Updates on her mother’s condition were regular, but she knew there was an increasing climate of caution. She began to make plans for the possibility that her mother might not survive.“I asked the staff at St Vincent’s Hospitalwe would be allowed to get in to see herit came to the end,” she said. “Through no fault of anyone, the protocols on this are changing on the hour. One lady I spoke to said yes, arrangements would be made... and the next time when she[Eileen] was moved I was told there were no guarantees. That was hard for me to hear.”By Tuesday, Eileen had been moved closer to a nurses’ station where she could be monitored evermore closely. The following day, Siobhan got a call, asking her to come to see her mother.“I knew it was time. Nothing prepares you for what you have to do to see a loved one dying from this.”In an isolated area behind a reception desk, Siobhan and her brother Kenneth took instruction from two nurses and a doctor on how to robe up for entry into the isolation unit: covers over their shoes a full- gown with full sleeves two pairs of gloves, one placed over the other. Each step of the way, washing their hands.That was just the start.“There is a beanie-type hat for your head that you tie at the back,” recalled Siobhan. “You have a facemask but it’s not the normal facemask that you tie at the back. It’s much tougher and it completely seals your mouth and nosetotally. It expands as you breathe.“You have a pair of goggles and then over the goggles you put on a full facial visor. They have hand gel there and at every step you are washing your hands as well. My mum was totally conscious when we walked in like that.”As they were guided along a corridor, Siobhan and Kenneth were told that once they were with their mother, they could not touch her face, but were permitted to hold her hand. “I was very conscious thatwe didn’t abide by that we wouldn’t be let in.“That was my big fear because the protocols were changing daily. I was just so happy to get to see her that I didn’t want to put a foot wrong.“My brother couldn’t stay. He just couldn’t do it. We had to tell her who we were, but that wasn’t because she wasn’t conscious or didn’t recognise us, it was because everyone looked the same.”Faced with a situation that was growing ever more beyond her control, Siobhan decided not to tell her mother that she was nearing the end of her le.“I just didn’t want to frighten her,” she said.“I didn’t want her to know why I was there, and when she asked I just said that I got fed up not being able to hold her hand. The doctor played along. I think that deep down my mum knew why I was there. I know in my heart that she knew the truth, but she went with it.”As day turned to night, Siobhan kept vigil at her mother’s bedside, listening as she struggled to breathe, but clung to le. Anything that went into the room could not go out, so she had no mobile phone and was unable to communicate with family.“I stayed all night,” she said. “I was there, in all that gear, holding her hand. I talked to her all night long, about my dad, about when we were young, about her grandkids. I talked and talked and talked. I told her daddy was waiting for her. I said rosaries out loud, rosaries in my head.“She kept telling me to go home. Her breathing was very poor and deteriorating. She was literally fighting for a breath. At one stage she said to me, ‘Do you think I’ll pull through this ’ I said, ‘I don’t think so, Mam’.”It was a lonely night, recalled Siobhan. She had kept vigil before beside people who had died and the reassuring visit of a nurse on those occasions, in and out in a show of support, had always been a comfort. Covid- denied her any such humanity.“I was so aware that no one could come in,” said Siobhan. “You don’t have the staff coming in and out to check on you or comfort you. Nobody was coming in unless they absolutely had to. It was so cold and clinical.”Eileen passed away shortly after pm on Wednesday. She struggled until the very end.“She had a horrendous death,” said Siobhan. “When she died, I sat with her for an hour, holding her hand and then I had to be pragmatic about what would happen next. I knew there was a chance we wouldn’t get her personal belongings back so I had to remove all her jewellery and take it there and then. It sounds so mercenary but that’s what I had to do.”The most dficult conversations came next. Siobhan was told that her mother’s body would be “double bagged” in a high-spec body bag. Eileen would not be taken to the chapel of rest, but instead to a specially designated area in the morgue.“The staff there had to leave. The people who met us had to be gowned. We couldn’t touch her, and we got  minutes with her. I want people to understand how devastating that was.”This week, as she self-isolated, Siobhan prepared for her mother’s burial in circumstances that are hard to believe.Consultations with the undertaker have had to be done via video-link. Mourners have not been able to call to her home. Grief is being held in suspension while Covid- tightens its grip over a family in a very surreal time of despair.“Death is very much a part of le,” said Siobhan. “Here in Ireland, we commemorate the dead so well. For us, trapped at home at the mercy of this virus, there are no arms to fall into for a hug. My friends can’t come and pay their respects. We can’t come together and mourn. People need to understand the devastating domino effect of this virus and all that it brings to your door.”Struck down by coronavirus at the age of , the long le of Eileen O’Neill will today end with a short ceremony at a funeral parlour in Dublin.It will not be the ending she wanted. Her funeral wishes, expressed long ago to her nearest and dearest, included carefully selected hymns and readings. She had picked out the flowers, the gts, the pallbearers. She wanted to be dressed in the navy outfit she wore to Siobhan’s wedding.None of that will be possible. Today, in a small funeral home in Dublin, four people will gather to say their farewells. Communion will be passed around on tissue paper. There will be no burial Mass.“This virus is vicious, and it leaves people to die an extremely lonely death. My mother will be buried with just four of us present. Her coffin will have to be disinfected after we leave her and none of us can grieve with our wider family and friends because we have to self-isolate until we are tested.“This is the cruellest end to a le.” In memory of Eileen, Siobhan is asking readers to consider donating to Feed The Heroes herePlease log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Independent.ie  Related ContentCoronavirusFunerals should be held in private, mourners urgedChurches here are urging their clergy to hold all funerals in private because of the coronavirus crisis.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Social distancing is vital to combat the spread of Covid-, the PSNI said.In other parts of Northern Ireland some continued to ignore the advice.While most cafes, restaurants and pubs in Londonderry adhered to government recommendations, in neighbouring towns of Coleraine, Portrush and Portstewart, for some it was business as normal.Serving staff in bars, cafes and restaurants cannot keep two metres from members of the public while carrying out their job and remain safe, which helped many owners make the decision to shut up shop.Derry City Centre manager Jim Roddy said: Some businesses including restaurants are being imaginative and have adjusted their businesses in ways that don#t put their staff or the public at risk and keep to the principles of safe distancing.A spokeswoman for the Causeway Chamber of Commerce said its members were looking to the Government for clarity on the issue of opening.She said: Council has no power to direct premises to close or enforce social distancing.It is the responsibility of everyone to follow the relevant guidance and once again we would urge everyone to play their part in the fight against Covid-.A leading retail chief called on the public to follow the clear guidelines as lives depend on it.Retail NI#s Glyn Roberts also called on the Executive to set up a single Covid--related website and social media channel to make sure the right messages are getting across to the public.It#s been made very, very clear that we all need to follow the advice, he said. We simply have to. Lives depend on it and that message has to get through.That#s why Retail NI will be asking the Executive to set up a specic website and social media channel to make sure the correct and relevant advice is there for all.At the minute advice is coming from all dferent departments and there#s so much out there that#s irrelevant or wrong. We need a single coordinated  that people can trust. We#re really seeing the benefit social media can have in getting information across, but it needs to be from a single, coordinated source.We really have to follow to the letter what the advice is. We have those who are working in the retail trade, the people serving us in shops to think of as well.They are providing an invaluable service by remaining open and we owe it to them all to abide by the rules as much as we possibly can.The Public Health Agency also warned of the threat posed by Covid-the social distancing guidelines are not followed.Dr Van Woerden said: We understand that this will be dficult, particularly with Mother#s Day this weekend for example, so it is worth looking at keeping in touch using your phone, the internet and social media.If you are outdoors, stay more than two metres away from others.As part of the effort to reduce the spread, only use the phone or online facilities to contact your GP or other essential services.We strongly advise you to follow the measures as much as you can and to signicantly limit your face-to-face interaction with friends and familypossible, particularlyyou are over , have an underlying health condition or are pregnant.Scientists said social measures will need to be in place for most of a year at least in order to control the spread of Covid-.The Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling agreed on Monday that, while the severity of measures could alternate during the period, stricter measures would need to be enforced for at least half of the year to keep cases at a level the NHS can cope with.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadTributes paid after popular Ballyclare HS teacher Dr Austin Millar diesCoronavirus: Keep your distance... a simple rule, but too many ignoring itMotorcyclist killed in Bangor road accident named as Andrew Browning Murder investigation launched after Ballymena stabbingCoronavirus: Northern Ireland head boys and girls post inspirational messages for health workers and elderly,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We will get through this, but onlywe work together. Thank you for remaining strong and calm. Never forget that there is light at the end of the tunnel. “To the vulnerable, the elderly and those at high-risk of catching COVID- or those currently suffering – please be strong. You are in our thoughts and prayers. You will get through this have faith… we believe in you. “To those in the world at this time helping turn adversity into advantage – we see you and you are amazing. To those businesses who are putting need over profit at this dficult time by offering food to those less able, by setting up community initiatives to give back to the community who give to you you are making the world a better place and the world sends you a great amount of gratitude. “To everyone who has been affected by COVID-, directly or indirectly… in the words of Buzz Lightyear, “The important thing is that we stick together.” “Let’s stick together.

There, I’ve said it. It wasn’t that hard really. The truth is that I don’t always wear my Catholic badge with pride. There are things that I like and dislike about the Catholic Church, but I am a practising Catholic, and in a world where that isn’t always the coolest thing to say, I don’t mind saying it, out loud.I’ve always been a believer, I was raised in a devoutly Catholic family. I remember the pride in my parents’ faces at church when a woman pointed at me and my brother and sisters, and said she’d never seen a family so well-behaved at Mass.My faith had good foundations because of the people around me. My earliest memory of church is being taken to Benediction with my granny, nose pressed to the seat in front of me as I knelt, listening to the priest recite lines and lines of Latin phrases that I couldn’t understand. The memory of my granny’s wrinkled hand in mine guiding me through the Rosary beads, and the smell of incense is as real to me now, as it was then.As a teenager, I went to Mass every night, something I kept a closely-guarded secret from all my friends. I didn’t want to be called a Holy Joe. While my friends were all getting part-time jobs in what was the newly-opened Foyleside in the early s, my first job was in the priests’ house, where there was always a stack of black shirts that needed ironed.After moving to Belfast in  to attend Queen’s University, my faith seemed to drt. I did attend a few events in the University Catholic Chaplaincy, but the freedom of living away from home and the pub culture meant my churchgoing took a hit.It didn’t bother me. I attended Mass sporadically over the years – Christmas, weddings, funerals, and whenever my parents forced me to. I hadn’t stopped believing, but that need to go to Mass just wasn’t there anymore. I suppose as I’ve got older I had been thinking about my faith more, and a chance opportunity to attend Lough Derg in  changed everything for me. I was working as a journalist and was asked to attend with a group of pilgrims from the Derry Diocese along with Bishop Donal McKeown. I thought nothing more of it than that it would make a good story.The three days I spent on the island ended up being much more than research for a newspaper article. The peace of Lough Derg, and the break from the constant distraction of the modern world gave me the space to reconnect with my faith. I hadn’t been to Confession for over  years believing it to be outdated and unnecessary, but at Lough Derg, I experienced a new, grown-up type of confession that dfered from my childish practice of rhyming off sins.Now, aged , I hope I have a much more mature attitude to my faith. I don’t hide the fact that I go to Mass, because I really don’t care what other people think about that.But being a Catholic, and someone who is not afraid to say they are a Catholic comes with its own challenges. The Church has been through dficult years with issues that can never be brushed under the carpet. Friends of mine have told me they’ll neverto Mass because they’ll never trust the Church again. Many of my friends, while they don’t share my faith, have the deepest respect for it. On a recent weekend away to England with buddies, I announced on the Saturday night that I was going to find a chapel to go to Mass. Instead of going alone, I ended up taking ten people along with me.Having faith isn’t always something that comes naturally – there are days when I feel I’m just going through the motions and doubting everything, and there are other days when I feel completely connected to God.I know that in the most dficult situations in my le I have felt God’s presence with me. That can sometimes be a dficult statement to make, when being a card-carrying Catholic and a woman of faith is something that is so easily ridiculed in modern society. I can’t say I do, or will ever agree with all aspects of the Catholic Church. The Church has much work to do. More recognition must be given to the vital role played by women, and I hope some day that church will be more accepting of same-sex relationships. I’ve seen first-hand the upset caused to my gay friends who have felt abandoned by the church. My faith will always be important to me. Because I’m so vocal about it, I’m often stopped by people who ask me to pray for a special intention for them, light a candle, or even asked where is the nearest place they can buy a Mass card  Faith is something that should be cherished. I feel hugely grateful for having it in my le. I enjoy volunteering for my parish by the little bits and pieces I do to help. I am very grateful for the people around me who respect my faith, and those who share it with me. I suppose I still fear the Holy Joe label, because I know I’m far from a Holy Joe, but I suppose there are worse things I could be called. googletag.cmd.push Erin Hutcheon is PR and marketing officer with the North West Regional College.

I came up with an idea for an initiative to try to promote a more positive perspective for people at what feels like a very dark time for everyone. Its my suggestion that, while we remain in this time of social distancing, people place a set of Christmas lights in a front window of their home to promote a feeling of togetherness, mutual support and as a gesture of gratitude for all those who are out there still working to help all us through this dficult time.She believes this simple gesture could have a powerful effect, especially for children.At night when we look out and see the lights twinkling from our neighbours windows, well be reminded that were all in this together and united in our support for one another. It will also be symbolic of our hope and a reminder that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. googletag.cmd.push This message and initiative is particularly important for children who, while they seem to be relatively unaffected by this virus health-wise, can be massively affected by anxiety, both their own and that of the people around them.Ms Doherty has set up an instagram page Light Up Initiative where people have already been sharing pictures of their lit up windows. Its such an important message so Im encouraging everyone to continue share the light @lightupinitiative, she added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are publishing extracts from the book. In this latest article, Brian examines what the local area was like in the Bronze Age.   One Autumn’s day in  a local farmer ploughing his hill-top field, overlooking the River Foyle, hooked a large flat stone, of dimensions  feet by  feet, and brought it to the surface.There it remained while the winter’s frosts worked to break up the soil.It was members of Shantallow Local History Society, out searching for flint fragments, the evidence of prehistoric settlement, who on coming across this large flat stone realised it was perhaps the capping stone of a Bronze Age grave.The Archaeological Branch of the Department of the Environment was called in, who, on one very wet March day in , carried out an emergency dig.Small village What they found convinced them that here in the townland of Shantallow, on the fringe of the present-day city of Derry, in the early years of the second millennium BC, lived a small village community of farmers who had trade connections with the flint-mining areas of County Antrim, and who in a nearby cemetery buried their dead.The stone which had lain undisturbed for some , years was, in fact, the capping stone of a cist tomb.Around , BC a circular pit,  to  feet deep, had been dug on the brow of a small hill,  feet above the River Foyle.In the middle of this pit slabs of stone had been laid on edge to create a stone box,  feet long by  feet wide.The corpse, with his or her knees folded up to its chest, had been placed in this coffin on its side.Rotted awayOnly part of the skull and part of the leg bone remained of this skeleton, as the rest of the body had rotted away through contact with the soil.Behind the neck of the corpse was an earthenware pot in the shape of a bowl and decorated with jagged imprints.This bowl had been made specically for the burial ceremony.It is clear that these people believed in some form of afterle, as the bowl would have been filled with food or drink to sustain the body after death in the journey through the underworld.The cist in which the corpse lay was then roofed with a capstone. In this case, as occurred on other sites, the grave wasn’t marked above the ground with a mound of earth.The farmer had inadvertently uncovered on this hill-top site a Bronze Age cemetery.Short cistThis distinctive form of burial, in a short cist with an upright bowl-shaped food vessel, is not unique to Ireland.It has been found all over Europe, even as far east as Russia. It represents the spread of the so-called Beaker peoples, named after their pottery, who originated in lands around the mouth of the Rhine, then spread to Northern Britain and from there to Ireland. Around the early years of the second millennium they had reached Shantallow.These people were settled pastoralists who introduced metal-working into Ireland.Near the cist in Shantallow fragments of flint, which is not a native rock of this area, were found, and the area of their greatest concentration marked the spot where a small community lived.Shantallow clearly supported a Bronze Age village.The flints were fashioned to be used as arrowheads and thumbscrapers.The arrowheads would have been used in hunting while the thumb-shaped flint scrapers would have been used in the preparation of animal skins before they were cured.Clothes would have been made from this leather.No metal artefacts were found, but in other cist burials hundreds of metal implements have been found.Ireland possessed abundant supplies of copper, and these people exploited in a large way Irish copper and gold, as evidenced by the metal axes, knives and daggers they left behind.Their most outstanding personal ornament was the sheet-gold lanula, a crescent-shaped neck ornament.The settlers at Shantallow were primarily livestock farmers.With their metal axes they would have begun to clear some of the surrounding forest to expose good pasture land. Here cattle were grazed for their beef.They would also have grown wheat, oats and barley, with the grain being ground on saddle-querns.Within an earth enclosure, perhaps topped with a palisade of timber stakes, the early inhabitants of Shantallow would have lived in small, single-room, circular wicker huts.Their houses were probably built of posts and wattle rods.Thin saplingsStrong posts were driven into the ground, and thin saplings of hazel, elm or ash were woven between them to form the walls. Then the walls were plastered with daub in which mud was mixed with straw.This mixture dried very hard to create a sturdy homestead.The roofs would have been thatched with straw or rushes obtained from marshy ground.Our early settlers at Shantallow would have only made a small impact on the forests which clothed this area.Only the hill top would have been cleared of wood.On a clear day, rising above the trees that swept down to the banks of the Foyle on both sides of the river, the early dwellers of Shantallow might have spotted, some two miles to the south-east across the river, smoke curling up from open hearths on Rough Island in Enagh Lough.FragmentsFinds of late Stone Age and Bronze Age pottery fragments on this island, lying almost in the middle of the lake, roughly circular in shape, with a diameter of  feet and now largely overgrown with trees and shrubs, identies this as a settlement site around the same time as the community of Shantallow were burying one of their members.This site on Enagh Lough, termed a crannog, was formed by a  of timber, overlain with a layer of packed stones almost  feet deep, being placed, timber by timber and stone by stone, on top of a marshy island created by glacial dumping during the last Ice Age.Bronze spearheads, flint flakes and abraded stones, worn away by man’s rubbing or scraping, attest to its settlement in prehistoric times.Around the edge of the crannog there may have been a defensive palisade of timber stakes with lighter branches of wattle woven in and out through them.Very similarThe houses inside, built of wicker, wattling and daub, and the lestyle would have been very similar to those at Shantallow.Barley, wheat and oat impressions found on the pottery fragments are evidence of the cultivation of these crops in fields around the shore of Enagh Lough.In addition to farming their own food, the inhabitants here exploited the fish and fowl associated with a small lake.No names or even exact dates can be identied against these Bronze Age settlers of the Derry area.But we do know that they did exist, and that they began man’s first tentative exploitation and alteration of the local environment. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We can still go out when we need to for groceries and the like, so there is no need to panic. Why not take the opportunity to binge on a few Netflix series . Our suggestions below arent necessarily suitable for younger viewers but will keep adults enthralled for sure. The Stranger Probably the top trending Netflix series so far this year and for good reason. Harlen Cobens latest creation shows a strange woman turn up in a British community to reveal the secrets of the inhabitants. The resultant human wrangling and mystery makes this one of those series where one more episode is never enough. The tying of those secrets together as the series unfolds reveals a lot more about the locals than they care to admit and uncovers a murky underbelly. This is a must-watch. googletag.cmd.push Marcella Anna Friel is exceptional in this Nordic-inspired British crime drama. She plays a run-ragged detective who finds herself central to the murder mysteries shes investigating. The edge-of-the-seat drama entailed in the unravelling of the story in each of the two stories is truly gripping. This is a well-acted and produced ITV drama that might have slipped under the radar for many. With two series and  episodes available on Netflix, there is plenty to binge on. Unforgotten Another ITV production starring the brilliant Nicola Walker. This series sees a team of detectives re-opening cold cases following the discovery of new information. They endeavour to reach back in time and across generations to dig up old evidence and connections. The result is another brilliantly gripping drama with a new story taking centre stage in each of the two series available on Netflix. It is fast-paced and written in a way that puts you in the investigation room, often shouting at the TV with nuggets of information youve spotted in previous episodes. A third series has aired but has not yet reached the streaming service. googletag.cmd.push Safe Another Harlen Coben creation which has seen an increase in traffic since the success of The Stranger, although Safe appeared on Netflix first last year. Coben specialises in writing a big story within the context of a small community and this is the ultimate example. A teenage girl goes missing from her home in a gated community, and her fathers desperate search brings him into a dark world. Suspicion falls on almost everyone and this series will have you second-guessing every word out of every characters mouth. The Trials Of Gabriel Fernandez This true-crime documentary is perhaps the most disturbing of these suggestions but is compelling viewing. It charts the story of nine-year-old Gabriel Fernandez and his gruesome death at the hands of his mother and her partner. The abuse he suffered sparks a wide-ranging investigation. That investigation and this series shines a light on something far more sinister and systematic than the abuse in Gabriels own home. It will make you feel very uneasy but you will not be able to stop watching, wide-eyed with shock.

Blade Runner A truly classic science fiction filmdirected byRidley Scott and starringHarrison Ford,Rutger HauerandSean Young. The Crying Game Neil Jordan’s  hit was a success at the time and it boasts one of the most surprising twists in the tail in any film. googletag.cmd.push GoodFellas Martin Scorsese’s  masterpiece is a must watch film about the Mafia with an all star cast including Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro. GroundhogDay A brilliant  comedy where Bill Murray relives the same day over and over again.... Funny and fitting for the situation we find ourselves in. Jaws A classic and the music alone makes it worth watching. The Silence of the Lambs Not one for the kids.... and probably not one for some adults either. T Four Weddings and a Funeral A rom-com starring Hugh Grant and a theme song that launched a thousand first dances at weddings. googletag.cmd.push When Harry Met Sally Famous for THAT scene and a cracking comedy all round The Le of Brian Once banned in this country, it is still hilarious to this day and signs off with a tune fitting for the times we are in now.

Seven years later, he would be the first Maghera senior footballer to lt silverware after their MacLarnon Cup win over Omagh CBS. Back to back Ulster minor winner Laverty played on the Derry senior team of the mid-s, picking up two senior medals. His first cousin and godfather Colm Mulholland, who turned  in December played for Derry in the  All-Ireland final. Lavertys Derry senior debut came by chance. Jim McGuigan was organising the transport to Sligo for the opening game of the pre-Christmas section of the   league. googletag.cmd.push He asked Lavertyhe wanted to go to the game on the bus, just to watch. After all the ious pick up points passed, there were only  players on board, including Anthony McGurk who was nursing a sore ankle. “Do you want to play,” McGuigan asked in the direction of Laverty. Before he had a chance to reply, manager Paddy OHara told McGuigan to get him togs and socks a pair of boots from somewhere. “So there I was playing my first game. I remember the game was moved to Tobercurry, because of a waterlogged pitch. We won the game and remember Michael Kearns was playing for Sligo.” googletag.cmd.push It would be a further four years before he would make his championship debut. During that time, as a student at St Joes in Belfast, he won an All-Ireland Fresher medal and three Ryan Cupmedals. Regrettably, despite having a team capable of winning the Sigerson, the Ranch werent permitted to enter. With his native Lavey, he played for over  years, winning two championships, but for the last  years he calls Portrush his home. Every day, he will walk down the Coleraine Road to the shop, passing back over from County Antrim to his native Derry. He will pass the home of John Eddie Mullan, a league winner with the Oakleafers in , and the pair would often chat. Last week, when Lavertys phone rang and the opportunity arose to rake up the memories of  again, there was an excitement in his voice. Last year he had the thyear gathering of the  minor winning team that were defeated by Cork in All-Ireland final. “Brendan Kelly, Mickey Moran, Vincent Conway, Frankie McCotter and myself were on that team,” Laverty remembers. “The MacLarnon Cup final was a really good game of football compared to the MacRory which was dour and not very interesting.” Martin ONeill, who would later that year play alongside Laverty for Derry minors, played on the winning St Malachys team, managed by Phil Stuart, that lted the MacRory Cup. “Hugh Cudden, our goalkeeper, is now in Canada and Liam Harbinson is away in South Africa or Zimbabwe and Frankie McCotter lives in London.” Laverty scored one goal in the final with Harbinson, who played some Irish league soccer, notching the other, after dribbling clear of Omagh defence. “Liam is a relation of Sean OConnell and had a swagger like Sean OConnell. He was a very good soccer player, as was Mickey Moran. Playing in the school playground, you would know they had a bit of skill from soccer about them.” In those days, as Laverty remembers, organised games against other schools didnt come into vogue until third or fourth year. “What struck out for me, when we started in St Pats Maghera, there was only  pupils at it. We went into the assembly hall, there was no floor in it, we were standing on the grass as the school wasnt totally finished. “Frankie Kearney and Brian McKevitt took us in the early years. Then we had Sean Murphy and Eamon Small coaching us as well.” There were few highlights of the football in the early years but soon there was a greater enthusiasm and more boys were taking an interest. Frankie Kearney left the staff, going to St Pauls Kilrea. McKevitt went back to teach in the Abbey. Sean Murphy, with Jim B Bradley assisting him, took over the running of the senior team. “It was brilliant,” enthuses Laverty. “We were the first senior team and got Maghera into the MacRory. Adrian Boyle was still at Maghera the following year and remembers playing in the MacRory. “It was a fantastic feeling to win it and Omagh had a great team at that time. It was a ding dong game. We had a good team and were all very determined to win on that day.” Laverty was the captain and refers to manager Sean Murphys qualities in the classroom being transferred to the dressing room. “He was a good teacher and then he was a good manager as well. Everybody wanted to play for him. He had a good way of getting things across and he was a good motivator, you wanted to play for him.” Another ingredient for success, which Laverty mentions, was the school basketball team. Under the watch of Charlie Murphy, they won the Ulster title, with a - win over Methody. “It was up in San Souci Park, in Queens,” he adds, with the details floating down the phone-line asit were yesterday. There was a hiccup before the final. Maghera didnt have numbers on their vests and wouldnt be allowed to compete until a local intervention saved the day. St Colms Draperstowns U team were there and coach Seamus Kelly, loaned them their vests. Kelly, who passed away recently, would have an influence on Lavertys Derry career under Frankie Kearneys tenure. “Seamus was a shrewd man and was one of the mentors of Derry teams of ,  and . Sean OConnell would have been helping out with training – while still playing – and big Liam Hinphey was the motivator. Seamus Kelly was the tactician, he was very quiet but was shrewd operator.” “Methody came out in silk tops and togs, with all their fancy numbers. The vests we got were as tight as a fiddle string and too small for us. “There was a Methody boy who got a few tackles that day, that werent part of basketball, but thats another story,” added Laverty, with a hearty laugh. On the basketball starting team of five, were Mickey Moran and Eugene Laverty. Tommy McCloy of Lavey was another footballer but would leave school before the MacLarnon winning season. Also at the school during that era was current Lavey man Paddy Shivers, who went on to play for Derry as well. Laverty cant understand why Shivers wasnt on the Maghera team at that time. “I wasnt good enough,” Shivers has recently told Laverty. “He was a good footballer. He coached the team and played on the Lavey team for years. He was a PE teacher up in St Colms in Draperstown, took teams and did very well.” Laverty never forgot Shivers. He knew his footballers and, especially, a midfielder when he saw one. Winning captains names will continue to go up on the walls of St Patricks Maghera, but Eugene Laverty will always be the first.

From today, Sunday, March , there will be no left turn entry into the site.

Just last week, the Judges Road club were preparing for their All-Ireland League game with Sundays Well, hoping for a win which would take them away from relegation uncertainty and into a potential play-off position near the top of Division C. But the worldwide events of the past few days have not only ended sport locally, nationally and beyond, it has also put any game into context, with peoples lives at risk because of the spread of the Covid- virus.Rather than sit around and wait for the latest news however, City of Derry Head Coach Paul OKane, his staff and his players have made a public offer to go out into the community to help in anyway needed. OKane himself has already been out delivering groceries and prescriptions to the most vulnerable unable to travel in a bid to keep them safe during these uncertain times. “Its just something that we thought we would like to do,” he explained. “I spoke with the president and I spoke with the vice-chair of rugby, and there have been plenty of the players who have stuck their hands up. Were all at a bit of a loose end now and we know that theres vulnerable people out there and to be honest theres been a very good response. “Its certainly opened my eyes to how vulnerable in particular the old people are, even for simple things such as getting their shopping done or getting their prescriptions done and weve been out and about getting a few things done today. I think its just important we try and do something.”The importance of sport to the local community has never been more evident than in recent days with most sporting events and clubs taking a necessary step backwards. Sport however, can still give back, according to OKane.“Were really an extended family when you see how far and wide it reaches and people maybe dont realise that sometimes because were so erse,” he continued. “Were here for the whole community, were cross community, were cross-border and we have people involved in the club travelling from everywhere. “Its just important to try and help anyone we can, eventheyre not attached to the club, eventheyre just a part of the city or wider area. “We have players from Inishowen, Letterkenny, Strabane and Limavady, and from both sides of the water in Derry itself. We have footprints on every side of the community here. This is the least we can do for the wider rugby family in the city and the city in general.”It could be weeks or even months before the sporting calendar resumes, but in the meantime, OKane is hoping that the crisis will bring out the best of our community.“Its not just rugby because Im a Derry City fan and I try to get to every game I can,” he said. “Im from a gaelic background as well. I helped coach Doire Colmcille and Im originally a Limavady Wolfhound, so its great to see all those wee communities trying to do their bit, and were a part of that. “Were at a bit of a loss at what we do at the minute so we have to try and make the best of it and help whoever needs help and try to rally around. From a sporting point of view, you dont know what you have until youve lost it. “Its crazy how much it affects us, evenits sitting watching sport or going training. Some of the guys are going out of their mind because they cant train. Its been massively impactful and when we get back at it, I think we will appreciate things a lot more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Our priority is protecting our people and saving lives, which is paramount. As an Executive, we are doing everything we can and will continue to do so in the days, weeks and months ahead but we all have a role to play to protect ourselves and others from Covid-.The Executive has also paid tribute to health service staff who are performing ldquoheroically during this unprecedented time.Mr Swann said the entire health service is under growing pressure and appealed to people not to add to it unless they had to.ldquoPlease, please be patient and treat our great staff with respect, said the health minister. ldquoThey are there to care for you you are their first concern. Please show them the same concern and consideration.The Executive has also taken the opportunity to urge the public to follow the public health advice which means continuing to wash hands regularly for at least  seconds and anyone with mild symptoms should stay at home they will not need to be tested.People are asked not to contact or go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or emergency department.

St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only.

Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational.

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our

car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who

This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out.

Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott. Once on to the open mountain section, Lynch showed his climbing ability with a one minute lead at the summit before descending with devastating effect, leaving the opposition in his wake and an easy run home along the river bank.The rest of the field swapped places as everyone fought for grip on the steep mountain side.In the ladiesrsquo race it was Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson who dominated, showing many a good fell runner a clean pair of heels on the descent.At the end of the track back along the river it was Lynch, well in the lead taking his fourth win and third in a row in :, Scott held his position for second in : closely followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Adam Cunningham in :.Making the top ten for NAC were David Hicks in seventh place in : and Gary McEvoy ninth in :. Also running for NAC was Stevie Rice, finishing in : for th place. The ladiesrsquo race was won by Dickson for the fourth time in a row in : followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Karalee McBride in : and third was Ballydrain Harriersrsquo Alison Stocks in :.Following on from last weekendrsquos Slieve Gullion race, Newcastle AC again won the team prize.The silly boy award this week went to Hicks, who very nearly wasnrsquot allowed to start the race, having turned up without his mandatory safety kit bag.His only excuse was: ldquoOn ing from injury and a year out, Irsquom just getting back into the swing of things.Fortunately, a quick scramble around the start area saw him beg and borrow enough gear to be allowed to start the race. A big thanks has to go to our driver, Ciara Coffey, who finished seventh lady in ::, and co-pilot Dickson.With these two women at the helm what could possibly go wrong  All that can be said is that it was a good job the mountain foggy today and navigation skills werenrsquot required.With all the uncertainty about future races over the coming weeks, all runners are advised to check the NIMRA and race web pages before travelling..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Lockdown.jpg","title":"LOCKDOWN  ","story":"ALL Newry, Mourne and Down Council buildings across the district have been placed in lockdown for two weeks as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.The unprecedented decision mdash which will be reviewed at the end of the month mdash applies to the local authorityrsquos Downshire Civic Centre headquarters in Downpatrick, Down Arts Centre, Down County Museum, Down Leisure Centre and all other leisure and community centres across the entire district.Councillors unanimously agreed the move at an emergency council meeting on Monday night but are allowing limited public access to the Downshire Civic Centre in order for the public to submit planning and building control applications, register births, deaths and marriages.Staff who work at the ious council facilities which have been placed in lockdown will remain in place and continue to be paid, with politicians warning that the closure could potentially last for many months.All of the districtrsquos household recycling centres remain open and bin collections will continue as normal, with politicians insisting that the staff who deliver these particular services are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Council-owned parks, including Delamont outside Killyleagh, also remain open.The decision to close the doors of all council buildings to the public to help keep them safe and prevent the virus from spreading, came just days after councillors pulled the plug on yesterdayrsquos planned St Patrickrsquos Festival parade in Downpatrick.Mondayrsquos decision by councillors to close public buildings came in the wake of the virtual wipeout of the districtrsquos sports programme due to the virus, with all sports now suspended.

The Prime Minister said it was time to take ldquoradical action to stop the NHS being swamped with patients, with suggestions that people over  could be confined to their homes for months.At Mondayrsquos nightrsquos emergency council meeting, leisure centres were described as ldquohigh risk locations as people are in close proximity to one another, with politicians insisting that their key priority is to protect the public and staff.A number also criticised the mixed messages from both politicians and scientists on how to deal with the coronavirus and expressed concern that no decision had yet been taken to close all Northern Ireland schools.Confirming the closure of local authority public buildings, council officials say that access to the Downshire Civic Centre will be managed in line with Public Health Agency guidance.Council meetings will continue but with regard to new guidelines in relation to social distancing, they will not take place in debating chambers in Downpatrick and Newry as they do not have the required room to keep councillors apart.At the conclusion of Monday nightrsquos meeting, council officials confirmed that as its leisure and sports facilities will be closed, all lsquopaid in fullrsquo members will have their membership term extended to reflect the closure.In addition, all direct debit memberships will be suspended until further notice with collections scheduled for April  and  stopped.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll.

There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Fear and uncertainty is widespread throughout this community,” she said.“There will be a long term impact on the mental and economic health of the citizens of this City and Borough but the measures we have enacted so far are within the scope of our organisation.”Members then heard from the Chief Executive, Roger Wilson who reminded elected representatives of their duties in a time of crisis.“We are Council, we are the form of government closest to its citizens and, as civic leaders, we need to lead our community through this,” he said.“We are not the only people who have a role in this but we need to make sure we are all pulling in the one direction.“Many people are scared and are looking for information. Speaking to many of you, I know that you are being inundated by people looking for help and I would seek members approval to make decisions quickly as things are moving at a very fast pace.“There willbe a big impact on our communities mental well being and health and that is a challenge we will all have to face. We need to accept that and find a way to support our community.”The motion to support Council’s ongoing approach to thecoronavirus situation was proposed by Councillor Paul Berry and seconded by Councillor Sam Nicholson.Speaking after the motion was passed Sinn Fein’s Catherine Nelson thanked Council staff and officials for their tireless work and implored Council to consider using its cash reserves to help the local community through this crisis.“The rule book goes out the window at a time like this,” she said on behalf of her party.“Big decisions will need to be made and time will be no friend of ours. We give the Chief Executive and senior management team our full support. We have trust and faith in you.“I would ask for an imaginative and exhaustive approach. We don’t have to try and reinvent the wheel but we should be mindful of the mental health of our citizens and think about what we can do to help them.“We should think of walks, the appropriate use of our open spaces, drive in cinemas and even the use of our reserve fund to help those in need.“We talk about saving the reserves for a rainy day, we will never get a rainier day than what we are about to experience.”Her sentiments were echoed by independent Councillor Paul Berry who also urged Council to do what it could to keep businesses informed.“I would request that the information is kept flowing daily,not hourly because the message from businesses is clear, very few of them have more than a very short space of time to go.“Urgent intervention is required as we speak.It is important we try and keep SMEs and large businesses up to date on a daily basis to encourage them to try and hang in there.”The Ulster Unionist Party’s Julie Flaherty also urged Council to unite for the good of the community.“This is a time when we need to come together like never before,” she said.“We need to maximise the community response. We also want to extend our thanks to the Chief Executive and senior officials. You have our full support and we will strive to keep people informed.“The impact of this will be felt in our communityfor a long time and the UUP, along with this council, will be at the forefront of this issue.”The Alliance Party’s Peter Lavery also outlined his party’s support for the Chief Executive and said now is the time to set aside political dferences in order to protect le.“We look forward to hearing how we can help support local businesses,” said Cllr Lavery.“Council will play a strong role in lobbying central government on behalf of our community and we all know this situation will get worse before it gets better.“We must do all we can to support our community.”Democratic Unionist Party colleagues, DarrynCausby and Steven Moutray also extendedtheir appreciation to the Chief Executive, senior management team and all Council staff for their efforts.“Thistsunami is sweeping across the world and it will have a negative effect on our businesses,” said Cllr Moutray.“We need to know what we can do to help them and we, as councillors, will ensure that everyone is made aware of the help on offer.”Cllr Causby commended Cllr Nelson for her suggestion on using Council funds.“I would like to say that the idea of a community fund already mentioned by Catherine Nelson is something we should look at going forward,” he said.“As we move forward in this very dficult environment, we will work as best we can to take the dficult decisionsand provide support to those who need it.”The SDLP’s Thomas O’Hanlon also thanked the Chief Executive and the senior managementteam but warned that bigger decisions would need to be made in the near future.“Our community face very dficult times, they are scared and frightened, just as we all are.None of us are medical experts but it is a civic leaders duty to be calm and measured and ensure we respond with compassion.“We will get through this. Roger, you have made timely decisions so far and you will have more to make but you have our support.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most
