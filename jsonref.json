First we will spread the worst of the extra costs of this year\u0027s energy price shock over time. This year all domestic electricity customers will receive an up front discount on their bills worth £200.\u0027Energy suppliers will apply the discount on people\u0027s bills from October with the Government meeting the cost in full, that discount will automatically be repaid from people\u0027s bills in equal £40 instalments over the next five years.\u0027 Alarmingly many members of the Monetary Policy Committee pushed for a bigger rates increase to 0.75 per cent. Investors are anticipating the level will reach 1.5 per cent by the end of the year.Governor Andrew Bailey said it had been a \u0027close call\u0027 but stressed there was only likely to be \u0027modest\u0027 further increases in the coming months.He said the Bank had not acted because the economy is \u0027roaring away\u0027, but to counter the risk that inflation is becoming \u0027ingrained\u0027 domestically. The new peak is two percentage points higher than was forecast in November. Experts are warning the cost-of-living crisis could last years, with ministers hitting the panic button amid fears it will be even more toxic to the government than Partygate.Mr Sunak told MPs: \u0027The price cap has meant that the impact of soaring gas prices has so far fallen predominantly on energy companies, so much so that some suppliers who could not afford to meet those extra costs have gone out of business as a result.\u0027It is not sustainable to keep holding the price of energy artificially low. For me to stand here and pretend we don\u0027t have to adjust to paying higher prices would be wrong and dishonest.\u0027But what we can do is take the sting out of a significant price shock for millions of families by making sure the increase in prices is smaller initially and spread over a longer period.\u0027He added: \u0027Without Government intervention the increase in the price cap would leave the average household having to find an extra £693, the actions I\u0027m announcing today will provide to the vast majority of households just over half of that amount, £350.\u0027 The Ofgem move is likely to impact 22million households across Great Britain, and applies to those who are on their energy supplier\u0027s default tariff.\u0027We know this rise will be extremely worrying for many people, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet, and Ofgem will ensure energy companies support their customers in any way they can,\u0027 the watchdog\u0027s chief executive Jonathan Brearley said.\u0027The energy market has faced a huge challenge due to the unprecedented increase in global gas prices, a once in a 30-year event, and Ofgem\u0027s role as energy regulator is to ensure that, under the price cap, energy companies can only charge a fair price based on the true cost of supplying electricity and gas.\u0027 Meanwhile, Labour has renewed its demand for a windfall tax on energy companies after Shell recorded an eye-watering £12billion profit in just three months. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8491a1afd4c97a35520fb9f0ad9dab516a8ebcd4/0_5_6700_4019/master/6700.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=306f64c1ef8c051868a7a5d65d678391","title":"bp profits surge energy crunch softbank arm ofgem stock markets business live","story":"But growth in the second half of last year was held back by the “well documented shortages of labour in the UK retail industry”, Ocado says. A fire at its fulfilment centre in Erith, south-east London also temporarily hit capacity, and led to some others being cancelled. Tim Steiner, CEO of Ocado Group, said: Ocado made a pre-tax loss of £176.9m for last year, and also warned that core earnings in 2022 would fall short of market expectations as it steps up investment. A strong financial performance from SSE’s gas-fired power ision more than made up for a steep drop in output from its wind power business, which suffered from weak wind speeds across Europe in recent months. Last November, National Grid launched a review of this balancing market, saying there had been some very high-cost days costs which are ultimately borne by consumers. SSE now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be at least 90p, up from at least 83p forecast in November. BP made almost $2.7bn of pre-tax profits from its stake in the Kremlin-controlled Rosneft during 2021, today’s results show, compared with a loss of $238m in 2020. On an underlying basis, profits from Rosneft were $2,451m last year, up from just $53m in 2020. BP says this recovery is due to higher oil prices and favourable foreign exchange effects during last year. This chart shows the details: In the last quarter alone, BP’s Rosneft stake provided $745m of underlying replacement cost profits before interest and tax, out of total underlying pre-tax RC profits of $7.049bn (or just over $4bn after tax in October-December). The bumper annual results were boosted by a $4.1bn profit in the final quarter of 2021, as global gas demand recovered and oil prices rallied to seven-year highs.  Annual profits compared with a $5.7bn loss in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reduced demand for energy. Natural gas and electricity prices have soared since last summer on tight gas supplies and rising demand as economies bounced back from the pandemic, with the stand-off between Russia and Ukraine also pushing gas prices higher. BP’s results prompted fresh calls for a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to fund extra help for hard-hit households braced for a sharp rise in energy bills and wider cost of living crisis. Last week, BP’s rival, Shell, reported a quadrupling of 2021 profits to $19.3bn. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor and MP for Leeds West, tweeted:  Here’s the full story: “We need to be encouraging investment in natural gas in Britain, not discouraging,” Looney told Reuters.Shareholders will also welcome the news that BP will buy back $1.5bn of shares this quarter using its surplus cash, taking its total buybacks for 2021 to $4.15bn (see earlier post). Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says BP is clearly making progress: That will fund $4.15bn of share buybacks for last year (a way of passing earnings onto investors), with BP announcing it will buy $1.5bn of shares in the first quarter of this year from 2021 surplus cash flow.  Brent crude is currently trading at $92 per barrel, close to yesterday’s seven-year high, up from around $50 per barrel at the start of 2021.In the outlook section of its financial results, BP says: Europe entered this winter with its lowest reserves of gas in at least 10 years. The UK has some of the continent’s lowest gas storage capacity, having clsoed its main gas storage site off the east coast in 2017. BP has reported a surge in profits as the oil giant cashes in on the jump in oil and gas prices which are fuelling the cost of living crisis. BP made an underlying replacement cost (RC) profit, its preferred earnings measure, of $4.065bn (£3bn) in the last three months of 2021 alone, up from $3.322bn in July-September. That’s almost 35 times the $115m RC profit which BP reported in Q4 2020, when the pandemic was hitting energy demand. BP says its underlying replacement cost profit improved as a result of higher oil and gas prices and refining margins and stronger trading results.  For the full year, BP made underlying profits of $12.8bn, or £9.5bn, as it bounced back from a loss of $5.7bn in 2020 (when the pandemic hit demand and it wrote off billions of assets). Profit attributable to bp shareholders came in at $7.565bn for 2021, up from a $20.3bn loss in 2020. BP’s results are certain to intensify calls for energy companies to face windfall taxes to help cover the impact of rising energy bills on households. Last November, Bernard Looney, BP’s CEO described the company as a “cash machine” after soaring oil and gas prices boosted profits. Later this morning MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee will question Jonathan Brearley, CEO of regulator Ofgem, on the energy price cap, and the impact it has on household energy bills. The other big news of the morning is that SoftBank’s sale of UK-based chip designer Arm to Nvidia has collapsed, after regulators in the UK, the United States and Europe raised serious concerns that the “largest semiconductor chip merger in history” would hurt competition. The two sides agreed to terminate the deal because of “significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction, despite good faith efforts by the parties,” SoftBank said in a statement (via Bloomberg). Softbank is now aiming to float Cambridge-based Arm on a stock market. The failure of the deal is a major setback to the Japanese conglomerate’s efforts to generate funds, at time when valuations across its portfolio are under pressure.  Arm also announced that Rene Haas, head of the company’s intellectual property unit, will become its chief executive, succeeding Simon Segars. Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp, said in a statement: "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8f5234d2b9a329885d5cc8d05d2504cd706bdee/0_233_1666_1000/master/1666.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=66cb5e3ab906c28c9683f75864473d43","title":"weekend episode one of a new podcast","story":"In our first episode, Marina Hyde reflects on another less than stellar week for Boris Johnson (1m38s), Edward Helmore charts the rise of Joe Rogan (9m46s), Laura Snapes goes deep with singer George Ezra (18m30s), and Alex Moshakis asks, “Are you a jerk at work?” (34m40s).If you like what you hear, subscribe to Weekend on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51068620cf0bb552034b62d6cb8d9d35c4001d8a/0_274_4352_2613/master/4352.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=291b5c9df56c1f70f67a3208f671563e","title":"winter olympics 2022 day four beijing usa canada ice hockey super giant slalom updates","story":"“I didn’t want it to end,” Carrillo said. “I wanted to keep skating and living the Olympic dream.” Carrillo said he was so excited when he landed his first jump, a quad toe loop, that he had to tell himself to refocus in order to finish his routine. He also pulled off his difficult triple axel, though he was penalised for a triple lutz-triple toe when he took an extra step, but that turned out to be the only real blemish in an otherwise strong program. “I was super happy,” Carrillo said of his opening jumping pass. “I tried to calm a little bit because I had the whole program.” Carrillo showed off his national pride throughout his performance, which was set to music by the band Santana. His blade covers displayed the green, white and red colors of the Mexican flag, and he wore a sparkly black and gold costume custom-made by Mexican fashion designer Edgar Lozzano, who offered it to Carrillo for free. (AP) Quentin Fillon Maillet (France) takes gold, Anton Smolski (Belarus) silver and the defending champion, Johannes Thinges Boe of Norway, takes bronze. The sun is setting in Hualindong, and it’s a pretty parky -11C at the biathlon venue right now. Before this match, Japan topped the group with seven points from two matches, Czech Republic sit second with six points. The wait for Britain’s first gold medal at these Winter Olympics goes on, but Team GB has become a surprise success off the snow and ice after its opening ceremony kit became a sensation on Weibo, the most widely used social media platform in China. Reaction to the British team, who wore a Ben Sherman duffle coat and Chelsea boots during the ceremony, reached No 8 on the Weibo Hot Topic section, with the Olympics and the start of the Chinese lunar new year the most popular. Tsevetkov takes off his skis, and crashes to the snow in exhaustion. Boe is right there, too, but the two athletes don’t acknowledge each other.A story from last night, on the chaos that unfolded at the ski jumping yesterday: Ryan Cochran-Siegle of the United States won a shock silver medal, finishing 0.04 seconds behind in second. World Cup super-G leader Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway was 0.42 behind in third. San Francisco-born Eileen Gu, who lifted the host country to the top of the medals table at the Beijing Olympics with a freeski Big Air gold on Tuesday, remained evasive on whether she was still holding an American passport. China does not allow dual nationality, and state media have previously reported that the 18-year-old renounced her US citizenship after she became a Chinese national at the age of 15. Gu would not confirm that on Tuesday.  Less than 24 hours after their gold medal dreams were snatched away in a final stone loss to Norway, Dodds and Mouat were unable to recover after going 4-1 down in the second end and lost 9-3. Before I pass the baton to Luke McLaughlin in sunny England, we’re about to go cross country skiing, before we don our rifles and head over to the men’s 20km Biathlon. Just wrapping up, Canada prevailed 4-2 over the United States in the Women’s Hockey in what will surely be the gold medal game, while Great Britain’s mixed doubles curlers met their match in the clinical, ruthless Swedes. Over to you Luke!They move quickly in the snowboarding competition! Ester Ledecka takes on Daniela Ubling in the women’s comp, while Austria’s Benjamin Karl tackles Slovenia’s Tim Mastak in the men’s. It’s all over in the mixed doubles, with the respective pairs shaking hands and the Swedes taking Bronze. Bruce Mouat and Jennifer Dodds had a great few days but the Swedes got the jump on them early and never looked back.  The Czech star has had two runs today, and both her opponents have come a cropper, with Poland’s Aleksandra Krol falling in the quarter finals. We’re now onto the men’s quarters. We’re on the 6th End, and the Swedes are having a complete lend. Oscar Eriksson, in particular, is in fine fettle. They’ve all but sown up the Bronze. ICYMI, Nathan Chen put on a clinic earlier  The Swedish pair are pitiless. The Power Play will kick off the second half. To the uninitiated, this is such a great sport to watch. It’s one-on-one, with plenty of mind games and technical brilliance. Ester Ledecka was safely through in the women’s quarters and now we’re on to the fellas. Russia’s Dmiitri Loginov has just been rolled and is Loginout of these Olympics. ’s take on the extraordinary Eileen Gu, one of the genuine superstars of these Games.  A steal of three to the pesky Swedes. ‘Shop Early’ as they say in Curling circles.  The second snowboarding medal event is now underway, with the men’s and women’s events running simultaneously, and the final being decided just two hours after qualifying. Ester Ledecka is the reigning champ and the hottest of favourites in the women’s event. She was the first athlete to compete in alpine skiing and snowboarding at an Olympics. She was also the first woman to win gold in two different disciplines at a Winter Olympics. This is her pet event. She was two seconds clear of anyone else in qualifying and appears to have a mortgage on the gold. Her stiffest competition is expected to come from Ramona Therasia Hosmeister (Germany), Daniela Ubling (Austria) and Ladina Jenny (Switzerland).  In the men’s competition, South Korea’s Lee Sangho was the fastest qualifier, while 22-year-old Russian Dmitri Loginov is looking to become the youngest man to win a medal in alpine snowboarding. I’ll be Loginov myself in about two hours. Sorry. To snare gold, he’ll have to top Benkamin Karl (Austria), Nevin Galmarini (Switzerland) and Zan Kosit (Slovenia).I have cursed the Brits. Half a second after pressing ‘go’ on that last update, the Swedes say ‘stuff you’ and unleash a 4 pointer! Thanks Beau, let’s kick off with some Curling, traditionally not my strong suit, but a crucial match nonetheless. At one point, the Brits were 4-2 the better of the husband and wife Norwegian pair. But Norway’s Kristin Skaslien had ice in her veins, and secured a berth in the big one. They’ll take on Italy, who gave Sweden a hiding, winning 8-1. Early in proceedings, the Brits are up 1-0 but the Swedes have conditions to suit (so I’m assured).But you have to wonder if Ann Marie Desbiens and the shot-blocking Canadian defense are in the USA’s heads now. Desbiens made 51 saves. Someone surely counted the number of blocks, and it’ll be equally staggering.  And on that note -- all yours, Jonathan. Good night from the USA.Sandra Weingart: “Cranky person is wrong. Quip away, especially if it’s snarky. Yes, I was watching Nathan Chen and the wonderful Jason Brown, who is extremely unlikely to medal but skates so beautifully, but its only 11 pm in the Mountain Time Zone and 10 out on the left coast, so the western half of America is still awake.” Jason Brown’s program was beautiful. Without quads, he won’t medal, but he’s fun to watch. Barbara Roden: “Cute quips’? Love them keep them coming! We Canucks take our hockey a bit too seriously sometimes, and it’s fun to read something that doesn’t treat every international game involving a Canadian hockey team as if we’re at mission control trying to get Apollo 13 back to Earth safely.” You should see what happens on US soccer Twitter when the men lose. (When the women lose, it’s always someone else’s fault or bad luck.) 2:40 left. Time to pull the goalie?Still the same story -- plenty of US possession, no goal. 4:00 left.The USA has outshot Canada 50-25. They’ve taken only two penalty minutes to Canada’s 10. And it’s still 4-2 Canada with 6:02 left.

A recent study led by Oxford academics, which found that up to a third of people found positive on a PCR test were not contagious, should give the Government cause to reconsider the wisdom of this approach.At an inidual level, knowing your own infection status can be extremely helpful, for example if you are planning to visit a vulnerable relative or friend. However, as we all know, a positive test result can have significant negative impacts, particularly if it entails loss of income and opportunity. If the tests are too sensitive, the problem is even worse.Furthermore, the truth is that we are permanently crawling with germs. Expecting the inidual to bear responsibility for any infection that he or she might pass on risks leaving us all living in a state of permanent guilt. Normally, this guilt is dispersed within the community.This is not to say that, during a pandemic, we should not exercise care to protect the vulnerable by limiting contact with them while we are infectious (in fact, I would highly recommend this) but it is also important to remember that once a disease has become endemic, there is little else we can do other than not visit granny when we have a fulminant cold.But to what extent should we self-isolate upon testing positive or being told that we may have been in contact with someone who tested positive? As we have witnessed over the past few months, these actions do little to stop the spread of infection and create enormous problems for the delivery of healthcare and education. Sanctioning the use of tests that suggest people are contagious even when they are not magnifies the problem.It is, however, important to recognise that things would not have been much different if we had a perfect test, as in some sense we now have with the new generation of LFDs. We would still have vast numbers of key workers unable to function and children being deprived of the safety and intellectual and emotional stimulation that our educational system seeks to provide. We would still have to endure life being endlessly disrupted – all having scant impact on the prevalence of an infection in its endemic state.Testing could have been profitably used at the population scale. Even imperfect measurements of the incidence of infection done randomly could have allowed us to make intelligent assessments regarding the progression of the pandemic and the effects of the restrictions, allowing greater flexibility and better tailoring advice to the vulnerable and the NHS.Some deficiencies in the rigour of testing early in the pandemic, given that we were dealing with an emergency, could be tolerated on the basis that it was important to garner information on the development of the situation. What cannot be forgiven is that, instead, we used a faulty testing scheme to transfer societal responsibilities to the inidual, sentencing many to loss of livelihood, education, social contact and hope – and we still are.Continuing with a mass testing, mass isolation strategy in response to a disease that has become endemic is merely piling up the misery. The Government must change course.Sunetra Gupta is professor of theoretical epidemiology at the Department of Zoology, University of OxfordMore from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39not to blame\u0026#39 for harassment of Sir Keir Starmer, minister saysRepublicans urged to stay out of Ottawa trucker protest as court bans horn honking Ukraine latest news: Putin moving towards de-escalation, say French officialsPolice rescue Sir Keir Starmer from mob who surround him and accuse him of \u0026#39protecting paedophiles\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"paraplegic man walks thanks electronic implant spine","story":"A completely paralysed man was able to walk again at the touch of a button after an electronic implant was placed in his spine in a groundbreaking operation.Italian Michel Roccati had no movement or feeling in his legs following a motorcycle accident in 2017 which severed the nerves in his spinal cord.However, after Swiss researchers implanted an electronic array, which stimulates the nerves below the injury, he was instantly able to stand and walk, and has since been able to cycle and swim.“The first few steps were incredible – a dream come true. It was very emotional to see my legs moving,” said the 30-year-old.“I’ve been through some pretty intense training in the past few months, and I’ve set myself a series of goals. For instance, I can now go up and down stairs, and I hope to be able to walk one kilometre by this spring.”Similar technology has been used to help patients with partial paralysis, but it is the first time it has been shown to work in people who had no movement at all.The implant was developed by scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) and Lausanne University Hospital, and works by stimulating the region of the spinal cord that activates specific muscle groups in the trunk and legs.The team needs at least six centimetres (2.4 inches) of healthy spinal cord below the injury so that the implant can stimulate certain nerves. It is fitted underneath the vertebrae, inside the spinal column. They then use artificial intelligence to discover the sequence of neurons which fire in iniduals when they want to carry out various activities, such as walking, cycling and even canoeing.At the moment, the implant uses just 16 electrodes to stimulate the nerves, but in time, the researchers want to move to 32 or 64 to gain even greater control.After the implant, patients need about 10 days of recovery, before the implant can be switched on. As well as Mr Roccati, it has been also trialled successfully on three other patients.Prof Gregoire Courtine, a neuroscientist from EPFL, said: “Our stimulation algorithms are based on imitating nature, and work exactly in the way that the spinal cord is stimulated by the brain. “When you first turn it on you can stand, and step but you still need support, and the gait pattern is poor, but it allows you to start training all this activity immediately, and over the course of several months we can decrease the support.“All three patients were able to stand, walk, pedal, swim and control their torso movements in just one day, after their implants were activated. That’s thanks to the specific stimulation programs we wrote for each type of activity.“We are not yet at the stage where it’s a commercially available technology that you can use with your smartphone, but that’s our next objective.”For Mr Roccati’s first attempt, two small remote controls were attached to a walker to help him support himself because years of inactivity meant his muscles were severely wasted. The remote controls were attached wirelessly to a tablet which forwards the correct signals to a pacemaker in his abdomen. That pacemaker then relays the signals to the implant which stimulates specific neurons in a specific sequence, allowing the muscles to fire up in the correct order.Mr Roccati underwent surgery for the implant last August and has been steadily improving ever since.He said: “I had an accident on a motorbike and I immediately understood there was something wrong. I tried to move my legs and saw it was impossible. But I fixed in my mind that it was a problem to be solved.“I was living with my parents, and now I have an apartment and I can do everything alone no problem.”Dr Jocelyne Bloch, a neurosurgeon at Lausanne University Hospital, added: “There are so many patients around the world who need a treatment to fight against paralysis.“This technology is so precise that immediately after the surgery, the patient can walk and stand. The electrodes are arranged in a way that corresponds exactly to the spinal nerve roots.“That gives us precise control over the neurons regulating specific muscles. Ultimately, it allows for greater selectivity and accuracy in controlling the motor sequences for a given activity.”While the progress achievable in a single day is groundbreaking, the gains after several months are even more impressive.The three patients were able to regain muscle mass, move around more independently, and take part in social activities like having a drink standing at a bar.The team is now working with Onward Medical, a medical technology company, to move the technology to a smartphone, so patients can simply select the activity they need.Larger clinical trials will be taking place in the US and Europe imminently, with the team hoping the device will be available within the next two to three years.Details of the research were published in the journal Nature Medicine.More from NewsRepublicans urged to stay out of Ottawa trucker protest as court bans horn honking Ukraine latest news: Putin moving towards de-escalation, say French officialsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39not to blame\u0026#39 for harassment of Sir Keir Starmer, minister saysPolice rescue Sir Keir Starmer from mob who surround him and accuse him of \u0026#39protecting paedophiles\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"obese get weight loss jabs effective gastric band","story":"Weight loss jabs that are as effective as a gastric band are to start being prescribed by the NHS. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) is expected to give the green light to Wegovy, a once-weekly injection that suppresses appetite.Trials have found that those put on the treatment lost an average of almost two-and-a-half stone, compared with those given a placebo.Researchers last year said the treatment was a “game-changer”, with results comparable to those of weight loss surgery. One-third of those taking part in the trial lost an average of a fifth of their total body weight. The new recommendations are expected to recommend the treatment to those with a body mass index of 30 or over if they have been referred for specialist help, and to anyone with a  BMI of 35 or more with a weight-related health problem. More than one in four people in the UK are obese, which means a BMI of 30 or over. Experts said the treatment, manufactured by Novo Nordisk, should be taken alongside changes in dietary habits and exercise habits. The drug works by hijacking the body\u0027s own appetite-regulating system in the brain, leading to reduced hunger and calorie intake. Research last year found that those put on the regime lost five times as much weight as those in the placebo group.When the results were published, Rachel Batterham, lead researcher for the project and professor of obesity, diabetes and endocrinology at University College London, said they were “a major breakthrough for improving the health of people with obesity”.“No other drug has come close to producing this level of weight loss - this really is a gamechanger,” she said. “For the first time, people can achieve through drugs what was only possible through weight-loss surgery.”Britain has some of the worst rates of obesity in the Western world, with two in three adults overweight or obese.Last week, NHS research found slimmers put on an NHS regime of soup and shakes to reverse diabetes have lost an average of two stone in just three months.More from NewsUkraine latest news: Kremlin denies promising Macron no new military exercises near Ukraine\u0026#39s borderPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39not to blame\u0026#39 for harassment of Sir Keir Starmer, minister saysRepublicans urged to stay out of Ottawa trucker protest as court bans horn honking Police rescue Sir Keir Starmer from mob who surround him and accuse him of \u0026#39protecting paedophiles\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"special advisors mustnt become special","story":"My first thought on last week’s resignation of Munira Mirza, the head of Boris Johnson’s Policy Unit, was that this was the worst blow so far in his current crisis. Ms Mirza is a brave, principled, straight-dealing person who has an unusual combination of strong intellectual powers and the ability to get things done. Far from being a rat leaving the sinking ship, she was a key figure in the engine room. Boris desperately needs such people near him.I still think that. But I think something else as well, which is that the public cult of the adviser has gone too far. At their best, the special advisers to prime ministers and other ministers, known as “Spads”, are invaluable – the ones at the top, such as Ms Mirza, even more so. They fight for their bosses against suffocation by officialdom and help manage their relationships with the media. Without them, it is hard to develop policy and drive through the central aims of any government.But, as a trainspotting friend informs me, the initials SPAD mean, in railway parlance, “Signal Passed At Danger”. That signal was passed in Tony Blair’s era by Alastair Campbell and, in Boris’s, by Dominic Cummings.However talented, advisers shine only with a “borrowed light”. Their duty is to advise their principal and otherwise to shut up. If their principal wants them out, they must go, without public complaint. If they wish to leave, they should do so, without publishing a letter about it attacking their boss (as Ms Mirza has just done). Nor should they wage war against their former boss forever after, as Mr Cummings does – even saying last year that his intention on coming into office under Boris Johnson had been to work to get Boris Johnson out.It is not relevant here whether their criticisms are right. I think Mr Cummings had a good understanding of Boris’s shortcomings and many good ideas for policy reform. I know that Ms Mirza was always fighting valiantly to improve the coherence of policy against Boris’s temptation to fuzz things up.No, the problem is two-fold. The first is a fact that should be obvious in any organisation – no one can run anything if hisher right to lead is not respected. That includes the right to make the wrong decisions. Advisers, by definition, do not decide. If they cannot accept that basic rule, they should not be doing their jobs.The second is a democratic one. Governments are formed as a result of elections, and largely composed of people whom voters elected. If unelected advisers are trying to run the show, or plotting to depose elected people, they are showing contempt for the voters. They are undermining the legitimacy of the entire system.Mr Cummings’s great Vote Leave slogan was “Take back control”. If he had said “Give me control” instead, the public would never have voted Leave.Something very strange is therefore coming about. One of the main purposes of advisers – particularly in a Conservative government against which Whitehall is biased – is supposed to be to take on the so-called “Blob” of bureaucrats and quangos. The advisers are put in to help break the stranglehold of unelected power. But if they are simply a different unelected power, attempting to gain a stranglehold of their own, what good is that to voters?The Blob and the anti-Blob may hate one another, but they come perilously close to the same thing – a conspiracy against the public.The announcement that the Duchess of Cornwall will become Queen Consort when her husband succeeds to the throne has been well handled.To coincide with her 70 years as monarch, the Queen has expressed this as her wish. Who can challenge her?Not for the first time, the Queen has picked the right moment. It reminds me of when, in 2018, she took advantage of the Commonwealth conference in London to persuade the assembled leaders that the Prince of Wales should be made Head of the Commonwealth on her death. They wanted to grant her wish.If it had been rushed, the decision about the Queen Consort could have caused an explosion. As Editor of this paper at the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, I remember how vehement many of our readers felt against the then Camilla Parker Bowles.Most of them were not such extreme members of the Diana camp that they wanted the Prince of Wales passed over in favour of Prince William but many were very upset at the way they felt Diana had been treated. Mrs Parker Bowles became the target of their wrath. They did not want her to benefit, as they saw it, from the breakup and the tragedy of Diana’s death.It was because of feelings such as these that, when the couple did eventually marry in 2005, she became only the Duchess of Cornwall, not the Princess of Wales. But, as so often happens with marital break-ups, the sense of taking sides sharply reduces over time. If the new partner politely plays it long, shehe is accepted.Thanks to Camilla’s good sense and good will, that has clearly happened. She will never become – to use Diana’s own phrase about herself – our “Queen of Hearts” and has never for a moment sought such a vainglorious role.All the more reason to think she will be a good Queen Consort.More from NewsRepublicans urged to stay out of Ottawa trucker protest as court bans horn honking Ukraine latest news: Putin moving towards de-escalation, say French officialsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39not to blame\u0026#39 for harassment of Sir Keir Starmer, minister saysPolice rescue Sir Keir Starmer from mob who surround him and accuse him of \u0026#39protecting paedophiles\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris rishi need good neighbours","story":"Neighbours, everybody needs good neighbours... but the Boris and Rishi fairytale is going to end in tearsDowning Street has found the perfect blend of bluster and billionaire, says Fleet Street Fox. But how long will Errorsboroughs marriage of convenience last Its the wedding of Rot and Brylcreem - a match made in hellopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsIf thereaposs one thing that Boris Johnson is disciplined about, itaposs control. Specically, not being subject to it. Wedding vows, lockdown rules, basic morality, the Ministerial Code, his own manesto: the default response of the Prime Minister to all of them is PAH! Which is why itaposs interesting that, a week after the worst week in his premiership since the previous worst week, which was only the week before, the PM is now submitting himself to the control of his Chancellor of the Exchequer.In a single weekend, Rishi Sunakaposs mates have moved into No, expensive policy announcements have been binned, and the crime of fraud which has taken £bn off the taxpayer on Covid alone has been downgraded to a harmless infraction of little consequence.  Unfortunately, this whirlwind romance is headed for some very big and pointy rocks.The first is that the cost of living crisis, which is already a crisis, is going to get worse with food costs predicted by millionaires to rise another % in April. No-one knows what to call something worse than a crisis, but the dictionary will probably need updating to include something like crisaster.The second is the energy crisis, in which the taxpayer has been forced to compensate corporate giants for not being able to steal money immediately, and instead letting them steal it over  years. Prices are likely to rise again in the autumn, and because  months was too long for billion-pound firms to wait, the government may allow an extra price rise in the summer to tide them over. Presumably, weaposll be calling this frobbery.If Boris thinks Her Upstairs is dficult to live with, heaposs going to flip when he finds out that Rishi is the sort of spouse whoaposll give him £ towards the housekeeping, and then ask for £ back by exerting some below-inflation fiscal drag on state pensions. On the face of it, their relationship is rooted in shared politics and a mutual love of money. But while one partner is a hedge funder whoaposs got more money than the Queen, the other never carries cash because he canapost hold onto it for more than  minutes.Both of them seem unable to spot a party when it involves  people, soft drinks, beer, renditions of Happy Birthday, a society wallpaperer, an official photographer, a strategically-sly cake, and a police investigation. Both, according to reports, are also capable of enjoying all that in the space of just  minutes before getting on with the job, which is a polite way of saying you burped all afternoon.But thereaposs little  these two have in common. One is a spender, the other a spaffer. One drinks beer, the other power. One is vain enough to arrange photocalls on staircases so he doesnapost look as short, while the other has just one suit and no comb. Read moreToday, weaposre told that a major announcement on Borisapos big promise to use the £bn National Insurance increase to bring down NHS waiting lists has been boiled down to a website, so that you can stop ringing the doctor to find out about your appointment and just throw the computer out of the window instead.Officially, the plan isnapost ready yet, and unofficially Rishiaposs blocking it until heaposs PM and can announce it himself. And therein lies the problem with this partnership: only last week, Johnsonaposs friends were telling him to kick Sunak out, on the grounds he was trying to steal his job.Imagine a bride trying to get the groom sacked, withholding cash while giving it to rich mates, giving Princess Diana eyes in TV interviews whenever sheaposs asked about parties. Picture a groom so desperate to keep the house that heaposll overlook their dferences, let her take total control, and start measuring up for curtains he will never get to see.Think about a relationship in that much trouble before its second anniversary. It might work in an Australian daytime soap, but it ainapost going to last in a world where people donapost come back from the dead after  years lost at sea. Johnson thinks heaposs saved his skin by ceding control to his most ambitious enemy, and boasts it would now take a Panzer ision to get him out of No. Sunak, meanwhile, is quietly lining up his tanks in the Downing Street garden, which he has always had a great view of from his No office. The PM is being infantilised by enemies saying his we wields all the power, and potentially criminalised by his friends claiming that she has nothing to do with his work, but nevertheless attended a lot of work events.And the only PR expert who can be persuaded to enter the fray is someone who considers the PM sexually incontinent, throws Benny Hill salutes at world leaders, quotes Gloria Gaynor, and on his first day gives the press the headline: Heaposs not a COMPLETE clown. But the fundamental flaw with this great reset, which is probably more of a breather to allow Rishi to liquidate assets, is that it involves trying to instil discipline in a man who has spent a letime shucking it. The fact he needs to be taught the self-control of a toddler is why he lives in Errorsborough - a town twinned with Débâcle.Fans may think these two have found the perfect blend of bluster and billionaire, but itaposll last only as long as it takes for Johnson to take back being out-of-control, and Sunak deciding that his tanks are ready to evict.

Speaking exclusively to the Mirror in Sunderland, he said: “They have seen we’ve changed. “People will either be very candid and say they felt the approach under the previous regime was that they just didn’t get business at all, or some will say they understood maybe where the motivations were coming from - they understood there’s not enough high-quality work in the UK, too much low-wage, low-skill work - but they just didn’t feel we were realistic in how we thought we could achieve that.Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter  “You’ve got to do that with a partnership with business. There’s no magic and to wave, it’s that framework you put in place. “It’s maybe not realistic to say you will put up taxes on businesses to such a high degree and then expect them to do the investment you want.”Industry chiefs could also be looking to Labour because of Boris Johnson ’s infamous “f*** business” rant, and as his Chancellor Rishi Sunak lts corporation tax from % to % - piling pressure on firms battling soaring energy prices, a national insurance hike and minimum wage rises. Business leaders were also spooked by the Prime Minister’s speech to the Confederation of British Industry last year, where he told guests about a recent day trip to Peppa Pig World.“People see Labour have changed, but so have the Tories,” said Mr Reynolds. “They like the change they have seen in us and they don’t like what they have seen in the Government.” He said business chiefs were put off by the PM’s “cavalier attitude” and “flippancy”. “This is a crucial time for business,” he said.  “There is this coming together this year with the national insurance tax rise, the energy price hike and inflation … it’s reasonable that they have a serious response from the PM - and they haven’t had that.” Admitting Labour had a responsibility to offer an alternative, he added: “People use our vision on the economy and relationship with business as a proxy of whether they see us as a viable government, on the whole.”Mr Reynolds, who was elected MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, Greater Manchester, in  and won a , majority at the  election, is working with party leader Keir Starmer, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Shadow Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband and Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden to develop an industrial strategy, which Labour hopes to unveil before its September conference.The blueprint will “be a basis for a conversation with businesses, unions and other stakeholders”, said Mr Reynolds, who wants to “re-industrialise” Britain.  He believes hailing from the North East gives him an insight into some of the biggest issues businesses face. “I know from growing up here - Labour politicians often go on about the past too much - but clearly the Miners’ Strike and the shipyard closures, no-one would say this was the strongest economy to grow up in,” he said. “If you want to do this job really well, whether you’re from a place like this, you have to understand the places like Sunderland and Tameside, where I have grown up and now have lived in my adult le, because you have to understand the story of the Industrial Revolution and how it shapes this country - particularly the Midlands and the North but then the challenges that come from the deindustrialisation of the s onwards.“That conversation has led to ‘leveling-up’ and Brexit and, for the first time, some of those places trying out the Conservative Party.“It couldn’t get more real as a background.  If Mr Reynolds succeeds in taking over at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, he could face an economy battered by a cost-of-living crisis, struggling to find the “unicorn” of greater productivity and dealing with the highest interest rates since before the  financial meltdown. He hopes to hear from successful firms what they want from ministers. Donning a cap and hi-vis, he toured the Nissan factory this week, seeing production lines for the Qashaqi, Juke and Leaf models. Like other UK carmakers, Nissan produced fewer cars last year than during the first year of the pandemic . Figures last week showed that in , Britainaposs car assembly plants produced just , vehicles - % down on the , made in . UK factories are producing a third fewer cars than in . Output at Nissan in Sunderland, which was producing more than half a million a year, plummeted to just ,. But the factory, which employs , workers, is a leading example that Labour wants others to follow.  “The Nissan factory in Sunderland is one of the country’s - one of the world’s - most productive and efficient and world-class places,” Mr Reynolds said. “So why when we have got something as good as that, when we can do things as well as that, are we a place where our growth since the financial crisis for the last decade has been really poor, and is forecast to be poor again after we have the immediate bounce back from the pandemic  “Why are we a place where productivity is the worst it’s been for  years  “How can we, as a prospective Labour Government, learn from places like that and have the policies in place that will make sure we can offer genuinely better jobs, a better future and better growth and prosperity ” New role is demanding Since switching from Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary to the Shadow Business role in November, Jonathan Reynolds has spent more time away from home. Juggling his new job with being a dad to four children - Jack, , Bessie, , Arthur, eight, and Seth, six - is tricky. It’s demanding. Obviously I was delighted to be asked to be in the Shadow Cabinet when Keirwas elected leader,” he said.  “Work and Pensions is a challenging job -a quarter of the whole government budget. “But this is an even more demanding role because the issues we are talking about are central to the country’s success.” He admitted that balancing work and family le “can be challenging”, but added: “My we Claire is incredibly supportive - the whole family are. “The whole family have to be supportive of you to be a politician, certainly at the leading edge. It helps that he knows how to keep his children amused.  “The kids particularly liked my joke on Question Time thatBoris Johnson told me it was raining I would go outside and check,” he quipped. Returning to his roots gave him time to reflect. “It’s fun coming back home to Sunderland today. Being around the city centre and being here, you remember a lot about how you thought about things growing up,” he said. “Being at Nissan is obviously quite a novelty, that you’ve got somebody who went to the comprehensive school down the road coming back as the Shadow Business Secretary.” Mr Reynolds was just  when Jack, who is autistic, was born. “Having Jack at a young age, in terms of just who you are - maturity - it was a really big deal, and Jack having autism and the challenges around that are a really formative experience,” he said. “It was not easy at times but all of that contributes to who you are.” Footballaposs coming home Eyes lighting up as he enters Sunderland AFC’s boardroom, Jonathan Reynolds beams: “I’ve never been in here before, it’s just immense!” The local boy who now sits in the Shadow Cabinet is an avid Black Cats fan, attending a handful of home games each season and following the side away. The Stalybridge and Hyde MP’s last match was the - defeat at Portsmouth in October.  “We got hammered,” he admitted. Mr Reynolds hails from  miles away in Houghton-le-Spring and has supported the team since he was a boy. “My dad’s a Sunderland fan, my granddad was a Sunderland fan, my children are Sunderland fans - despite the fact Stalybridge is fairly close to Man City and a slightly better offer,” he said. His parents even bought him a £ brick in the ,-seater Stadium of Light as it was being built in the mid-s. Now, he is here to host a roundtable discussion with the North East Chamber of Commerce, just a few yards from the hallowed turf. Speaking at the ground after a pilgrimage to admire the mural to club legend Raich Carter, who played  games for the side in the s and captained them to FA Cup and League Championship triumphs, Mr Reynolds said: “People all around the country are passionate about where they come from and care about their football teams.“This really is an expression of identity here in Sunderland.”  He added: “The relationship between working people and football in this country is really strong. “Despite the fact it hasn’t been a particularly easy - I was going to say ‘decades’ - for Sunderland, to come back here is absolutely wonderful. The once mighty club lie third in League One - comfortably among the play off spots, though they have won just one of their past five matches. Brexit is settled  In the run-up to the  Brexit referendum, Nissan’s chairman Carlos Ghosn said that while EU membership was a decision for voters, the company believed a Remain result “makes the most sense for jobs, trade and costs”. Sunderland promptly voted .% to Leave - one of the highest Out majorities in the UK. After campaigning to stay and then promising a second referendum, Labour’s settled position is now to “make Brexit work”. Speaking after touring the Nissan plant, Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “There’s no way you can say there aren’t challenges that come from Brexit - the whole premise of Nissan’s investment in the s, which has grown in scale overtime, they were looking for a berth in the single market.  “Eighty-per-cent of the vehicles they make there are for export, so anything which is increasing bureaucracy, barriers to trade with the single market, it’s a challenge. “But the fact is it has happened. I think there are certainly things that can be done better, but they have got to be trade solutions.“This constitutional argument about structures and being in the European Union, that’s settled. “For Labour it’s about what are the practical things that can be done to reduce those barriers “Clearly that is one of the drag factors on growth at the minute.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jonathan Reynolds MPJonathan ReynoldsLabour PartyPoliticsNissanNissan Motor Company, Ltd.\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It has been announced that Kate will be reading a CBeebies Bedtime Story on Sunday to mark Childrenaposs Mental Health Week, as well as the channelaposs th birthday.A sneak peek photo shows Kate sitting crossed-legged looking casual in jeans and a comfy jumper sitting by a fire as she prepares to read The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark by Jill Tomlinson.The book follows the story of Plop, a baby barn owl, who is helped by others to grow in confidence and overcome his fears - and the story aligns with this years’ theme of the week which is growing together. CBeebies Bedtime Stories airs every night at .pm as the final part of the channelaposs hour-long bedtime segment. But rather than have unknown presenters, stars such as Dolly Parton, Tom Hardy and Bridgertonaposs Rege-Jean Page have all rocked up to lull little ones to sleep sleep recently.Patricia Hidalgo, director of BBC Children’s and Education said: “I couldn’t be more proud to have the Duchess read a CBeebies Bedtime Story as we mark the th anniversary of our CBeebies and CBBC channels. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. It’s such a special and relevant tale and perfectly represents this yearaposs Children’s Mental Health week theme.I can’t wait to see her deliver her own take on such a classic story and I’m sure our audience can’t either.” Kate has been heavily involved in championing childrenaposs mental health and has taken a keen interest in early years development. Just last week, it was announced she would be carrying out a fact-finding mission to Denmark as part of her Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood.  Kensington Palace revealed that she will be flying solo when she travels to the capital Copenhagen for a two-day visit on February  and  without husband Prince William. It is the first time that Kate will bring the centreaposs work to the international stage and on the trip and she hopes to learn from Denmarkaposs example as a country widely recognised as a world leader in its approach and investment in early childhood development. In a personal tweet, the duchess said: “Looking forward to learning from experts, parents  practitioners about Denmark’s approach to early childhood later this month. “Denmark is a beacon of best practice in its approach to the early years, with a culture which prioritises the best start in le.” She ended the message with the Danish words “Pa snarligt gensyn”, which translate as “See you soon”, and the letter “C” to denote a personal tweet. The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark read by The Duchess of Cambridge will air on CBeebies Bedtime Stories at .pm on Sunday, February .

The dismembered bodies were found with their skulls between their legs and were among  bodies.The team of around  archaeologists made the discovery during an excavation being carried out at Fleet Marston, near Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire,The Express reported.One possible explanation for the unusual find is that the decapitated skeletons may have belonged to criminals or outcasts. However, the bones will need to undergo proper analysis before a full conclusion can be reached. This will be completed by the researchers who will be hoping to discover new insights about Roman civilization.It is understood that although decapitation may be a horric act in modern times, the Romans saw it as a normal, albeit marginal, burial rite in the late Roman period. More than , coins and several lead weights were also found on-site, which could suggest that the excavated area was once a thriving location for trade and commerce. And a hoard of domestic objects including spoons, pins and brooches were also uncovered.  Gaming dice and bells were also found which could mean that the Romans gambled here and took part in religious activities. Helen Wass, head of heritage at HS Ltd said: “The HS archaeology programme has enabled us to learn more about our rich history in Britain. “The large Roman cemetery at Fleet Marston will enable us to gain a detailed insight into the residents of Fleet Marston and the wider Roman Britain landscape.All human remains uncovered will be treated with dignity, care, and respect and our discoveries will be shared with the community.” Richard Brown, Senior Project Manager for COPA, said: “The excavation is signicant in both enabling a clear characterization of this Roman town but also a study of many of its inhabitants.” This excavation took more than a year and was done by a team from Cotswold Archaeology and Oxford Archaeology .They were working on behalf of an HS contractor. And this is not the only shocking find that archaeologists have made along the HS line. In fact, Fleet Marston is just one out of over  archaeological sites that have been excavated since .

The mum longs to walk down the aisle at her wedding but was forced to put plans for her big day on hold. Now she is seeking to raise £k for brain surgery so she can be given back her le, after a horrying few years. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereThe mum lives in Ashford, Kent with her science teacher fiancé Robin McNicoll, , and her four children Luis, , Sidney, , Travis, , and Astraea, nine,Fearing she could die at any minute, Louise feels her only hope is surgery available in Spain and is now desperately trying to fund it, saying: I try not to think about what could happen because itaposs terrying. When we first got engaged in April , it was the happiest day of my le. We were at an oak tree with a swing, Robin asked to take a photo of me and he asked me how much I loved him. I didn’t know how to respond and he askedit was enough to marry him. I was euphoric. It was the best feeling.  It was so romantic. Back then we could have never imagined anything like this happening. I want to be able to enjoy my wedding. I don’t want to be screaming and shouting in pain on what should be the best day of my le. I used to always dance with my children, but I havenapost been able to in two years and I desperately want to dance with them again on my wedding day, too. But we are having to come to terms with the fact we might not have that special day for a very long time, as all our money is going towards surgery.Louiseaposs problems started after a minor car accident in December  triggered more than two years of constant and agonising headaches and relentless pain all over her body. She said: Over the next few weeks, I started to have headaches and neck pains, but I assumed it was whiplash. Sadly, that was the start of a living nightmare for Louise, who had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a long-term condition causing pain all over the body, in February , after struggling to cope with stfness and pain. Before that growing up, she had always dislocated knees easily and suffered from random aches and pains, but had not thought much of it. She added: I dislocated my knee a few times, but I just assumed that was normal. I was told I was double-jointed. I had random pains that were unexplained when I was younger and Iaposve always had migraines, but I didnapost worry about them. Despite sometimes feeling like she was walking through cement because of muscle stfness, she put a brave face on things and even enjoyed a trip to Paris later that summer. But the car crash changed everything for Louise. And, in January , she started to experience tremors and what she describes as stroke-like symptoms, such as slurred speech. Since then, she has seen numerous specialists, who have given her a iety of dferent diagnoses.At one point, it was suspected she had multiple sclerosis- a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord. At others, medics have thought she had everything from severe headaches and migraines to possible Chiari malformation, where the lower part of the brain pushes down into the spinal canal. In the meantime, Louise says her symptoms have run riot, as she has experienced everything from slurred speech to agonising headaches and a suspected stroke, which led to numerous investigations, including MRI scans. Feeling increasingly isolated and depressed, for months she was in and out of AE with a host of related problems until desperate for help, in January  she saw an otologist - a specialist in ear diseases - who suggested she joined Facebook groups for people with similar symptoms for support.This was her eureka moment as, through members of a Facebook support group, she was told about a leading expert in her type of symptoms, at the Neuroinstitut in Barcelona, Spain. After examining her MRI and other scans and speaking to her, in April  he diagnosed craniocervical instability - meaning there is excessive movement between her skull and across most of the cervical vertebrae.He recommended spinal fusion surgery, which uses donor bone to strengthen the spine, and skull base decompression surgery - an operation that involves removing a small section of bone from the base of the skull. She also had a private consultation in this country, where she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome- a genetic form of hypermobility. Deciding to stick with these diagnoses, Louiseaposs obstacle now is finding the funding to go to Spain, so she can be treated by the surgeon she has so much faith in. Sadly, with two private operations, airfares and accommodation to pay for while she recovers, she needs £k for surgery and another £k for the additional costs. So, she has launched a GoFundMe page, appealing to kind strangers to help her fund the medical care that she is positive will save her le and eventually see her enjoying the first dance at her wedding. She said: Having the surgery would mean we’d get our lives back, so I can be there for my children and my fiancé. With everything we’ve gone through, it’s taken a massive toll on me, but also on my family, who have become my carers. We just want to go back to a normal le. It would be priceless. It would give us a second chance at le. We could have our dream wedding, which has been put on hold. I want to be a good mum again. I want to be there for my children. I used to dance with my kids every single day and I miss those precious moments so much.You can donate to Louiseaposs fundraiser here.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Multiple sclerosisWedding dayCar crashesNHS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Michael Stone is currently serving three le sentences for the killingsLevi Bellfield claims he bludgeoned Lin and Megan Russell to death Image: ShutterstockByTom PettorCrime EditorPeter Kirkham:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb  Former Met murder detective Peter Kirkham has examined monster Levi Bellfield ’s claim that he bludgeoned Lin and Megan Russell to death.Michael Stone is currently serving three le sentences for killing mum Lin and her six-year-old daughter, who were found in a lane to death in Chillenden, Kent, in .Stone, , was also found guilty of trying to murder Megan’s sister Josie, then nine - but claims he is innocent. His solicitor says he has a statement by Bellfield, , describing how he carried out the double murder. He says he was wearing washing up gloves and holding a hammer as he stopped the family on a lane. He claims his intention was to “just attack Lin”, but changed his mind on hearing screams. He claims he threw the hammer in the river near Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. But is Bellfield – serving two whole le orders for the murders of Millie Dowler, Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange – telling the truth or playing a sick game  Here, ex-Det Chief Insp Kirkham provides his analysis – and verdict. The new statement  This will be the starting point for any potential review and will drive any further action considered necessary. Detectives would look at exactly what the statement contains and compare it with what is already in the public domain. As it runs for four pages, it sounds like it will contain a lot of detail. Bellfield will also know that the police will be expecting detailit is to be believed. The murders of Lin and Megan Russell, and the almost fatal attack on Josie, has received a huge amount of publicity over the last  years. The police would look for anything signicant in the statement which is not already in the public domain. I suspect there are very few facts left in this category, given the number of legal processes through which the case has passed and the amount of media interest and coverage. If there are any signicant dferences between Bellfield’s account and what is objectively known already then the statement will be seriously undermined. Credibility of Bellfield  Whether or not there is any new information in the statement, the credibility of Bellfield will be an important factor. If, as I suspect, there is little or new veriable information in the statement, this aspect will be of central importance. The police would ask “Is Bellfield a reliable source ”. In this case, we know he has a track record of making unreliable claims. In  he denied having anything to do with the Russell murders. He appears to like playing mind games with the police – the senior investigating officer who convicted him of the murders for which he is serving a whole le sentence, DCI Colin Sutton, below, has said as much in the past. This may well just be Bellfield’s latest attempt to confuse, embarrass or undermine the police. They will be extremely cynical and will take a considerable amount of convincing that his claim is true and reliable. Does it fit with Bellfieldaposs pattern of offending   Offenders tend to start off with more minor offences and work up to more serious ones. This also applies to the modus operandi in that they would tend to start with simpler and less dramatic methods and, over time, build to more complex methods. Unusually Bellfield is known to have committed a number of very violent murders and other attacks in the first few years of this century. Each of the offences involved Bellfield attacking a lone female in an urban environment so the circumstances of the Russell murders are very dferent. His potential involvement in these murders has been known for some time and the police have already looked at it and found no evidence linking him to them. Strength of the case against Michael Stone  The flip side of assessment of Bellfield’s admissions is looking at the strength of the case against any other suspects, in this case, Michael Stone. The case against him is not the strongest. It originally involved a number of prisoners saying he had made admissions and at least two of them have now been shown to have been mistaken or lying. The Appeal authorities are aware of this, however, and his conviction stands despite that being the case. There is very little actual, direct evidence against him but, that said, the absence of direct evidence is not evidence that he was not responsible. The circumstances of the Russell murders is such that an experienced investigator would not expect to find much,any, direct evidence. It did not take place in an area where CCTV footage might be expected. Bellfield is seeking to persuade us he is responsible for the murders for which Stone has been convicted. This means he will have to produce a very convincing admission to convince the police, the Courts or anyone  that it is true and Stone is therefore innocent. Credibility and reliability of witnesses  As well as the credibility of Bellfield himself, the police will have to look carefully at the credibility of the others involved in the case. Of central relevance in this regard is Bellfield’s ex-we who is definitely not someone who might be expected to be supportive of him. She has said that she was with Bellfield in the west London area on the day of the Russell murders, more than  miles away in Kent. She has a good reason to remember the exact day as it was her birthday and this helps to underpin her recollection. She is adamant that Bellfield had no opportunity to murder the Russells that day. Her account is about as credible and reliable as these things get. Stone’s lawyers have claimed that there is a witness who says they saw Bellfield in the area of the attack on the Russells. This witness has come forward long after the events and her “recognition” of Bellfield is based on pictures of him she has seen in the papers and on TV. Eyewitness identication is well known to be problematic as evidence. My View  As we do not know exactly what is in the statement produced by Bellfield, it is impossible to make a hard and fast decision as to whether it is likely to be reliable and true. It is, however, possible for me to give an informed professional opinion as to the likelihood of that turning out to be the case. And, in short, I have little doubt that it will turn out to be . Most,not all, of the actual checkable facts in the statement will undoubtedly turn out to be already in the public domain thanks to the acres of coverage that the murder of the Russells has received over the twenty-odd years since it happened. Bellfield has plenty of time on his hands to research the case in great detail and find even the more obscure facts, which have received little focus. He is also capable of constructing a convincing  narrative from the facts he has available and, as a murderer himself, he is well placed to come up with convincing things to fill any gaps.  He is known to lie to the police and run them around the houses. I very much suspect he doesn’t like the police at all and he might therefore be motivated to produce a  account simply to get at them. He is also known to play sick games with investigators which, intentionally or otherwise, have the effect of torturing the families of victims. It would be extremely unusual for the same offender to have committed the Russell murders as a first fatal attack, several years before falling back to a far simpler MO which he then used consistently.It would also be very unusual for him to have committed the murders so far away from the area of West London in whichhe feels confident and safe only tothere for his subsequent offending.The conviction of Stone is not based on the strongest of evidence but it has been subject to long and thorough review. Two juries were satisfied of his guilt having heard the evidence.Because of the nature of the evidence against Stone, I am not giving too much weight to the fact Stone has been convicted whenit comes to assessing the admissions by Bellfield.And, of course, evenStone were innocent, it would not mean that Bellfield is telling the truth. I do not believe that Bellfield’s admissions are convincing, on the basis of what we know right now. He has a track record of saying things and then retracting them and he is known to like playing mind games with the police. There are several “red flags” waving over his admissions. Taken together they make me believe the statement is just the latest in a long line of lies from him. Although I am pretty certain that Bellfield is very likely to have committed other serious offences for which he has not been prosecuted or convicted, I do not think that the  murders of Lin and Megan Russell are amongst them.

Despite a brief split in , the Duke of Cambridge proposed during a trip to Kenya and Kate said aposI doapos in April . But according to a royal expert, Kate started making subtle changes to her appearance before the engagement in . Speaking on Channel aposs documentary William  Kate: Too Good To Be True, royal author Tom Quinn explained that Kate started to change her wardrobe in order to be seen as more appropriate by the palace and the public.

Click here to sign up Her clothing almost began to reflect what people saw in her character, a kind of restraint, kind of modesty almost, he said. I think that did come about because William and Kate were coming towards the point where they would announce their engagement. It was Kate starting to behave in ways which would be seen more appropriate for a future Queen.The couple made their first public appearance together at their university graduation from St Andrewaposs, which was attended by the Queen, Prince Charles and Carole and Michael Middleton. Royal expert Victoria Arbiter adds: Graduation for William and Kate, it really was their last moment in that protective bubble. I think perhaps they might have both been a bit naive about what was to come. William understood how the media works but Kate would have had no idea what it meant to be on the receiving end. All eyes were on the prince, with an engagement announcement expected at any moment, however, it wasnapost until Kate made a surprise appearance at Williamaposs graduation with her parents that experts were  per cent sure she was aposThe One.aposBut it appeared William had reservations about his future with Kate.While many predicted that William would propose soon after the pair graduated in , it didnapost happen.And it wasnapost until many years later that William asked Kate to be his we, with his dad Prince Charles famously joking: They have been practising long enough.

But the car salesman was left stunned when his boss called to tell him to switch off his phone because the bill seems a little high. John said he nearly fainted when BT told him how much the GB of data heaposd used would cost. He told The Sun : “My boss called and said you’re going to have to switch off the phone. The bill seems a little high.“I said ‘What is it ’ He said £,. Next day he phoned back and said, ‘Definitely switch it off, it’s now £,’.” Johnaposs boss Paul Trotter, , of AAA Performance in Rainford Merseyside, said he nearly fell off my chair when BT shared the bill. He added: It’s obviously a computer error. I’ve had a look at the bill and it shoots up £ every  seconds or so. That’s just not possible.“EvenJohn was downloading Hollywood blockbusters there’s no way he’d have gone that much over.” Because John is on a business contract, which includes just MB of data, no warning was given when he exceeded the limit. Paul added: “I was worried at first but I’m confident BT will realise it’s just an error. “John had a great holiday so there’s no harm done and we’ve even managed to laugh about it.” A spokesman for BT said they will erase the huge bill after Johnaposs story was made public.He said: “We understand this is a very signicant bill to receive, so, on this occasion, we are waiving the surplus roaming charges. “In this case, the customer was on a BT Business mobile plan which included a monthly data allowance of MB. When travelling in Turkey he far exceeded his agreed limit by consuming GB of data. We alerted him several times that he had exceeded his data allowances, that standard roaming charges were in place and that he was incurring high usage. Our records show that the customer chose not to include a data cap as part of his plan. “We always recommend customers opt for a roaming cap, as the vast majority of our business customers do. We also urge customers to pay attention to any notications we send them around their data allowance.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Energy billsPhone bill\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She shut down the site in  - just months before her engagement to Prince Harry was announced - although snippets from the blog still exist online. And one of them shows that in a bizarre twist of a fate, Meghan once blogged about the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs wedding - before she even met Harry. It came in , four years before her own royal wedding to Harry. She wrote about the pomp surrounding Kate and Williamaposs  wedding and how she grew up dreaming of becoming a princess. Her post said: Little girls dream of being princesses. I, for one, was all about She-Ra, Princess of Power. For those of you unfamiliar with the aposs cartoon reference, She-Ra is the twin sister of He-Man and a sword-wielding royal rebel known for her strength.

It will cost us, the taxpayer, £,. That’s the price of the civil service and police time spent probing No parties that should never have happened. The nation is rightly furious that the Prime Minister cared so little for the Covid rules he himself imposed that he put living it up before his duty to protect lives and livelihoods. Our PM gave not one jot about those who were forbidden from saying a final face-to-face goodbye to a dying loved one – or the family get-togethers we all did without because we were obeying his rules. Patsy Stevenson is angry too. She was fined £ for breaking lockdown restrictions to honour the memory of murdered Sarah Everard.  There was no cheese and wine at the vigil Patsy attended on London’s Clapham Common. Yet police pinned her down to arrest her, while ignoring food and booze pouring into No. The cost of the Partygate inquiry would be better spent on shielding women and girls from the kind of predator who snatched Sarah’s le away. And this investigation would not be needed had Mr Johnson and his staff accepted that rules also apply to them. This PM is on borrowed time. We will party – legally – when it finally runs out. A great honour for Camilla Camilla Parker Bowles may have been a skilled horsewoman, but she had a rough ride of it when she became Duchess of Cornwall. Many people could not forgive her for the part she played in the break-up of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage. But that was nothing compared to the fences the Queen had to jump within her own family while trying to maintain the dignity of royalty and respect for the monarchy. Both were tarnished when grandson Prince Harry turned his back on royal duties and skipped off to America to give a toe-curling interview to Oprah Winfrey, and strike ­embarrassing deals with Netflix.  It pained the Queen greatly when she had to strip her favourite son, Prince Andrew, of his titles as he faces accusations of sexual assault in a US court. But her duty to the nation demanded it, and the Queen has always put that before personal feelings. Throughout, Camilla has been steadfastly by the Queen’s side, her support in times of trouble. And just like the Sovereign, she negotiates the pathways of public le without putting a foot wrong – a ready smile and a kind word are always on her lips. The Queen is not one to ignore such loyalty and dedication. And today, as she becomes the first British monarch to reign for  years, she wants the world to know that when the time comes, Camilla will be called Queen Consort. We are delighted Camilla is to receive the honour. As they say in royal circles, she’s a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us.

Sources have confirmed to The Mirror that the Prince of Wales spoke to both of his sons in the weeks leading up to the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee anniversary, prior to the monarch’s bombshell announcement on Saturday. In the surprising announcement, Queen Elizabeth II declared it was her “sincere wish” that Camilla take on the title of Queen Consort.The move was hailed as an “extraordinary” gesture by royal watchers.She broke the news in an address to mark the anniversary of her taking the throne  years ago on February . For years insiders were sure Camilla would take the title Princess Consort when Prince Charles became King. But conventional wisdom was brushed aside in the bombshell pm statement from the Palace, announcing the monarch’s wish that Camilla be known as Queen Consort.  The conversation between the Duke of Sussex and his father come after concerns of a rt between the pair, following Harry’s departure from le as a senior working royal.A royal expert last year suggested Prince Charles was hit hard by Prince Harryaposs decision to quit the Royal Family and move to the US. Royal journalist and author Robert Jobson said: I think that he [Charles] was closer to Harry and that’s why it’s hit him quite hard with what’s happened with Harry.The comments came amid claims Harry had broken the ice and taken small steps in healing his rt with Charles and brother Prince William at Prince Philipaposs funeral.Harry is said to have talked briefly with Charles, but issues between the two were thought to have remained unresolved. However, last month it was revealed that Prince Charles has offered an olive branch to Harry by inviting his family to stay with him when they next visit the UK. Royal sources confirmed the Prince of Wales has expressed his firm wish to spend quality time with his grandchildren, having not seen Archie since he was six months old and not ever meeting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s baby daughter, Lilibet Diana, who was born in June.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and his we Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood.But Charles’s good-natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. It was thought that Harry and Meghan would certainly make an effort to attend events to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee in June. Harry is understood to have told family members he would attend a memorial service for his late grandfather Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey, which is planned for April.However, it has emerged that the Duke of Sussex claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the Royal Family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Royal sources have confirmed the Prince of Wales has held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with his son, Meghan and the children during the past few months. One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children. “This is something he is hoping to remedy which is why he made the gesture for Harry, Meghan and the children to stay with himthey wanted to, whenever they may come home for a period of time. “In the meantime, there has been a series of good-natured and enjoyable calls between them all which is something the prince very much look forward to.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Charles, Prince of WalesPrince WilliamHome Officepolitan PoliceRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the Prince of Wales has no doubts that he will be based at the central London palace with the Cambridges possibly living at Windsor Castle, it has been reported.Charles currently lives with his we Camilla at Clarence House, the former residence of the Queen Mother.A source said that Charles is convinced that Buckingham Palace is symbolically the home of the monarch and that he should be based there when king. They told the Daily Mail : “There is no question about it. HRH’s view is that you need a monarch at monarchy HQ. This has never been in doubt.”As well a residence for the monarch, Buckingham Palace is a working operation with more than  million tourists visiting each year and it receives almost , guests. The source continued: The Prince of Wales will not move into Buckingham Palace before he is king. But when he is, he absolutely will. Just like the Queen, it will effectively be in the aposflat above the shopapos. He feels it is right, just as the Queen does, to work out of Buckingham Palace. The Palace will still be a working and entertaining hub and will also still be open to visitors. It is a hugely important tourist attraction. But the prince can still live there at the same time, much like he does at Highgrove, which is also open to the public.  A major refurbishment has been taking place at a cost of £ million for the taxpayer where electrics and plumbing have been improved as part of a general overhaul. The royals have moved out of the building while the work is underway and is due to be completed in . The Cambridgesapos London base is currently Kensington Palace while they also have Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, given to them by the Queen.

In a statement marking her th year on the throne yesterday, the monarch revealed she wants Camilla to take on the title of Queen Consort when Charles becomes King. The move was dubbed extraordinary by some experts, who thought she would follow the trend with the title of Princess Consort.But this is not the first time Her Majesty gave her permission for the duchess to take the role, according to one senior royal source.The source claims the Queen gave her blessing five years ago for Charles to call his we Queen Camila at his coronation.  After the Queenaposs announcement over the weekend, it was also reported that Camilla will receive the Queen Motheraposs priceless  crown when she ascends to the position. The crown famously features the -carat Koh-i-Noor diamond, which originated in India, in a platinum mount. The blessings piled on Camila this week are a world away from the complex relationship between her and the Queen in earlier years. Once referring to her as that wicked woman, Her Majesty disliked Camilla for what she saw as meddling in Prince Charlesaposs marriage with the late Princess Diana. But in recent years, the Queenaposs contempt cooled and insiders say she has been actively preparing the Duchess for her new role.Speaking of Charlesaposs plan to call his we Queen Camilla, the source explained: ‘This is something that has been on the Prince of Wales’ mind for some time, but the timing had to be right.There was a nervousness, they wanted to get it right. ‘It’s been a done deal for some time, but the question has been how best to execute it. You are not going to please everyone.apos  Another senior royal source reportedly said the Queen felt Camilla ‘deserved’ to get the proper title that ‘comes with the job’. They said the Duchess has never tried to aposovershadowapos and always played a apossupportive roleapos but she has also aposcarved a role out for herselfapos. Other changes to the coronation plans have also been made, with officials reportedly shortening it from usual three-hour long event to ‘better reflect the times’ and it will be more reflective of religious, cultural and ethnic ersities.  After the Queenaposs historic announcement this weekend, Charles issued his own statement stating his sheer gratitude to his mother for her support, adding: aposWe are deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother’s wish.apos He also paid tribute to the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee this year, by saying her ‘devotion to the welfare of all her people inspires still greater admiration with each passing year’.

She has claimed she wants to stand out from the other women at a detention camp who are still supporting the terrorist organisation, by changing her look.Ms Begum, who has been living in Al-Roj Camp in northeast since her UK citizenship was stripped in , has spoken to ITV News as part of a new podcast series, presented by Global Security Editor Rohit Kachroo. Shamima Begum: The Blame Game podcast looks at whether the authorities made errors that enabled the -year-old to travel to Syria with two other East London schoolgirls when she was just .She has made messages which have been smuggled out of the camp and sent to a filmmaker. In them she makes clear her despair at being left aposstatelessapos and describes how she has tried to recover from the trauma of losing three babies.  She said: “I’ve moved on from that part of my le, it doesn’t make me feel sad anymore. The podcast also hears from Richard Walton, the former head of Scotland Yardaposs counter-terror command, who led the police investigation into Ms Begumaposs disappearance. In his first interview about the case since leaving his post, he rejects allegations that police failures allowed the three young girls to make it to Syria. Mr Walton claims he led “a textbook investigation” and says faster action by the politan Police could not have stopped the schoolgirls from making it into ISIS-controlled territory.  He claims the girls’ journey to Syria was exploited by extremist organisations for their own purposes, to try and put the blame for this matter on the police. He added: It was not the police that decided to go to Syria. Hundreds of British citizens, including Ms Begum, were stripped of their citizenship by the British government. The podcast, which is out now, also hears from the former head of the United Nations special investigation into ISIS crimes, Karim Kham QC.  He calls for former ISIS members to be put on trial, like those at Nuremberg for Nazi leaders after World War Two. He said: The concern is not where. I really don’t care where the trials take place so long as a fair trial is possible. It’s obvious that it’s absolutely unacceptable and it’s not tenable to have iniduals in aposNo manaposs landapos.There’s no sieving between those iniduals that may be hardened Daesh members who are criminally responsible… and those that may be caught up in the conflict, be they battered wives or abused children.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ISISShamima Begum\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Burglars are checking whether residents are on holiday by pouring kidney beans over doorsteps at night, a home security expert has revealed. Elizabeth Johns explained that robbers use the ploy to seethe beans are cleaned up by residents in the morning - which indicatestheir hunch is right or wrong. If the kidney beans remain untouched, burglars can see the house as a potential target to break into. People are now being warned to look out for the bizarre mark left on neighbouring doorsteps and clean them up where possible.It seems ridiculous, but we heard a while back that people are putting kidney beans on the front of peopleaposs doors, Ms Johns told The Sun. Obviously,youaposre in youaposd clean them up, butyouaposre away thenthe tin of kidney beans was still there then that suggests that youaposre away. Ms Johns said the tactic was being used in the Manchester area to establishanybody is in the house because that makes it a much more desirable target. She also suggested that homeowners could ask a nearby family member or trusted neighbour to keep an eye on their house when they are away. Other methods previously reported to be used by burglars include leaving a strip of sellotape over the front door keyhole. Thieves or squatters can come to the likely conclusion that its occupants are awaythe tape is still there one or several days later. Stickers on wheelie bins and stones stacked up near doorways are other signs that could suggest burglars are targeting your home. In addition to these secret signs, residents should ensure side and back gates are secure and sheds, garages and outbuildings are locked, according to advice from Crimestoppers. It also warns not to leave garden tools or ladders outside, to fit tamper-proof automatic outside security lights and try not to leave accessible windows open at night, even when at home.

The MOL Treasure shipping container, which measures  metres in , has arrived at the DP World Container Terminal at the Port of Southampton, bringing goods from China into the UK.The vessel docked off the coast of England after leaving Yantian on January  this year, the Express reports.According to the latest data, at the container ship port in Southampton, there are currently , container imports being handled. At the same time, there are , containers being exported.  Shipping delays at the end of last year saw concerns that food and toys could run out over Christmas, and experts have warned delays will continue through this year. Giant containers like this one are resupplying a supply chain in the Uk that has been left depleted. The lorry driver shortage has contributed to disruption at UK ports. In December Tim Morris, chief executive officer of the UK Major Ports Group, said that trade ports had become “the jam in the sandwich between surging, volatile shipping and UK supply chains badly impacted by factors such as HGV driver shortages”.  He said: “Ports have taken signicant action to respond to the challenges and build resilience. “They have extended gate opening to  , increased capacity for trucks at peak hours, sought to maximise rail freight usage within the signicant constraints of the network, created additional storage space and recruited more people. “But the pressures are being exacerbated by well-publicised issues impacting all UK supply chains, notably shortages of HGV drivers. “Ports therefore have to manage access to storage space very dynamically in extreme situations. This can mean some very limited short-term restrictions. “Ports are committed to working closely with customers and entire supply chains to keep goods moving.”Retailers have highlighted particular issues in China and east Asia, where pandemic restrictions and poor weather conditions have affected shipping.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON YantianCity of Southampton Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Cambridge University researchers tested seven dferent ways to improve the effectiveness of face masks when it comes to protecting against the virus.The DIY methods included taping the mask to your face to secure it properly, which was effective but uncomfortable or using rubber bands. Other hacks included filling the gaps with bandages or tying the strings for a tighter fit. But the method which showed the most promising results was to wear tights across the bottom half of your face and over your face mask. Face coverings have been criticised for not fitting tightly enough in order to signicantly reduce the viral particles that a person breathes in or out.  But the researchers said this bizarre new hack could close the gaps around the nose and mouth and lower the amount by up to seven times more than a loose face mask. They also noted, however, that it was unlikely to be tolerated for extended periods of time given the physical and social implications of wearing pantyhose on your face in public.The study looked at data from four volunteers who tried the seven dferent methods using both surgical and KN masks, reports MailOnline.While wearing the masks, each of the volunteers did seven minutes of exercises designed to mimic real-le activities such as talking, smiling, bending over, turning their head to the side, nodding and breathing.  The scientists gave them a fit factor score based on how well the masks fit according to the filtration efficiency. They found that better fitting masks have fewer gaps between the edge and the personaposs face, meaning that the air is filtered through the mask. The most effective way of improving the fit of KN masks was using tights and cloth tape which boosted the fit factor by . and . respectively, the findings show. Using gauze to fill the gaps between the face and the KN masks only offered a slight improvement of . while using it on top of the masks only boosted the fit by .. Surgical masks worked betterworn with tights, with a score of ., orthe gaps were sealed with cloth tape, scoring ..  The least effective way of improving their fit was by using rubber bands and tying ear bands with a score of .. But the attempt was still better than wearing a mask alone. Despite the positive benefits and the accessibility of the hacks, the team noted that they were uncomfortable overall. Tights gave the volunteers high levels of discomfort and caused problems with speaking while rubber bands put pressure on the ears and face, they found. Fabric tape was comfortable to wear but not to remove and it could be dislodged over time due to sweat or moving. The researchers said that the results could help designers improve masks and fitting devices.Most scientists agree that wearing a face mask makes a limited contribution to curbing the spread of coronavirus among the wider population.Medical grade masks can be far more resistant than common surgical or cloth masks but they can also be uncomfortable and hard to get hold of. The findings were published in the journal PLOS One.

It was launched last October and has proved so popular orders are already being taken for next year.Makers Jetson, a Swedish-Polish firm, said riders will feel like James Bond when they take to the skies.It adds this is just the beginning – with flying cars this decade. Peter Ternstrom, one half of the brains behind the Jetson One, said: “The first time I flew it, it felt amazing, it’s vibration free so nothing like a helicopter or aeroplane.  “But we have a vision way beyond the Jetson One. By the end of the decade, we want a four-seater flying car on the market, one that can replace a normal family car. “We want to make cities a better place to live and mass transport is going to need to change.” Peter and co-founder Tomasz Patan set up Jetson in  and soon created a prototype.  They developed sensors, backup motors and speed restrictors to make it safe to fly. The Jetson One does not need a runway and has been built to ensure a perfect landing. Peter said he gets a request to buy one every  minutes.  He added: “Imagine turning up to McDonald’s in one of these. People will be thinking is that James Bond  Are they even from Earth ” The Jetson One weighs kg and can fly for  minutes, with a battery charging time of around two hours. It is controlled with a joystick but cannot be flown in cities yet and is only for open land. Peter said this will change and hopes to see % of all wheeled transport moved to the air by . He adds our cities will become greener with less need for parking spaces and roads. Peter’s next plan is to create a two-seater flying car by .

Her actions alerted Edward Suhling and Aby aposJacobapos Chacko to something being wrong. Edward said: The dog was splashing in the water, so we both ran over here and I jumped in the water, and my buddy grabbed his arms and I grabbed his legs and we got him up on shore.

The four-year-old was abducted from her tent in October while on holiday with her family at the Blowholes campsite in Western Australia. It was not until  days later that officers found Cleo alive at an address in Carnarvon, around  miles from where she was taken.Her family have recently opened up about their experience and released a video of their brave little girl dancing with joy after being rescued.Mum Ellie and stepdad Jake shared the moment Cleo began singing and dancing for joy at am, just six hours after being reunited at home. Speaking to  Minutes, Ellie said: She was jumping around and we were dancing, singing. She was just so happy.  That was such a beautul moment just to see her as the old Cleo but you can still see...itaposs still dferent. Ellie said she was shocked when Cleo said oh I havenapost had dinner for a very long time mum after she was rescued and taken to hospital for observation. She told how she is still trying to find out what happened to her little girl who is still dferent and that the family have a long way to go.  She said: “As a parent, you want to…make sure that they stay as a child for as long as they can because you don’t want them to be in this big, bad world, and she lost that, that was taken from her. “She’s probably going to have to be dealing with this for the rest of her le and we’re going to eventually have to find out everything that’s happened and we’re going to have to carry that as well.” Cleoaposs disappearance sparked a huge investigation and gained international attention. Terence Darrell Kelly, , was arrested on the same day Cleo was found and he pleaded guilty to forcibly taking a child aged under  at Carnarvon Magistrates Court.Appearing via video link from the high-security prison Casuarina Prison in Perth, he admitted his guilt and was referred to the WA District Court for a sentence mention in March. Cleo was awake and playing with cars when police found her at around am, Ellie said.  Police confirmed that the house was as it appeared in photos on social media with toys and dolls while Cleo told her mum that she could hear dogs barking, she added. Ellie also recalled the heart-wrenching moment she realised someone had my baby. “She was basically nowhere near me and that was the second I realised that someone had her and both my head and my heart connected to that, she said.  When the pair were finally reunited, Ellie said her daughteraposs first words were hi mummy. She said: “Cleo got onto the phone and she’s like ‘hi mummy’ and I was like ‘hi baby’. It was such a beautul moment.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON abductionCleo SmithAustraliaCrimeMissing persons\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One plan under discussion is to parachute members of  Para and nd Airborne into Poland as a dramatic signal of defiance towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.  On Monday Mr Wallace yesterday announced another  soldiers will be sent to Poland. Speaking in London alongside his Polish counterpart Mariusz Blaszczak, the Army officer said “In that spirit of solidarity and helping share each other’s challenges of resiliences we will add to those  Royal Engineers by sending a further  British troops to Poland in a bilateral deployment to show that we can work together and send a strong signal that Britain and Poland stand side by side.” Two senior defence sources have told the Mirror the troops are “highly likely” to be paratroopers and that many of them will jump into Poland from C- troops carrier warplanes. One insider said: “This has not been absolutely finalised but these troops will very likely be from  Air Assault Brigade and they will very likely jump in.” Sources say it is many years since American and British troops parachuted together into eastern Europe, although they have done it more recently in the States. More than  members of  Para’s B Company are already in Estonia on winter warfare exercises with NATO units including soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment. It is believed members of  Para will be asked to join US airborne troops in demonstrating what the Army calls a Joint Forcible Entry, dramatically dropping into Poland. They are part of  Air Assault Brigade - the UK’s high readiness troops mostly made up of Paratroopers, with signallers, medics and engineers attached.  After jointly parachuting into Poland they would then launch a -day wargaming exercise - as a huge two-finger gesture to the Kremlin, whose troops are currently exercising in Belarus. Sources say the Parachute Regiment is “extremely keen” to perform the drop with the Americans but the MoD and Number Ten are concerned it may be over-aggressive. Senior Parachute Regiment officers have already put forward proposals to PJHQ and the plans are being considered. One source told the Daily Mirror: “The plan is to jump with the nd Airborne who have already arrived, but there is concern and confusion at senior level that any drop will be seen as aggressive and we are waiting for a decision.” The Paras are listed as the UK’s Global Response Force, are already part of an operational readiness capability which was formed with US forces in . More than  British Paras dropped into Ukraine in September , in a joint exercise with local forces and witnessed by the Daily Mirror. They parachuted last year into Jordan with local forces, practising how to battle ISIS and al-Qaeda in counter-terror strikes - an exercise watched by fascinated Russian embassy defence staff.

The luxurious property, in an upmarket suburb boasts five bedrooms, four bathrooms and world class views views of of one of Australiaaposs most famous landmarks. One of the propertyaposs biggest attractions is a aposmesmerisingapos m tunnel which took miners six months to excavate and even has some secret feature within it. Robert and Wendy Procter, brought underground workers from an opal mine in New South Wales to build the tunnel and during the build on the property in Mosman, Sydney.  The underground feature has attracted the attention of potential buyers after it hit the market with a  millionguide price. It has views over Sydney Opera House and the stone-walled tunnel even houses one of the cityaposs most coveted home gyms complete with a glass wall and wood flooring.Mr Procter told realestate.au : Itaposs a big house and the five of them stayed downstairs … the only thing we didnapost supply was alcohol which would have cost more than the tunnel. Described as very James Bond and high-tech by agent Jacqui Rowland of Di Jones Mosman, the stone tunnel stretches almost theof the entire plot and even has a gym in it. But it is the secret spy tunnel tunnel which has left potential buyers in awe of the property.It’s very James Bond and high-tech,” she told realestate.au. “You come out of the garage and walk into the tunnel, the lights come on and there’s music. It’s mesmerising.” The owners have been in the house for more than four decades but decided to build the underground channel to avoid walking  steps from the street to their house. Mr and Mrs Procter spent all of their million budget to create the game-changing tunnel leading from the double garage to a lt which comes to their home.  It means we donapost have to walk up  steps, which is particularly dficult in the pouring rain, Mr Procter said. Now the tunnel which can be accessed through the double garage goes past a subterannean workout area arriving at a the lt which brings users to their luxury home. In total, the project cost them around  million AUDbut the current owners love the addition.  As well as the wow which the tunnel brings viewers can also imagine themselves on its glorious sun balcony or visiting one of its many rooms or bathrooms.And thereaposs plenty of opportunity to enjoy the glorious weather, as the huge kitchen leads to a garden with a barbecue and entertainment area - as well as a heated pool and spa, sundeck and pond water feature.The estate agents realestate.au. say special equipment was used to bore through the stone.It says: The miners used jackhammers for the vertical lt shaft and a special machine that cut through the rock for the tunnel. He said including the lt and landscaping, there wasn’t much change from m for the work, which he says was well worth it. The views over the city are especially good at night when Sydney Opera House is lit up and can be seen from a distance.The outdoor space allows for some solace and is an oasis of calm in the midst of the bustle of the city.But the couple say the tunnel brings the added value and will see them make a tidy profit from their investment many years ago.  They put the grand mansion on the market for an eye-watering £million but only paid £, when they bought it more than  years ago. The property is on the market with DiJones, with expressions of interest closing on  February.

Several months have now passed since Cleo was reunited with her family but her mum Ellie Smith fears that she will never get over what happened.She said that the four-year-old would wake up shouting and screaming in the night initially.  And now she is scared of being behind locked doors while she insists on sleeping with the lights on. Ellie said how Cleo remembers how she was lured away. “She tells us that she was taken because her baby sister was sick,” she told  Minutes. “And so she needed to be taken away from us to that we could help her baby sister. She just knows a reason as to what he’s told her.”  Cleo’s mum told of the joy when she finally heard the news that she was safe, after receiving a call at am from police. She said: “I was asleep when the phone call came through and I was like ‘this is either good or bad’. I’ve answered it and straight away‘I’ve got someone who wants to say hello to you’ and I was swearing, I was like ‘oh my God, no way’. “Cleo got on to the phone and she’s like ‘hi mummy’ and I was like ‘hi baby’.”Back home Cleo quickly got back to playing with her baby sister Isla but Ellie feels that her child has been changed by what happened. She said how she is “dferent and always will be and that’s just our le now.” The toddler is blocking out what took place with her emotions up and down and Ellie feels that she went into “survivor mode”. Kelly, , was arrested on the same day Cleo was found and he pleaded guilty to forcibly taking a child aged under  at Carnarvon Magistrates Court. Appearing via video link from the high-security prison Casuarina Prison in Perth, he admitted his guilt and was referred to the WA District Court for a sentence mention in March.

Pluto is Nobody Dog’s longest resident and the friendly doggo has never stepped foot outside of the rescue centre’s ranch. And now, the manager of the centre says he will die there is nobody steps in to help. Pluto loves to be around other dogs, cats and children, and would thrive with an active family in a rural area. Alena Stan runs Nobody Rescue in Romania and works with the UK organisation, Bridging The Gap Rescue, to unite stray dogs from kill shelters with families across Europe.“He will end his le in the centreno one steps in and shows him the world,” Alena said. “I’ve had Pluto since he was four days old. “He was born in a public kill shelter with his mum and four siblings in December . “His mum and three siblings were adopted, and Pluto and his brother Dino were left behind. Sadly, Dino recently passed away - so Pluto is the last one left.Pluto is Alena’s longest resident at Nobody Dogs rescue centre and the sweetest boy. “The kennels and shelter is all he’s ever known,” she explained. “He has never left the ranch in the woods.” Alena describes Pluto’s personality as “very friendly and active”. “You wouldn’t know he is a senior dog,” she said. Pluto has never shown any signs of aggression, and gets on well with other dogs, cats and children. He walks well on a lead and would love to live with a family and kids in a rural space.  He has never heard any city sounds before or seen a television, so would need time and patience to adapt. Pluto has spent  years trying to find a place to call home, which has been a struggle for Alena. “We are a very small organisation and it’s dficult to adopt dogs in Romania. People don’t look at private centres,” she explained. While Pluto has lived a long and happy le so far at the rescue, it would be amazing for him to experience the rest of the world and find a permanent family. If you think you could be the perfect home for Pluto, please get in touch withNobody Dogs on Facebook.

I had actually played with Scotty when he was on loan at Brechin City from Dunfermline, so I knew what he was capable of. I knew he would fit into our philosophy and how we want to play the game.“My intention was to give him - minutes, but he came on early and worked his socks off and got his reward with the goal and then we had to being him back off because his legs had just went at that point.“He probably needs a bit more game time in terms of match fitness and sharpness but when he gets up to full speed, he will be a real asset for us.“We went short-term and this gives him a chance to get back playing and enjoying his football. And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club. I think that little bit of professionalism and trying to do things in the right manner will help bring him on. He came down and trained with us and as soon as he met the chairman and the boys make everyone feel welcome when they come to the club .“There is a real togetherness there so I think it will suit Scotty going forward so it’s up to him what he does from here until the end of the season. I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two. It was a tough ask to come in and play men’s football when they were just desperate for results. So it probably wasn’t the ideal fit for him. Going forward, coming to us will suit him as he has an eye for a pass and an eye for a goal and is comfortable on both feet. He can go outside or inside and has a bit of pace.

As a kid I was part of the Peebles Cycling Club..remove“[In] Peebles and Innerleithen is really where my cycling began. I grew up learning to ride mountain bikes and exploring.“It’s a fantastic area for riding bikes, it’s the trail I know best and I think it’s a great area for folks to be riding bikes.”Now, the -year-old is hoping that the first Muck n’ Mac Festival will not only be a fun event for the adult riders taking part, but will also encourage young people to get outside more.“The big driver is the cycling aspect,” he said. “To get more folk out riding bikes and to look at cycling from a dferent perspective.“I think there’s a lot of people, like myself for example, who were very much into the competitive side of it and kind of fell out of love with it.“So we’re trying to look at cycling from a dferent perspective and add extra elements to it, not so much the serious racing approach.“With the event being free for kids and the outdoor activities, just trying to get kids hooked on that outdoor type lestyle and getting more involved in the outdoors.”A full weekend riding ticket is £, a ticket for a single day riding is £, and a festival village pass is £.All tickets include the cost of camping at Traquair.For more information, visit: www.mucknmacfest"},{"url":null,"title":"youth-climate-activists-play-part-town","story":"PUPILS at a Peeblesshire school have highlighted the climate crisis with a walk through the community, handing out leaflets.Last week the young climate activists from St Ronan’s Primary School took to the streets in Innerleithen to raise awareness of climate change.And the youngsters also gave leaflets to passersby and displayed handmade signs featuring a range of environmental messages.Dawn Taylor, depute headteacher at St Ronan’s said: “The group are very passionate about sharing their climate message.“They have been involved in organising and planning the event showing great initiative, independence and leadership.“This learning has linked in really well with COP and the children’s passion for the environment, but has also supported the development of our school core skills for learning, le and work.“The children are all from our Primary  cohort within the school and have led art lessons and learning activities within their classrooms in order to raise awareness around protecting the environment.“They have also organised and advertised the local awareness walk around the community.“The walk today is taking place both around the school and the local community and is a way for them to share their important message.“We are very proud of them here at St Ronan’s Primary School.”"},{"url":null,"title":"townsend-not-getting-carried-away-england-win","story":"A delighted Gregor Townsend hailed his Scotland players after they retained the Calcutta Cup with a - victory over England at BT Murrayfield yesterday.London Irish scrum-half Ben White opened the scoring after good work by Hawick man Darcy Graham then a penalty try followed after England hooker Luke Cowan was sinbinned following a deliberate knock-on.  Finn Russell also converted two penalties and a conversion of the White try.It was the first time since  that Scotland had won back-to-back games in the fixture and the fans celebrated long into the Edinburgh night.The Borders’ man isn’t getting carried away with thoughts of a first Six Nations title though and remembers last year when they failed to build on the victory over England at Twickenham by losing to Wales at Murrayfield.He said: “Last year we started really well, and that showed the confidence the players had from their win at Twickenham. We were - upso how we prepared last year was fine.“It was just how we dealt with situations like not scoring a try in the Wales  at the end of the first half and giving away three penalties in a row to hand momentum back to Wales, then in the second half, not dealing with the red card when we needed to adjust.“Confidence and belief is important, it gives you the ability to adapt and show character, but we have to deliver the detail as well. We can be better than this week, and we believe Wales will be better than they showed this week.“Being tough to beat is really important. It usually defines championship-winning teams, a strong defence in any sport. We know our defence is really entwined with our attack. We’ve got some really dangerous attackers in our team who we want to give the ball to.“Getting both of those sides of the game right is so important.

But a resilient and strong Pupils defence of Finlay Kerr, Josh Arkell, Euan Dott and Ryan Harding, assisted with the confidence of Lorne Paterson in goal stood firm.Captain Arkell once again led by example and is forming an excellent partnership in the centre of defence with Dott, who has replaced Kyle Paterson who has not played since October  with injury.The introduction of Andrew Semple at left midfield with  minutes to go started to stable things as the Pupils dug deep and showed great character as the East Dunbartonshire side pressed for an equaliser.With  minutes on the clock, as Rossvale pressed again, Euan Dott won two strong challenges on his -yard line before sending an inch-perfect long through ball to Ellis, the Pupils# top scorer, who made no mistake with a left-footed finish.Scott Oman made a welcomein goal, replacing Paterson, and made a good save from McHugh just after he came on.The y lay-off showed in the second half but the under s saw the result out and should be hugely proudly of themselves for what is a fine result against a very good side.This Sunday, January , the Pupils under s travel to Glasgow to face another stern test against Gfnock SC.Kick-off is .pm at Eastwood Park, Rouken Glen Road, Gfnock, G UG."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 21 2022","story":"People from across the political spectrum have reacted with shock to the Scottish Government#s announcement of a complete -week closure of the Clyde cod box.Kintyre and the Islands councillor Alastair Redman, Independent, described the move as a #betrayal# while South Kintyre councillor John Armour, SNP, said he was #dismayed# to hear about the #draconian measures#.Councillor Armour described it as a #slap in the face# to the fishing industry and Clyde Fishermen#s Association which has gone #far beyond# what was required of it over the last  years and more.Jenni Minto MSP, also SNP, was due to meet with the Cabinet Secretary on Wednesday to relay the concerns of Argyll#s fishing communities and she said she would be asking for a full breakdown of the science which led to the decision.And Argyll and Bute Council leader, Kintyre and the Islands councillor Robin Currie, Liberal Democrats, has written to the Scottish Government in support of local fishing industry representatives who have shared with him their #signicant concerns#.Surely with Argyll#s political leaders united in their opposition to the full closure, without exemptions, along with the public outcry since the news was announced, the ministers responsible will be forced to reconsider this potentially industry-ending decision."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 21 2022","story":"For most of us, our sight is our most precious sense by far.For anyone diagnosed with a condition that could affect their sight, or who has experienced sight loss, having someone who understands what you#re going through can make a huge dference.This is where the Royal National Institute of Blind People #s free #Need to Talk# counselling and confidence building service comes in.#Need to Talk# gives anyone affected by sight loss, as well as their friends and family, the opportunity to have a free hour-long mental wellbeing check-in, further counselling, and to attend #Living Well with Sight Loss# courses.We#re here to help people talk through some of the issues that are affecting them.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it - with  minutes remaining to end the match as a contest, giving the score line a harsh look from a Pupils# perspective, having competed well with their lofty opponents for an hour of the contest.And while such defeats are always tough for a team#s players and management, they still offer valuable on-field experience for the young Pupils players in the squad, as they adjust to a higher, more physically demanding level of football in the West of Scotland FL.The Pupils have nine fixtures left to play this season – five at home and four away – and are on the road again tomorrowagainst second-placed Finnart FC, at Springburn Park.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

Its A-listed home has been repaired and upgraded, its environmental performance has been dramatically improved, new displays have been created and thousands of local people were consulted about what they wanted to see.

We called on both the UK and Scottish governments to appropriately fund the citys cultural collections through A Fair Deal for Glasgow.An Arabesque Carpet being reinstalled at the Burrell Collection The funding for the Burrell revamp is an example of groups coming together and last October the UK Governmnet announced a £million package for the museum.Nearly half of the funding for the £. million project was committed by Glasgow City Council with more than a quarter coming from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and signicant donations from the Scottish Government, the UK Government, and from many generous trusts and private donors.Caroline Clark, Director for Scotland, The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said the revitalised building now showcases this extraordinary collection in a modern and open space that is accessible to everyone.\"Thanks to National Lottery players, our £. million in funding has secured strong outcomes for The Burrell Collection and the many people who will enjoy visiting in the future, helping to drive tourism to the area and ensure that this wonderful Collection can be enjoyed for many generations to come,\" Ms Clark said:Culture Minister Neil Gray said he was delighted it would reopen to the public again adding: \"The Scottish Government has contributed £. million in funding to the project which includes £, to support cost increases due to the pandemic.

While it was closed, objects from the Collection were seen by more than a million people on loan to museums in New York, Paris, Japan and London. "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-stop-causing-needless-alarm-elderly-pensions","story":"I don’t doubt the complexity, but have the authors overstated the uncertainty The UK Government’s own document “State Pensionyou retire abroad” states in its first sentence “You can claim State Pension abroadyou’ve paid enough UK National Insurance contributions to qualy”, making clear that following payment of contributions there is a liability to pay a state pension, consistent with the terms of the scheme at the time.Of course, these terms can change, “reduce, or even, in principle, eliminate”. Certainly, the state pension has ied in real value over the years, but it is no less clear that, in any post-Yes vote negotiation, pension liability could not be valued on the basis of something that might or might not happen several years later.As for elimination of pensions, the politics of telling the UK’s grey vote, and the expats all over the world, that they are not getting their pension any more is, in terms of political disaster, much worse even than Downing Street parties.Likewise, it is possible that the UK Government might challenge its liability on the basis that “the tax and NICs made by Scottish residents were used to pay for public services that they previously enjoyed”, but this is not what its own website says. Moreover, would this argument be applied to pensioners in the continuing UK Lastly, as the authors point out, “the UK Government can change the qualying rights for state pensions as it sees fit”. However, how can this be done to exclude only Scots. What would a requirement, for instance, to live in the continuing UK mean for British expats living in Spain Many of the uncertainties in the report are therefore just too horrible politically to contemplate, or involve so many dficulties that their complications would surely triumph. The logical solution is surely to negotiate an agreement about ision of assets and liabilities, and secure reciprocal agreements. I don’t doubt the complexity or that certainty is imperfect, but with goodwill on both sides, rather than weaponising the issue to cause fear among the elderly, I am sure a solution agreeable to both sides can be forthcoming.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SNPS WISHFUL THINKINGI NOTE the debate on the SNP’s assertions that the UK would fund Scottish pensions after independence. This is an extreme case of wishful thinking, as today’s taxes pay pensions, because there is no pension pot to draw on.At present the workers in the  million population pay the pensions of that population. If Scotland were to be independent, surely the workers in the  million population of rUK would pay the pensions of that population and the workers in the six million population of Scotland would pay our pensions Why would the UK Government agree to fund, out of current taxation, the pensions liability of a dferent country, when that country is receiving the tax from their own workers at the same time Scotland has a demographic handicap with fewer working people supporting all forms of benefit. The SNP solution to this is large immigration of young people, which kicks the can down the road as they will all be old and entitled to a pension one day. Pension planning in the UK and Scotland is broadly similar to a Ponzi scheme, where increasing the population gives more workers to pay pensions and benefits. This lets politicians pass the problems associated with us all living longer down to the next generation.Nicola Sturgeon says that people will notice no dference or get a bigger pension this is extremely unlikely, given that it would need the UK politicians to completely capitulate to the SNP viewpoint.The experts writing in your paper on Saturday, David Bell of the University of Stirling and David Eiser of the Fraser of Allander Institute, seemed to suggest that a fudge agreement would be most likely .Certainly more of a drawback to, than an advantage of, independence.John Leonard, Falkirk.HAVE A PLAN BEFORE THE SPLITTHE dissolution of the United Kingdom brought on by Scottish independence means that the two newly-independent entities would have no claim to UK Treasury funding as the UK would have ceased to exist. In other words pensions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland would not be paid by the UK nor would Scotland’s pensions.Arrangements would have to be made prior to the split ensuring that the qualying conditions for pension payments to former UK pensioners apply equally to both new states perhaps continuing to be based on the qualying conditions of the former UK pension scheme.Payments up to the date of the split could be overseen by a joint board of the two new states and financed by the same mechanism as before. In effect all previous UK pensions would continue to be paid as normal and from the same revenue base. This revenue stream would be the same as before but now burcated. Both new states could then review the amount of pension paid within their jurisdictions.Don Ferguson, Kirkintilloch.WE NEED ALL THE ANSWERS EARLYI WOULD sincerely hope that all negotiations regarding finance, pensions, taxation, border controls and so on are satisfactorily settled before any independence vote. Otherwise the Scottish electorate will have no understanding of the effects of voting Yes.No intelligent person votes for something without knowing what they will get as a result.Previous voters were not told of the chaos which would ensue when voting to leave. We need the truth of the outcomes before there is a vote.Barbara Jarvie, Milton of Campsie.NORWAY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICESI ALMOST choked on my Corn Flakes this morning while reading Michael Sheridans letteron the subject of Norway.Norway, in his view it seems, is only a thriving economy thanks \"disproportionately\" to the might of Great Britain and the United States, who apparently have kept the \"free world\" open and alive to capitalist endeavour. That world order, it would appear, has provided infinite pathways, both physical and financial, for Norway to expand and flourish.No mention of the mighty \"free world\" heroes having invaded or plundered other nations, stolen their resources or having killed their indigenous populations throughout history, in pursuit of the great capitalist utopia. Mr Sheridan goes on to deride Norway for pursuing \"a long-standing policy of military neutrality and exclusion of nuclear weapons\". How very dare they!We are urged by Mr Sheridan to believe that the rest of the \"free world\" is to be grateful to the might of Great Britain and the United States for the free flow of capitalism, and that Norway is a political passenger and a fortunate beneficiary of our unparalleled might.Hilarious.Kevin Orr, Bishopbriggs.* I AGREE with Michael Sheridan that Norway is not a legitimate comparator for Scotland but disagree with his reasons for saying so. The crucial dference, which appears to have escaped Mr Sheridans notice, is that Norway is an independent nation and Scotland is not. He employs the blatant oxymoron of explaining thatall the nations of the free world shared Norways aversion to militarism and nuclear weapons there would be no free world.Norway, as a free and independent nation in the s, was able to make its own choices regarding North Sea oil and gas our Scottish nation was in a very dferent situation and it is now clear that great efforts were made by the UK Government at that time to conceal the full potential economic benefits of North Sea resources from the people of Scotland.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WILL THE SPIN DOC SURVIVE BORIS Johnson’s new Director of Communications, Guto Harri, told the press that our beloved and boisterous PM sang \"I Will Survive\" when they met on Friday.

This helped to fuel republican sentiment and reawaken the independence movement – in the words of the Coronation Coronach, “Nae Liz the yin, nae Lillibet the twa, nae Liz will ever dae, and we’ll mak oor land republican in the Scottish breakaway”. Pillar boxes with the offending EIIR insignia were blown up by “Sky-high Joe” and the use of EIIR was dropped. As far as I am aware, this policy continues to the present day.

For example, why have a full catering facility on vessels with passage time of under one hour with all the attendant costs and requirement for crew accommodation  Why build a ferry for £ million when a suitable equivalent may be built in one-third of the cost in one-third of the time  Time for radical change and more careful husbandry of taxpayers money.J Patrick Maclean, Oban.DONT KNOCK SCOTTISH ACCENTI EMPATHISE totally with Amy Kinnairdand we should remember that the Scottish pronunciation of \"Standard English\" has a much closer relationship between spelling and sounds than most English speakers of English. I may get pelters for this, but for example the \"er\" sound at the end of words is often an \"a\" as in \"finga\", \"computa\", and so on. I taught English as a foreign language in three dferent areas in Spain and never encountered any problems with my Scottish accent – Ooviously modied and at a slower pace. The Scottish \"ch\" and our clear use of \"r\" helped their understanding. It also helped with my Spanish communication.So please, do not knock the Scottish language or any other non-Standard English accent. They all have a place to play in our increasingly erse nation.

It’s about Saturday. We’ve started off well, don’t even mention those two words! Honestly, let’s keep our feet on the ground.  “We’ve beaten England before – we beat them last year and we didn’t win anything . “I would like to think Scotland have got a very good chance of winning on Saturday and then we’ll worry about anyone  after that.” Scott was equally exasperated. “I look back to the squads of  and  when nobody was thinking ahead, it was literally about the next game,” said the former centre. “They just concentrated on what was in front of them next. Nobody got carried away, especially the media.” Perhaps there is more hype now than these two legends experienced in their pomp, but the game has moved on from those amateur days of dignied understatement, and they acknowledge that it would be much worsethere was no optimistic chatter surrounding the Scotland team this week because that would mean that they had come up short against England last Saturday. As it is, the Scots are flying high after achieving back-to-back successes against the Auld Enemy for the first time in  yearsand are looking ahead to a trip to Cardf to take on a Wales team reeling from their - drubbing at the hands of Ireland at the weekend. So, this refusal to jump on the hype train should not be mistaken for a lack of admiration for what Scotland have achieved so far – or a lack of belief in what is possiblethe players and coaching team keep their focus. “You look at that performance by Scotland on Saturday and there was a full understanding of everything that happened in that game: from Finn Russell’s kicking to the defensive , to the way they coped with England’s power up-front,” agreed Scott. “In the past, some of their games have been littered with simple mistakes, but there was a unity in that performance. When Scotland go down to Cardf, they must continue to turn the screw. “The Principality Stadium Stadium will be a tough nut to crack, so they just have to knuckle down and concentrate on their own game,” he added. “There have been times in the past few years when they have gone there, played that high-tempo style, and then fallen out the game. “You have to still be in the game in the last  minutes. On Saturday they stayed in the game, stayed confident in the way they carried the ball into contact, and it will have to be the same in Wales. It is going to have to be like Groundhog Day – repeat, repeat, repeat.\"Meanwhile,Gavin is frustrated that his son, stand-off Adam, was not involved in last weekend’s game and is not going to be involved in this coming weekend’s match having been left out of Townsend’s training squad for this campaign, then he was not letting on. “I thought Finn Russell [the incumbent stand-off] had a magnicent game against England and his goalkicking was key to that, as was his kicking from hand,” he said. “His thread-through in the second half when England had lost Luke Cowan-Dickie was a massive moment. His game management was terric.” The Grand Slam Dinner is being held at Edinburgh International Conference Centre on Saturday st May, with tickets now on sale. The event – which is being held to help raise awareness and funds for Hearts + Balls, a charity which supports former players who have suffered serious injuries – was supposed to take place back in  to mark the th anniversary of the  Grand Slam but was postponed due to Covid. “Rugby has sorely missed these big group celebrations - and charities have been hit hard by not being able to utilise vital fundraising streams,” said Scott.  “Of course, the evening will be incredibly enjoyable, but to be able to know that we’re making a real dference to members of the rugby community who need our support makes it all the more special. “Hearts + Balls is an incredible charity that every single one of us is proud to be able to support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"todays-wordle-answer-clues-wordle-234-tuesday-february-8","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter F.Another clue  Its useful for pictures.If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

Children from P , P  and P  are instead accessing learning from home. Three classes — P, P  and P — and the nursery remain open.On Monday evening, Orkney Islands Council shared hopes to reopen the school fully on Wednesday, with further updates to be confirmed today, Tuesday.Head teacher Islean Gibson has been meeting with representatives from the education service and public health on a daily basis and this will continue as required.She has also been communicating directly with families on the ever-evolving situation and is heartened by the support shown.“We are confident that the home learning on offer to our three classes is working well for families at this time,# Miss Gibson said.#Part of our meeting involved planning for the rest of this week, and I will be writing out to everyone as soon as is possible tomorrow to let parents know what we hope we can provide across the remainder of this week.“It has been an exceptionally tough day for staff and a tricky balance in terms of in class teaching and making sure we have learning going home, so I thank all from the bottom of my heart for the understanding as we all try to get to grips with our new normal for today and tomorrow. To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was incredibly useful in earlier stages of the pandemic but it has become increasingly redundant in recent months.“We are nearing the point where Test and Protect is no longer an effective use of scarce NHS resources.“As we start to move beyond the pandemic, our approach must adapt to fit the new situation.”Health Secretary Humza Yousaf described the proposal as “reckless”.“Call from Scot Tories to stop funding Test  Protect at this stage of the pandemic is reckless,” he said on Twitter on Tuesday.“It is a vital tool in helping us control transmission with testing vital for our future management of the virus. We would oppose any immediate withdrawal of universal testing offer.”The document will be released on the same day as the First Minister is due to provide an update to MSPs on the state of the pandemic.A Scottish Government spokesman said that Test and Protect “continues to deliver an effective public healthdespite record numbers of cases”.“As case numbers have risen, more people are being contact traced through digital channels – contact tracing resource continues to be targeted to best protect public health including ensuring our objectives of protecting the vulnerable and targeting high risk settings,” the spokesman said, who added the Scottish Government would publish its strategy on how it will deal with the coming stages of the pandemic later this month.Meanwhile, the Scottish Lib Dems called for more action on long Covid, after recent figures showed about % of people who reported having suffered lasting effects of the virus being referred to a Government-funded support scheme.Following an exchange between the First Minister and leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland – the charity who deliver the service – said it was a “missed opportunity” that GPs could not automatically refer to the scheme.Ahead of the First Minister’s statement, Mr Cole-Hamilton said: “The charity want to see the First Minister ensure that automatic referrals are put in place across the county so that sufferers don’t miss out. She should use her statement to announce those changes.”The Scottish Government spokesman said: “While data sharing agreements are a matter for NHS Boards and the organisations that they are collaborating with, and cannot be mandated by the Scottish Government, we have offered our support to facilitate engagement between NHS Boards and Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland to help overcome any issues.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Populations became more economically resilient, he said.The cost of using the Faroese tunnels was at first around the same as a ferry journey but over time as usage increased, tolls were slashed to less than a fth of that.Now, Mr Lamhauge said the debate was about whether to cut the tolls altogether.The meeting also heard questions from pupils at Mid Yell and Whalsay schools as well as input from some of the  or so people viewing the debate.Among the biggest subjects for debate was where would the first tunnel be builtMr Lamhauge said it took around  years to get such projects going.The Shetland Times.Here in Norway toll roads is common to finance such projects#get the funding from the Scottish Gov and get on with it.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Credit: Kevin Scott   Belfast Ralph HewittTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailHolyland residents have instructed a Belfast law firm to consider taking immediate legal action against the PSNI, the Department for Justice and the city council in an effort to stop anti-social behaviour in the area.Phoenix Law’s Darragh Mackin confirmed a number of residents in the south Belfast area are looking to “challenge the current regime in place”.The Holyland area has been plagued for years by anti-social behaviour from both young people and a minority of university students moving into the area.Almost  young people gathered for a street party during Freshers’ Week in September, resulting in three arrests and more than , bottles of alcohol being confiscated by police.The PSNI increased patrols in the Holyland during Freshers’ Week and St Patrick’s Day, handing out a number of Covid notices. But the problems continued to persist.Police were also investigating an incident in October where footage on social media appeared to show a group of iniduals throwing a plant pot at a resident’s car.Phoenix Law partner Mr Mackin stressed the potential legal action is aimed at protecting permanent residents in the area by ensuring safeguards are in place.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “This is not a situation whereby it is residents against students as often inferred,” he told the Belfast . “In fact, it is the very opposite. The reality is the residents have been, and continue to be, let down by the ineffective practices and procedures in place to protect those iniduals who live in the area.“It is the worst kept secret that there continues to be illegal occupation of multiple person properties with little or no review or investigation.“Further, the area continues to produce high levels of anti-social behaviour with limited and intermittent policing response.”Mr Mackin added that residents have been left to fend for themselves “for too long”. “We are now instructed to consider immediate legal action against both the council, the department and the PSNI for failing to ensure the necessary protections and safeguards are in place for those residents who we represent,” he stated.Long-time residents’ campaigner Brid Ruddy, who is one of the Holyland residents involved in the case, welcomed the expected legal action. She agreed with Mr Mackin that the issues in the area are not “a tussle” between dfering lestyles of residents and students, but a failure by relevant agencies to put an end to noise complaints, fly-tipping, anti-social behaviour and houses of multiple occupancy .“Yes, a lot of the anti-social behaviour comes from a minority of students who are a disgrace to the student body, because not all students are like that, but the cause of it is the total failure by the agencies to really look after this area,” stated Ms Ruddy.“It has been left to degenerate into an HMO slum.”Reflecting on the trouble within the Holyland over the past year, Ms Ruddy said it never gets any better and now occurs seven days a week. She added that people go to the area to party because “they know there will be no repercussions” and said the “absurdity of it all” was highlighted when a communal Christmas tree installed by residents was stolen in early December.“The police and council just keep saying they’re working in partnership models with others,” said Ms Ruddy. “The partnership model doesn’t work. We can’t keep on doing the same thing and expecting a dferent result.”The PSNI, Belfast City Council and the Department for Justice all said they have not received any correspondence relating to legal proceedings.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandBelfast City CouncilDepartment of JusticeMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandOnline sexual abuse crimes in Northern Ireland rose by over % in previous three years - new PSNI figures revealPSNI appeal after several people held over man’s murder are released on bailEight members of notorious UDA murder gang were police informants, says Police OmbudsmanNineteen PSNI officers suspended amid sexual misconduct investigationsAntrim man doused with heating oil during arson attack on his homeMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavour‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont departmentTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland Secretary rules out early Stormont electionNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis rules out early Stormont electionShay McCartan’s best is yet to come, insists Glentoran manager Mick McDermottVan Morrison announces two shows in Belfast’s LimelightDown boss Ronan Sheehan calls for GAA probe into alleged sectarian abuse of his team by Carlow playersLatestViewpointOpinionOur pitch to be co-host of Euros looks appealingChris Whitty tells NHS staff it is their professional responsibility to get jabsNorthern Ireland Secretary rules out early Stormont electionDean Smith: Norwich have to be streetwise in survival bidPCA admits failings over Azeem Rafiq racism allegations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We will only fix that by speaking to the UK Government and to the EU, to get them to understand that feast or famine, to fix the problems that we’ve got.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up All other parties bar the TUV have criticised the DUP’s move, in particular as it means victims and survivors of historical institutional abuse will not receive the planned formal apology from the First and Deputy First Ministers.Sinn Fein’s former Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The DUP’s actions in unilaterally resigning from the Executive are reckless and they’ve caused concern and uncertainty for businesses, for workers, for families and campaigners on a range of many important issues.“In terms of the victims of historical institutional abuse, it has caused real hurt and trauma.“And while the DUP must bear responsibility for that, I’m also very conscious that those of us who are serious about showing responsible leadership and delivering for people can and should seek to salvage what we can from the chaos the DUP have caused.”DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he was surprised other parties couldn’t see the role they played in the First Minister’s resignation.“Because we had a debate in this chamber some time ago when the SDLP, Sinn Fein, Alliance and Green Party all called for the rigorous implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol,” he added.“Now, we got a report from the EU Commission some weeks ago that was put in the Assembly library, which indicates what the rigorous implementation of the protocol is. That for some years those people who would be travelling back from ious parts of the world through Aldergrove Airport would have seen a notice about bringing food in, or anything from third countries, what they’re supposed to do.“And the EU are expecting us to do that on food coming in from Britain. Now, how many planes, how many trucks, how many cars are coming in from Great Britain to Northern Ireland every day “And the EU are demanding that we go in and ask people to open their suitcases, to open their bags, andthere’s a few mandarin oranges that they bought for the children on the way home on the ferry, that’s an at-risk item.”Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson won’t be visiting Northern Ireland imminently, following calls from DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to do so amid the political crisis.Downing Street said Mr Johnson was monitoring the situation at Stormont closely, but there were no plans for the PM to travel over.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartySinn FéinNorthern Ireland AssemblySDLPNI ProtocolPaul GivanMichelle O#NeillTraditional Unionist VoiceEdwin PootsBoris JohnsonMore On Ulster Unionist PartyBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks move PremiumLisa SmythOpinionNow it’s up to one man to find a way out of the Covid rules tangleStormont crisis: We must salvage what we can from the chaos caused by reckless DUP, says Michelle O#Neill PremiumJon TongeOpinionGambling with future of NI politics will never pay off PremiumGrassroots unionists back my calls: DonaldsonMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavour‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont departmentTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandVan Morrison announces two shows in Belfast’s LimelightDown boss Ronan Sheehan calls for GAA probe into alleged sectarian abuse of his team by Carlow playersDUP leader Donaldson denies ‘collusion’ between party and Government over legislation aiming to protect Assembly from future collapseCasement Park’s redevelopment holds the key to Northern Ireland playing their full part at Euro Jamie Mulgrew offers no excuses as he urges Linfield team-mates to get title challenge back on trackLatestExpect four-hour delays at Dover but overall picture is positive – haulage bossMauritius delegation sets sail to press claim for Chagos IslandsVan Morrison announces two shows in Belfast’s LimelightJustice Minister vows to deliver more than  domestic violence refuge bedsDown boss Ronan Sheehan calls for GAA probe into alleged sectarian abuse of his team by Carlow players,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

will not fundamentally alter the Government’s determination to carry on engaging with the Commission to find resolution, to find solutions to the situation in Northern Ireland, recognising the uniqueness of the position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom single market but also buttressing against the single market of the European Union in the form of the Irish Republic,” Mr

his closest friends in the House of Commons, to serve in the Northern Ireland Office, you could take as a declaration of his interest and commitment to Northern Ireland.“I don’t want to diminish what

Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press Eye FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealth Minister Robin Swann. Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press EyeFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailJust a few weeks ago, the Executive announced the relaxation of a raft of Covid- safety measures and promised more were on the way.Describing his delight at the development, former First Minister Paul Givan said he hoped the Executive would be in a position to review remaining restrictions this Thursday.Read MoreRobin Swann hopes to lt Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland but warns ‘both hands tied behind back’ on health reform“The February  date will be an important meeting now for those outstanding measures that are still in place,” he said. In particular, he said he wanted to see the removal of the controversial Covid certicate scheme: “The DUP has been opposed to its introduction, today we’ve made big progress in reducing its application and I want to see further progress.”Throughout the pandemic, a number of DUP members have been high-profile opponents to many of the Covid restrictions — think Sammy Wilson describing face coverings as muzzles and Paul Frew leading the charge against offering vaccinations to children and mandatory vaccination of healthcare workers.DUP politicians have increasingly raised concerns about the effects of restrictions on the economy, apparently keen to lt the measures as soon as possible.However, following Mr Givan’s resignation, it has been left to Robin Swann to find a way to lt remaining restrictions as hospitalisations and deaths linked to the virus begin to drop.Despite all its previous posturing about the damage being caused by the Covid restrictions, it appears the fight to rid Northern Ireland of the Protocol is the priority for the DUP.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As a result, Mr Swann, like all remaining ministers, is having to navigate a unique environment at Stormont. Firstly, he has to ascertain whether he can remove restrictions without the collective support of the Executive.Then,he gets the green light, it has to be established how this can be achieved. But the headache doesn’t stop there — as Mr Swann pointed out on Monday, Northern Ireland is finally moving out of the latest Covid- surge. With fewer people requiring hospital treatment for a Covid infection, it seemed like NI was inching closer to the point where it could begin the long and onerous task of rebuilding our decimated health service.So, last week’s decision by the DUP to remove Mr Givan from his post has been a hammer blow to the thousands of NHS staff crippled by the ravages of the pandemic and the hundreds of thousands of people waiting for hospital treatment.When Mr Swann on Monday said “our health service urgently needs an end to political point scoring”, he was absolutely right.An inclination to put votes before support for much-needed reform has already caused untold damage to the health service, while waiting lists spiralled after the Assembly collapsed in .Mr Swann had the unenviable task of tackling the issue and he admitted on Monday that it was going to be a signicant challenge. Yet now he is not only in a position where he will be solely responsible for bringing to an end Covid restrictions so detested by many, but, as hundreds of thousands of people languish on hospital waiting lists, he will be able to blame the current political instability for their suffering too.Related topicsRobin SwannThe Executive OfficePaul GivanUlster Unionist PartyPaul FrewMore On Robin SwannSignicant danger from Covid- over ‘to a degree’, claims senior Northern Ireland medic PremiumViewpointOpinionNorthern Ireland’s health at risk after broken vowsCovid-: what are the remaining restrictions in Northern Ireland Robin Swann hopes to lt Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland but warns ‘both hands tied behind back’ on health reformHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavour‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont departmentTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland Secretary rules out early Stormont electionNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis rules out early Stormont electionShay McCartan’s best is yet to come, insists Glentoran manager Mick McDermottVan Morrison announces two shows in Belfast’s LimelightDown boss Ronan Sheehan calls for GAA probe into alleged sectarian abuse of his team by Carlow playersLatestViewpointOpinionOur pitch to be co-host of Euros looks appealingChris Whitty tells NHS staff it is their professional responsibility to get jabsNorthern Ireland Secretary rules out early Stormont electionDean Smith: Norwich have to be streetwise in survival bidPCA admits failings over Azeem Rafiq racism allegations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A lot of people drive down and park on the beach. It was meant to be after high tide,” she said.“We have enough experience on that beach – you think we’d know better, but we walked up to go and get a coffee and the waves were coming right in, past the coffee area right at the top there.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “All the cars were getting completely swamped, there were a few animal baskets getting dragged away, luckily there were no animals in there, all animals were safe.“It was just crazy.“There were a group of ladies going in for a swim and a few of us were a bit concerned. We were saying ‘Be careful, maybe don’t go in or,you are, maybe don’t go too deep’. Then that surge came in, just before they went into the water, thank goodness, it would have been enough to take them off their feetthey had been in.”Anna said people need to be wary of strong currents.“The pull is so strong back out again,” she added.“That is why we have been putting up messages on social media for people to stay out of the water oryou are going into the water make sure you do an appropriate risk assessment and don’t go in far. I would just say don’t go in, to be honest.“When you first drive down you don’t think it is so bad but the waves out far are really big and they are breaking really big.“We drove round to Portstewart as well and because the waves are breaking so close to shore you can see the size of them.“I know the reports are that it is going to be building all day. Hopefully the surges won’t be coming up quite as far with the tide going out.”Locals said the surging waves can happen frequently.A spokesperson for Maritime and Coast Guard Control based in Bangor said further wave surges were expected into the afternoon yesterday, but the worst had passed.They encouraged the public not to put themselves into danger attempting to capture any photographs, never to turn their back on waves and to “stay high and stay dry”, by keeping away from dangerous and rough sea conditions.Most ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavour‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaHolyland residents instruct Belfast law firm to take legal action against PSNI, council and Stormont departmentTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandVan Morrison announces two shows in Belfast’s LimelightDown boss Ronan Sheehan calls for GAA probe into alleged sectarian abuse of his team by Carlow playersLoyalist Communities Council tells UUP to ‘act like unionists’DUP leader Donaldson denies ‘collusion’ between party and Government over legislation aiming to protect Assembly from future collapseCasement Park’s redevelopment holds the key to Northern Ireland playing their full part at Euro LatestExpect four-hour delays at Dover but overall picture is positive – haulage bossMauritius delegation sets sail to press claim for Chagos IslandsVan Morrison announces two shows in Belfast’s LimelightJustice Minister vows to deliver more than  domestic violence refuge bedsDown boss Ronan Sheehan calls for GAA probe into alleged sectarian abuse of his team by Carlow players,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

calls from some Stormont parties.Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Mr Lewis said it is right that the election date remains May .Following the resignation of Paul Givan as First Minister and the collapse of the Executive last week, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said Mr Lewis should bring forward the Assembly election.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson did not specically call for one but said his party were ready to fight an election.Other parties however rejected the idea of an early election, with fears that essential legislation could be stymiedStormont goes into an early period of purdah.Mr Lewis said it was already close enough to the current election period.The Assembly under the new rules can continue to , it#s right we allow MLAs time and space to pass legislation, I#ll be

resolved ahead of Stormont electionEarly Stormont election push follows condemnation of resignation of Paul GivanMeanwhile, a Northern Ireland Office minister has said the resignation of Northern Ireland#s first minister will not fundamentally alter the UK#s negotiations with the EU over the Brexit protocol.Conor Burns also repeated the Government#s call for the DUP to reinstate a first minister following the removal of Paul Givan over what the DUP regards as a lack of progress in negotiations to tackle issues with the protocol.I have to say very candidly that the Government is clear on our intentions with thecommission on the protocol and the withdrawal of the first minister will not fundamentally alter the Government#s determination to carry on engaging with the commission to find resolution, to find solutions to the situation in Northern Ireland, recognising the uniqueness of the position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom single market but also buttressing against the single market of the European Union in the form of the Irish Republic, he told the Northern Ireland Affairs committee.From a UK Government point of view, in terms of protocol conversations, the plan is clear and the plan is continuing to be played out led by the Foreign Secretary.Mr Burns said the Government profoundly regrets the withdrawal of the first minister and have urged the DUP to get the first minister back in.He said we#ve been here before, but added there is a fundamental dference to the position now as ministers are still in place and the Assembly is still sitting.We have not actually witnessed a collapse of the institutions in the way they had before, he said, adding he noted a degree of positioning ahead of the Assembly elections.He said he believed there would be a very dferent reaction from partiesthey were two or more years away from the next election.Related topicsBrandon LewisMore On Brandon LewisNIO’s office move to city centre

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task. It will be consulted on any designations or proposals by government or local government relating to the area, including the marine nature reserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Gibney’s Hoops double  ","story":"IT was a case of what could have been for Killough, as Celtic Bhoys capitalised on opportunities to stay in the race for the title on Saturday.From the refereersquos first whistle it was a heated event at Ballyhornan with both sides looking to grab possession.The advantage of the wind was with Celtic Bhoys in the first half, and it was a minor error by Killough goalkeeper, James Crangle, in the fourth minute that gted Jay Gibney his first goal of the game.Cranglersquos kick out went direct to the striker and Gibney made no mistake with his finish.The Killough players looked more driven by this and showed great character supporting their goalkeeper to get his head back into the game. Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation.

Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help. But dferent things are stirring memories. We hope to provide counselling and complementary therapy sessions in Newcastle within a few months.Sandra is recruiting a Health and Wellbeing caseworker who would be based in Killough but would also work in the Newcastle area and stressed that all services were provided on a confidential basis.One of the trustees of the Kinder Project, local man Dr Finbar McCormick, is delighted that the building is being used by Wave.ldquoKinder was a Dutch charity that took children from troubled areas to Holland in the s and then established a local centre in Killough for breaks, he explained. ldquoChildren from other troubled spots like Kosovo and the Balkans were also taken for holidays here over the years.ldquoWith the peace process, the need for the Kinder House just fell away and we were looking for another group to pass it onto so that they could make good use of it.ldquoI happened to meet Peter, who I know, one day while out for a walk and I said to him that we really needed to find another group to use the hostel. Peter said that he would mention it to Wave and that was about  months and Wave has been using it for the last six months.ldquoIt was an excellent choice for us as we really wanted to keep the place going and Wave will continue the same aims that Kinder had.To apply for the caseworker position or to access services, visit Wave www.wavetraumacentre.org.uk or ring   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo set for Croker  ","story":"KILCOO are officially back to back All-Ireland Senior Club Championship finalists after a gruelling clash with Cork side, St Finbarrrsquos, was dramatically settled in extra-time on Saturday.In a thoroughly entertaining contest that had twist after twist, Mickey Moranrsquos men eventually booked their place to contend for the Andy Merrigan Cupwhich has agonisingly eluded the local outfit over the last few years.With the headlines seemingly written in the dying seconds of regulation time, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin steadied his frame to send the deciding free between the posts.However, a moment of off-the-ball madness from team-mate Aidan Branagan resulted in a sending off and a further  minutes of added drama.Despite this, the Magpies showed their stamina and experience within this competition and managed to finish comfortably five points adrt from their opponents.The scene was set at a mild Portlaoise venue as sunshine attempted to split through the clouds and past the overshadowing OrsquoMoore Park spectator stands where the Ulster and Munster champions prepared to lock horns.Although the local side won referee Brendan Cawleyrsquos throw-in, it would be The Barrrsquos who would open the scoring from a Cillian Myers-Murray effort.Kilcoo replied rapidly through the reliable Ryan Johnston, who navigated his way past the opposing defence to curl one over the bar to level the tie.The Magpies would soon be soaring when they immediately turned over possession and saw an opportunity for the first goal of the match.Jerome Johnston cleverly spotted his brother, Ryan, and played a quick hand pass into his path where he made no mistake in burying his effort into the top left corner of the net beyond the ing Barrrsquosrsquo custodian, John Kerins.Despite this early blow, the Cork-based outfit remained determined and went on the offensive.Eoin McGreevy took the mark and kicked over before receiving a yellow card for a high tackle on Ryan Johnston.Kilcoorsquos Conor Laverty was rewarded for his tireless work ethic in the form of winning a free, although team-mate Paul Devlin saw his effort uncharacteristically drt wide from what was a very straightforward chance.Colin Lyons was the latest to enter Cawleyrsquos book with  minutes played following a late tackle on Niall Branagan that left the Kilcoo number two worse for wear.Steven Sherlock successfully converted his first of ten frees for The Barrrsquos to bring his side to within a point, but Laverty answered this with a score from play to widen the winning margin once more.St Finbarrrsquos were notably the physically bigger side and it was clear they were initiating a rougher style of play.This was evident after Sherlock again split the posts from a free, when Kilcoorsquos Ceilum Doherty looked to reply and instead was clattered by defender Sam Ryan.This time, Devlin made no mistake with his attempt which would have helped settle his nerves from his earlier miss.Sherlock pointed his third free of the match in retaliation in what was now a tit for tat contest.However, The Barrrsquos managed to swing the tie hugely in their favour when Kilcoorsquos Daryl Branagan forfeited possession close to his goal and the onrushing Eoin Comyns took full advantage.The Barrrsquos number nine quickly passed to team-mate Sherlock, who set up McGreevy for their sidersquos first goal of the match.Despite the efforts of Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, McGreevy managed to creep his shot round the custodian to fire his team into the lead minutes before half-time.With seconds to the interval, Denis OrsquoBrien received a yellow to join the growing list of his St Finbarrrsquos team-mates to go into the refereersquos book.As the whistle sounded, both sides engaged in some roughhousing as tensions reached fever pitch.Half time: St Finbarrrsquos - Kilcoo -.The Barrrsquos won the second half throw-in and went on the attack through a surging Sherlock run that resulted in a free - which he duly converted.This sprung The Magpies into action with rising star Shealan Johnston running past three defenders before kicking over the bar for a magnicent solo point. Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

The tactic looked like paying off, but at the post So Ladylike, with Caoimhe OrsquoBrien in the saddle, got up to provide the rider with her second success, her first coming on this Alana McGuinness-owned runner back in October. Ballinasilla finished a close third.The winner is trained by Ian Donoghue, a brother of top Northern Ireland jockey Keith, who is no longer with Gordon Elliott.Only six of the  entries took part in the Dennison JCB Maiden Race for five year-old geldings, but the race provided spectators with a close finish.The Aaron Sinnott-ridden Song For My Father, owned and trained in Co Cavan by Shane Donohoe, just passed the judge ahead of Time For A Pint, ridden by Tom Hamilton for Co Carlow trainer Shark Hanlon, with Hapy La Vie back in third ahead of Old Style Humor.It was not long before a stewardsrsquo enquiry was called with the result that the winner was disqualied for failing to draw the correct weight. Time For A Pint was placed first ahead of Hapy La Vie and Old Style Humor .Four set out in the Kingsfield Stud five year-old Mares Maiden Race, but only three remained after the fourth fence, after Paddy Cleary lost his irons and was unseated.This left Born Famous to win from Famous Function and local hope Social Distancing. For trainer Claire OrsquoConnell it was a welcome winner. Paul Bannon was the successful rider.The Cosy Roof Open Race saw the grey Creadan Grae make most of the running but in the end had to be content with second to the ex-English trained Brain Power mdash a rare open horse for Warren Ewing, who is best known for producing top four year-olds.The successful rider was Maghera-based Oran McGill who was replacing his injured younger brother Dara. Warren is part of the well known fish merchant family. Third home was Bajan Excell, ridden by Ben OrsquoBrien.The connections of the runner-up in this race, Broughshane owner Philip McBurney, rider Noel McParlan and trainer Gerry Quinn, also based at Broughshane, had better fortune in the Armstrong Auctions  year-old and Upwards Mares Maiden when Tamlaght Eyes, pulled up in her previous three races, proved to be the smooth winner from the Lee Shawagen-ridden Any Time with Castle Arms Casa a very close third.The final race on the card was the G Curran  Co Ltd Maiden Race for  year-old and Upwards Geldings. Ask Charlie was the easy winner from Kilmoganny, ridden by Tiernan Power-Roche, and Robbie Armstrongrsquos ex-English trained Carolersquos Templer, ridden by Deckie Lavery.Good to see the long established Denis Reddan colours in the winning enclosure. Ridden by Ben Harvey, the winner is trained by his father, William.Perhaps the result may have been dferent had Paul Bannon not become unseated at the final fence of his mount Butcher Barry.Best turned out in all races as usual was courtesy of Glencairn Stables.Acting stewards: Rev Colin Hall-Thompson, Max and Margaret Evine and David Aiken.Ballee jockey Toni Quail, out of action with a broken ankle as a result of a schooling accident, was helping with declarations at the meeting.A tribute was paid to the late Maurice King who for many years was a vet at the meeting.The next meeting at Tyrella is on Saturday, March .

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We met local women traders and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as MPs from countries across Africa and other key figures. There were lots of discussions about how they view the UK and our mutual partnerships going forward, how we tackle global challenges, and how we fight for human rights and gender justice together.After arriving back in the early hours, I was then straight back into Westminster for anFriday sitting in Parliament – a very important one – as I joined other MPs to support my colleague Rosie Cooper MP’s British Sign Language Bill, which aims to make BSL an official language of the UK.I had a chance to thank local BSL interpreters and deaf community activists, saying: “I add my wholehearted support to this Bill.

She should use her statement to announce those changes.”The Scottish Government spokesman said: “While data sharing agreements are a matter for NHS Boards and the organisations that they are collaborating with, and cannot be mandated by the Scottish Government, we have offered our support to facilitate engagement between NHS Boards and Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland to help overcome any issues.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Tories suggest scrapping Covid contact tracing as part of  u to normality u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Currently the Northern Ireland Executive can’t meet following the resignation of First Minister, Paul Givan, last week. The last remaining restrictions were due to be discussed at an Executive meeting on Thursday. However, Mr Swann said he was not prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lting now unnecessary restrictions. I am now seeking that legal guidance on how I myself can replace the bulk of the remaining restrictions,not all of them, with clear guidance and advice, he said on Monday afternoon. When we had an executive, ministers always said we wouldnt retain restrictions for a day longer than necessary, so that same logic should still apply. While we must move forward carefully, we cant stay locked in emergency restrictions forever. We need to start getting normal back.
