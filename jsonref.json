With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th. If Ireland votes No, the Eight Amendment will remain.

Princess Michael of Kent (left) prides herself on being both a well-organised and generous hostess. While his wife stands graciously saying ‘hello’ to everyone, Prince Michael minglesThis is the garden that was once Princess Diana’s sanctuary, the only place where she felt entirely secure from Buckingham Palace snoops, and where Prince William took his first public steps.Since taking it over after Diana’s death, Princess Michael, 73, has transformed the place, and the flowerbeds and roses will be at their best for the party on July 2, two days before her husband’s 76th birthday.There is an added ingredient to this summer’s bash — the couple are also celebrating their ruby wedding anniversary on June 30. So there will be special interest in who makes the guest list.The bank holiday getaway heats up!

There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company. They do, however, have a small weekend cottage in Gloucestershire.

Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/16/4CA5493E00000578-5774789-image-m-31_1527348431493.jpg","title":"Back reality Meghan Markles mother Doria takes dog walk L A","story":"    Doria Ragland was pictured on Friday in Los Angeles as she took her dog for a walk       EXCLUSIVE: Coldstream Guard \u0027raped young mother\u0027 in a park...Prince Charles steps out in a trendy pair of shades as he...Share this articleMs Ragland was also the only one of the actress\u0027s relatives who was seen at the wedding last week. She accompanied her in a car to the chapel at Windsor Castle then watched on, blinking away tears, as Meghan and Harry said their vows.    Ms Ragland returned to California this week after accompanying her daughter throughout the weekend in Windsor           Ms Ragland is one of the few members of the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s family who has not embarrassed her since she became engaged to Prince Harry  Afterwards, in a touching gesture of hospitality after their children tied the knot, Prince Charles accompanied her out of the church and then took her arm on the steps of the chapel to pose for photographs with his own wife, The Duchess of Cornwall. Ms Ragland\u0027s dignified silence about the royal romance is in stark contrast to the headline-grabbing insults thrown around by Meghan\u0027s half-siblings. It also coincides with her father\u0027s staging of paparazzi photographs in Mexico. After the wedding last Saturday, Ms Ragland joined her daughter and hundreds of other guests at a lunch in Windsor Castle.

There could be a few very short-lived thunderstorms but overall it will be a much quieter night.\u0027Southern England was struck by lightning between 15,000 and 20,000 times on Saturday night into Sunday morning.Mr Snell said: \u0027It all depends how much cloud develops. There\u0027s a chance we could see the warmest day of the year. It will be quite widely into the 20s across many parts of the UK. For a bank holiday Monday, it\u0027s not looking too bad.\u0027Further thundery downpours might appear in the late afternoon – not everyone will see them but if you do see one they could be quite nasty. The areas worst hit on Sunday might escape.\u0027Scotland would see the most prolonged sunshine, he said, but most areas would start dry and cloud cover quickly burn off. Pictured: Storms over the Isle of Wight. A cluster of 17 flood alerts has been issued for parts of the Thames Valley, while West Midlands and Bedfordshire fire services warned motorists of the risks of driving on flood-hit roads          The 62,000 strikes contained 15million kWh of energy - enough to boil water for 600million cups of tea, lightning and energy data showed.

The suspects in this matter are unknown as yet\u0027.Justin and his family have just three lions left now but have 10 tigers and two caracals and a wolf who were all rescued and given new lives and he has set up a donations page to help them rescue more big cats.Donations to help the Jugomaro Predator Park can me made here.

allows you to rent out canoesIn 1954, it was where Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum filmed River of No Return. An enclave of luxury accommodation at the heart of Jasper National Park, the site boasts a series of elegant log cabins.In the pristine forested surroundings of the lodge\u0027s spa, any recent bride can soothe away the stresses of a Royal Wedding (and accompanying family woes).

article    Sergio Mattarella vetoed the appointment of Paolo Savona (pictured) who has described the euro as a \u0027German cage\u0027 and said that Italy needs a plan to leave the single currency \u0027if necessary\u0027The euro, bonds and stocks initially rallied on Monday after President Sergio Mattarella vetoed Savona\u0027s nomination, but relief turned to fear over snap elections. The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields, a measure of Italian risk, widened to its highest in over four years.\u0027The election is going to resemble a referendum, de facto, on the European Union and the euro,\u0027 said Francesco Galietti, head of political risk consultancy Policy Sonar in Rome. \u0027It\u0027s an existential threat for the entire euro zone.\u0027If Italians were to cast a protest vote against the EU and euro at fresh elections, it would deliver the bloc\u0027s biggest challenge since Britain voted to quit the union two years ago and raise questions about the future of the single currency.As the euro zone\u0027s third-largest economy, heavily indebted Italy also represents a far bigger potential threat to the single currency than the Greek economic crisis.Polls show the League has gained support since winning 17 percent of the vote in inconclusive March 4 elections, climbing as high as 24 percent. The 5-Star has been drawing about the same 32 percent it got two months ago.Former prime minister Massimo D\u0027Alema, caught speaking on an open microphone on Saturday, summed up the fears of traditional parties: \u0027If we go back to elections because of a veto on Savona, they (anti-establishment parties) are going to win 80 percent.\u0027On the street, some voters believe Salvini is right to challenge the president\u0027s veto and go back to the polls.\u0027I\u0027m really ticked off. The president sold out the country,\u0027 said Giancarlo Sacco, 54, owner of a cafe in central Rome. Sacco said he wanted Italy to remain in the euro but that its concerns needed to be taken seriously by EU partners.\u0027It just has to make itself respected again.\u0027The president\u0027s veto of Savona as economy minister has put the currency, which was little discussed in the last election campaign, at the centre of the debate.\u0027Membership of the euro is a fundamental choice,\u0027 Mattarella said in a televised speech, explaining his veto. \u0027If we want to discuss it, then we should do so in a serious fashion.\u0027In February, Salvini railed against the euro, saying it was a \u0027mistake for our economy\u0027.\u0027We don\u0027t have a euro in our pockets. We have a German mark which they called the euro,\u0027 he said.The 5-Star dropped its previous calls for a non-binding referendum over Italy\u0027s euro membership, though its founder, comic Beppe Grillo, recently revived the idea.Political tensions are running high, with the League threatening street protests against Mattarella.On social media, League and 5-Star sympathisers made death threats against the president, while supporters crowding around Salvini and Di Maio during live TV interviews late on Sunday shouted insults at him.On the other side are Italians who, like many Britons devastated by the Brexit vote, see the country\u0027s relationship with Europe as fundamental.\u0027I am absolutely pro-European and I believe that Italy is connected, must have a connection with Europe for our future,\u0027 said Irene Teramo, a shopper at a street market in Rome, who supported the president\u0027s decision.Italians will also be weighing concern about their savings as financial markets put the country\u0027s stock market and bonds under pressure and borrowing costs increase.\u0027In his heart, the average voter will probably be cheering for the anti-establishment forces, but his wallet will be saying the opposite,\u0027 said political risk expert Galietti.\u0027It will be a heart versus wallet election.\u0027                                                     \u0027I will come to parliament with a programme that, if I win the vote of confidence, will include a vote on the 2019 budget. Then parliament will be dissolved, with elections at the start of 2019,\u0027 Cottarelli told reporters after meeting Mattarella.But he added that if, as is likely, his government is not approved by parliament, new elections will be held \u0027after August\u0027.He will struggle to gain the approval of parliament with Five Star and the League commanding a majority in both houses.    The current President Sergio Mattarella refused to appoint a eurosceptic finance minister, even though he was the choice of the prime minister-designate and had the backing of the majority of parliamentariansAfter winning elections in 1994, the media magnate, who was already in the crosshairs of the Italian justice system, proposed to president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to nominate his personal lawyer Cesare Previti as Minister of Justice.Scalfaro refused and Berlusconi accepted defeat.This time, the Italian populists have refused to accept that the country\u0027s head of state is simply exercising his prerogative, instead denouncing what they claim is meddling by Brussels or financial lobbyists.It is on this basis that Di Maio has raised the possibility of impeaching Mattarella for treason - something that would require an absolute majority in both chambers of parliament in a joint session.The president has very limited powers but can appoint heads of government and their chosen ministers.The constitution also gives the president the power to dissolve parliament, a deterrent force which has played a part in numerous prior political crises in Italy - a country which has had 64 governments since 1946.During the financial crisis in 2011, when global markets turned on Italy, President Giorgio Napolitano supported a move to oust Silvio Berlusconi and replace him with former European Commissioner Mario Monti.Berlusconi denounced what he said was a state coup and demanded early elections - but in vain.The League and M5S had also called for early elections after Italians voted no in a 2016 referendum on constitutional reform - prompting the departure of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi - but Mattarella refused to dissolve parliament.                                                               Mr Conte (pictured) who has no political experience, received the mandate last week from the pro-European Mr Mattarella, but talks failed The president said Conte refused to support \u0027any other solution\u0027 and then, faced with Mattarella\u0027s refusal to approve the choice of Savona, gave up his mandate to be prime minister.The leaders of Five Star and the League, Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, were infuriated by Mattarella\u0027s refusal to accept Savona, a respected financier and economist.Salvini, who was Savona\u0027s biggest advocate and a fellow eurosceptic, said on Sunday that Italy wasn\u0027t a \u0027colony\u0027, and that \u0027we won\u0027t have Germany tell us what to do\u0027.\u0027Why don\u0027t we just say that in this country it\u0027s pointless that we vote, as the ratings agencies, financial lobbies decide the governments,\u0027 a livid Di Maio said in a video on Facebook.Later on Italian television he called for impeaching Mattarella.\u0027I hope that we can give the floor to Italians as soon as possible, but first we need to clear things up. First the impeachment of Mattarella... then to the polls,\u0027 Di Maio said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/27/13/056E3C1F000003E8-0-image-m-27_1527424642869.jpg","title":"Coca Cola launches alcoholic drink","story":"    Coca-Cola has launched its first ever alcoholic drink in Japan - a fizzy, lemon-flavoured concoction laced with spirits and aimed at young women\u0027This is a pilot project in the region which has a sizable market,\u0027 Masaki Iida, spokesman for Coca-Cola\u0027s Japanese unit, told AFP.He declined to reveal the exact spirit in the drink, as the recipe is a closely guarded secret.Salford is revealed as alcoholic capital of England where...\u0027Shambolic\u0027 security guards are accused of failing to search...Unlicensed and drunk female driver with an \u0027abysmal\u0027 record...Share this articleCoca Cola product developers got the idea after visiting Japanese-style \u0027izakaya\u0027 pubs, where they discovered that lemon-flavoured drinks are very popular, according to the firm\u0027s website.The popular \u0027chuhai\u0027 drinks - which contain vodka or a distilled, grain-based spirit called \u0027shochu\u0027 - come in a range of flavours such as grape, strawberry, kiwi and white peach.They range in strength from between three and nine percent and are particularly popular with young drinkers, especially women.Coca-Cola is wading into an already competitive market, where major Japanese companies such as Suntory, Kirin and Asahi dominate the shelves.And the firm\u0027s president has already dampened hopes of people hoping to get a tipple outside Japan, saying there are no plans to launch \u0027Lemon-Do\u0027 outside of the country.However, the push is seen as part of a broader campaign to ersify beyond sodas as health concerns see consumers in the US and other developed markets weaning themselves off sweet drinks and diet colas."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/13/4CB3B22100000578-0-image-m-7_1527511399709.jpg","title":"South Yorkshire spinster 106 claims secret long life complete lack MEN","story":"    Madeline Dye, 106, has never been on a date or had a boyfriend.

There are still 40 people detained there. More than 16 years on, many of us have stopped looking. I wanted to make us look again. It took me nine months to secure permission to photograph in the detention centres and across the naval base. Shortly after I arrived, on the first of three trips, my military escort said: “Gitmo is the best posting a soldier could have. There’s so much fun here.” It was such a striking statement. So I decided to juxtapose the so-called fun of the guards’ spaces with the facilities available to prisoners. When I saw this wide-eyed smirking turtle, I knew it was perfect: the water shot I’d been looking for, an inflatable toy in a wading pool. Until I saw it, I hadn’t realised that there are children growing up on the base, their parents being either in the military or civilians working there. What must it be like to grow up there? To use the leisure facilities of a place seen as a “war-on-terror” prison site, where men are held without charge or trial, largely beyond the reach of the US courts, for years at a time? There are two very different things happening at Guantánamo and this captured that perfectly.I understand why people say it’s a scary image. There’s that expression on the turtle’s face, in this run-down enclosure, and there’s the sliver of sky, the palm trees in the distance, the lush green – but you’re not out in that tropical paradise. You’re penned off from it. What gives the shot extra power is the fact that it’s the only face in my entire series. Military regulations forbid any photographs of faces. This forced me to be more creative, to find other ways to convey the denial of personhood of Guantánamo Bay. My shots capture all the places people use – but they’re empty. DBSSt Michael’s Mount, 2017, by Martin ParrMagnumI shot this at St Michael’s Mount, just near Penzance, last August. It was a hot day, though not blazing sunshine. St Michael’s Mount is a big honey pot, absolutely mobbed every single day, and part of the manifestation of that mobbing is this wonderful queue. The British, of course, are supreme masters of queuing. And I thought it was good to get summer, beach, queuing and the island in the background, all in one photo.I watched the queue for a good period. I love how it winds round, constantly shifting. It was actually very difficult to capture it without lots of other people getting in the way. Here, I managed to get just a few scattered people “off queue”, with the rest compliantly queueing up to get the boat over to the island.I never actually got there myself, because I was too fascinated by people trying to get there. Despite global austerity, tourism is growing at a phenomenal rate. We all know the stories about places like Venice and Barcelona being almost out of control. DBSAncient tree (After Night series), 2010, by Lisa RossThe first time I ever saw a bed just sitting out in the landscape was while I was travelling through Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the far northwest of China, in a taxi. I screamed at the driver to stop so I could take a photo. I was transfixed. It was only when I returned a few days later that I realised they were everywhere. I just hadn’t noticed.Xinjiang gets extremely hot in summer so everyone sleeps outside. There are beds all over the fields, on rooftops and in front of houses. In towns, there are whole streets have beds out front. Each bed becomes a hub for the family. They eat around them and kids play on them with their friends.The bedding is rolled up during the day to keep the sand out, but when you see it unfurled it’s extraordinary. Bedding is a big wedding gift in the region, so it’s often made from the most colourful fabrics available. People couldn’t understand why I was so interested. When I asked if I could photograph their beds, they laughed. It’s just such an ordinary thing to do there.It’s the total opposite of how we treat the bed in the west. For us, the bedroom is a private space, intimate and enclosed. It’s usually the last room you’d show a guest. Here, though, it becomes a part of public life. People talk and play and see each other around their beds.This local custom has lasted longer than anyone can remember, but I don’t know if it will survive. Xinjiang is home to Uighurs, a Muslim minority who are under increasing surveillance from the Chinese government. When I first started working here, I encountered relatively few difficulties. But today, nobody knows what might be considered unacceptable. That’s why I try to keep people’s faces out of the pictures. It might cause them problems further down the line.I showed these photos to a Tibetan friend and he was amazed. He felt like it was the last uncontrolled area of China. There will probably come a time when this custom is banned. In a really important way, the beds are an expression of their autonomy, and it’s the heat of summer that brings everyone out into the open. ESI love the way New York used to look, but the city has become so corporate and homogenised. Coney Island, though, still has a cool edge. You find everyone there: tourists, locals, immigrants from Mexico, Africa, Russia. Everyone loves the magic of being on the beach in New York City! For my series Island, which I shot over the summer of 2016, I avoided any kind of landmark, though. I didn’t even include the Island’s famous Wonder Wheel. I just wanted to concentrate on the people. I saw this guy playing with his son, chasing him, throwing him in the air – and the boy, who was two or three, was loving it. The interaction between them was special. The boy’s mum was there too – it was a family day out.I asked if I could shoot them and suggested this position. Having seen they way they were together, I knew they’d be comfortable with it. The kid was laughing and giggling the whole time. It made me think about childhood, how early experiences and memories imprint themselves on us for life. I only took a few shots. It was the end of the day, when the light is soft and the blues and the yellows are strong.The father had had a tough life. That tattoo was one of several. I loved this image but he took a while to come round to it. I had to persuade him to let me publish and exhibit it because he was protective of his son. There was a really strong reaction to it. African Americans particularly like this positive image of a black father – something that we don’t see enough of. I love how the father’s face looks a certain way, but the overall image shows him as a gentle and loving father.I always talk to the people I photograph. I want to connect with them. In my work, I try to show that compassion and inclusivity are what’s important. ITThe Roof of Tehran, 2016, by Tahmineh MonzaviI took this at Bam-e-Tehran, which means “the roof of Tehran”. It is in the foothills of the Alborz mountains, close to the cable cars that take you up to Tochal ski resort. It’s essentially a plateau, enclosed by a wall made of bluish-green stone. It’s just 50cm high on the inside, but on the other side is a sheer drop. You can walk up there, along a pedestrianised road that leads to shops and restaurants. Young people gather there all year round, to sit on the wall and look out over the city. You can see all of Tehran from up there. I live close by, but had never paid it much attention until this one evening in 2016. I was working on images of Tehran for Elle magazine. It was about 7pm and the sun was setting. It wasn’t rainy but it was overcast. Tehran has four seasons and spring is the best. The weather is great and the city is magnificent. If you’re not from Iran, you might mistake this for somewhere in Egypt or Beirut. But people who live in Tehran would easily recognise the architecture, the tall and short buildings.In my work, I focus a lot on Iranians, women in particular. I try to document their lives. Gathered on the wall, I could see people of all social backgrounds: those from the lower-class neighbourhoods of south Tehran more middle-class people from the centre affluent ones from the north. Despite the chaos and the pollution, Tehranis have a huge passion for their city – and they all come together at Bam-e-Tehran. SKDFourth of July, High School Students, New Orleans, 2017, by An-my LêI moved to the US as a child and have always been struck by Independence Day: the barbecues, the lawn chairs, the flags, the parades, the people out in the street. In 2017 I was in the south, photographing confederate monuments that had recently been taken down. With Fourth of July celebrations in full swing, I thought I would find some interesting parades.We had started in Memphis, then drove further south but couldn’t find any good parades in Mississippi. So we headed to New Orleans. A lot of people had gathered in St John, a bayou within the city, to boat down the waterway or picnic on its banks. Walking around at the end of the day, as the sun was setting, I came across these incredible young women.What I noticed first was the redhead’s hair, that extraordinary colour, and then the African American girl sitting next to her, so regal. I thought of Manet’s Déjeuner sur l’herbe – this was an interesting alternate version. The image feels staged and deliberate, partly because I used a large-format camera. The longer exposure means I had to ask them to hold still. But there is also something about the way they were presenting themselves. I didn’t direct them much. The redhead was just standing that way.While I made this photograph before the shootings, it is a sort of a response to what happened at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, this year. At first glance, these three girls couldn’t seem more different, yet they are together, in that Fourth of July chaos. I wanted to capture the intimacy I sensed between them. DBSUntitled 3 (Estudio elemental del levante), 2017, by Ricardo CasesI shot this outside a restaurant in Dénia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. I was struck by the composition: the tentacles hanging down, the line of the sea going across. The locals hang octopus in the sun to dry, before serving it with a little olive oil and lemon. It’s a simple, traditional dish, not unique to the region, but ancient.On the Costa Blanca, beyond the paella and the parasols, there are so many symbols, things that carry the spirit of the place. This drying octopus is one, but so are the oranges, the palm trees, the village brass bands. And together, they form the basis of a series I’ve made about degradation in the area.On the beaches and coves of Costa Blanca not long ago, there were fishing villages, steeped in tradition. Now the old way of life has been engulfed by resorts. And with those resorts have come real problems. You can see scorched and withered palm trees everywhere. Many were imported from Egypt to decorate tourist developments during the real estate boom. But they carried the red palm weevil, the larvae of which have since devoured thousands of trees. They were eaten from within.This image of the octopus is another note in a requiem for a way of life that had its moment of delirious crazy glory, but is now sickly and decaying. It marks the end of a stage in Spain’s recent history, a moment lived with intensity and ingenuity, but one that couldn’t last. TGRicardo Cases’s solo show, Estudio elemental del levante, is at Espace JB, Geneva, until 22 June.Timeout II: LAX, USA, 2016, by Marcus LyonThis is a montage of over 1,000 images brought together in my studio. I shot them by hanging out of a chopper 1,000 metres above Los Angeles international airport early one summer morning. The work is part of a series that explores the five big preoccupations people have once safety, shelter and sustenance have taken a secondary role. These are sport, mass entertainment, cars, food consumption and mass air travel.I tried to visualise it first, sketching an airport with gates and runways that looked like a living organism with a spine and ribs. I then spent hours searching for the best airport and a pilot happy to seek permission from the control tower – and take the doors off his helicopter. One of the advantages of shooting over airports is that the air space above them is just about the most uncrowded on the planet – because all the planes are on the ground.We were in the air shooting for about two hours. I knew exactly what shots I needed. Seen from up high, the world dissolves into minutiae, patterns and rhythms. I have spent a lot of my time hanging out of helicopters so I’m much too focused on what I’m doing to stop and think about it enough to be terrified.Back in my studio, I worked for three months creating the final image, one car, one airplane at a time. It was a painstaking process. And there’s a little image of me in there – I put myself in every shot I create. It feels honest, plus it means that kids love to engage with the work. Hopefully, it will help them ask the right questions about their roles in our increasingly globalised world. ITSurfers in a barrel, 2017, by Joni SternbachWhen a big wave hits shallow water, its tip can curve right over and form a tunnel through the water. In the surfing world, this is known as a barrel. So when I saw this huge wooden structure, I thought putting a few surfers in it was probably the best pun I’d ever come up with. We were all beside ourselves laughing.At first, I had no idea how the barrel got there. The shot was taken right next to a parking lot on the California coast and there was junk strewn everywhere. Someone told me after the shoot that it was a prop in the film Sideways. I don’t know if that’s true – but it’s what I like to tell people.I’ve been shooting surfers on the California coast for over a decade now. I’m fascinated by the human connection to water. The ocean is one of the few places that doesn’t have boundaries these days. Even the ranchers who live on the surrounding hills have been enclosed and hemmed in. The sea is still free.But I can’t shoot surfers in action. I work with tintypes, a process that creates an image directly on to a thin tin plate using lacquers and emulsion that react to the light. The plate needs a long exposure, so I can’t catch people riding the waves.Using such an old process gives my shots their timeless quality, an air of nostalgia. But it also forces you to work in a really communal way. I have to set up a darkroom. People have to stay in position for a little while – and I develop the photos in front of them. They see the result there and then, telling me what they think. It can be quite nerve-racking, but it’s much more participatory.Only two of the people in this photograph knew each other. But the surf – and posing for this image – brought them together. I think that’s what summer by the sea means to me: people coming together and new communities forming, even if only for a day. ESJoni Sternbach’s solo show, Ocean Side, is at Galerie Catherine et André Hug, Paris, until 9 June.Ice lolly in the Tenderloin, 2015, by Pieter HugoI was living in San Francisco in the summer of 2015 when one day my wife called as she was dropping our daughter off at school. She told me I had to go downtown and take a look at the Tenderloin district. It’s an island of anarchy in the midst of the city’s tech boom. Most of the buildings are owned by non-profits who have no interest in selling their space to the tech giants.It’s a crazy place: if you wander through its streets, you’ll see people openly shooting up in the middle of the day. Having spent most of my life in Cape Town, South Africa, I’m used to homelessness. But what I saw in the Tenderloin was something else.In many ways, its residents are testament to the failings of American society, whether that’s people suffering under a failed healthcare policy or veterans traumatised by wars overseas. It can be pretty rough – especially at night – but there’s an extremely strong sense of community. This was the very first shot I took. When I asked if I could take her portrait, the woman immediately struck this pose, as if she was modelling. I met her a lot over the course of the summer. Every time, it was like a fashion shoot. She would ask for cash and I would usually give it to her, but we never really talked about her life story. What I love about the photograph is its oomph. She owns it.

In a military town outside Seoul, where she lived aged 11, many of the trees had been cut down for fuel, while, under the dictator Park Chung-Hee’s modernisation programme, new roads were begun and abandoned. The inhabitants of her neighbourhood’s cheap and fragile houses came and went: soldiers, farmers who worked the fields surrounding the haphazard development, and “wanderers”, such as Bul’s parents. They were leftwing activists whose home was routinely searched by the police for banned books and needed to live in a place where people weren’t too fussy about their neighbours.While the world outside was dry, however, home was a Technicolor Oz. As political dissidents, her parents couldn’t attend group gatherings, even at work. Compelled to labour from home, sometimes with neighbours, her mother made handbags from glass beads. “There was another landscape inside our house,” she recalls. “One room with women working with beautiful colours.”As origin stories go, it’s a setting worthy of the dystopian fiction Bul has long channelled in her art: sci-fi movie-spectacular sculptures and installations powered by utopian dreams and social critique. Her forthcoming mid-career survey at the Hayward Gallery in London will trace how, over the past three decades, she has established herself at the forefront of South Korean art. When we meet at the gallery a few weeks before the opening, there are cyborg babes and multi-limbed monsters hanging from the ceiling. Mirrors wrapped in cellophane lean against walls, waiting to be assembled into luminous labyrinths. Technicians are tinkering inside a high-gloss black hunk of hollow mountain that looks like a panic room for Darth Vader, but is dedicated to the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin. Throughout it all, Bul examines our flawed pursuit of perfection, be it improving our bodies, or remaking society. There’s a striking push and pull between the gorgeous and grotesque. Get up close to the darkly glittering skin of a mutant octopus creation, and you see that its sequins are matted with plant life, like something washed up in a drain.Bul thinks the strange contrasts of her formative years are central to her approach they have clearly engendered a strong ironic streak in her work. She has a formative childhood memory of lovers riding a motorbike that crashed into a bakery, in a smash of blood and cake. “That was a beautiful accident,” she laughs throatily.Her work is now highly crafted, with expensive production values. It’s a universe away from when she started out. This was 1980s Korea, where protesters faced torture, and she was working within a fledgling contemporary art scene with few international influences. “There were no role models. I had to create,” she says.Her traditional art school was a disappointment, but discovering the postwar theatre of the absurd inspired Bul to break free. Her first notable work was in 1989 a performance called Abortion, a shocking mix of real and fake. Having distributed sweets to her audience, Bul hung upside down and nude, recounting her experiences of abortion, which was then illegal, while recreating something of its physical agony. Eventually, her onlookers took action and cut the ropes: “They never thought it was theatre. It was a real body and a real situation.”The following year she took her unruly, boundary-breaking physicality to the street. Hanging from the Hayward’s rafters is a meaty, lobster-orange mutant fat suit, fingers and limbs sprouting from its fleshy folds. It’s huge – photographs can’t really convey what it must have taken the diminutive artist to don it, take a flight to Tokyo, and head downtown. “Of course, they didn’t want me on the plane,” she chuckles. “Finally, they said it’s too big and I would need two seats.” What impressed Bul, though, was how, in Tokyo, when prohibited from entering a temple because of the suit, a crowd had argued for her right to wear what she wanted: “They were thinking about human rights. It expanded my subject.” Bul’s body politics and her insistence on her presence as a woman seem especially remarkable in a society as notoriously patriarchal as Korea’s: until 2005, men were legally heads of households. However, she says that her own experiences were not so bad, for one particular reason. “People were scared of me and thought I was a crazy woman. Of course, if I didn’t use this character, then it would probably have been very difficult.” She adds, “I know so many great women artists in Korea because, when women want to be an artist they have to sacrifice everything. It’s art alone for them, so they are very, very strong.” It was after Majestic Splendor that Bul began to think about the cyborgs that would really establish her as an international star. In the 1990s they were a hot topic for writers such as William Gibson and a strong presence in manga, as cartoonishly sexualised women. Bul was one of the first to pull these creatures of sci-fi subculture into contemporary art, in a way that pointed to their age-old cultural roots. Bul’s floating marble-white cyborgs have the elevated position and missing limbs of classical sculptures, a nod to our shifting ideals of beauty and imperfection. What really fascinated her, though, was what cyborgs implied about our efforts to self-improve, in this case with technology. Thinking back to Frankenstein’s monster, she says: “We try to pursue perfection, fail, get scared and call it a monster. And still we try, because that’s our human destiny.” Bul refers to her many-tendrilled Anagram sculptures, a mash-up of insect, plant and sea-life resembling a genetic experiment gone badly wrong, as her voluptuous cyborg’s “doppelgangers”.As a child in the military town, from her house with a paper-thin door, Bul would dream about a bunker-like hideout on a mountainside. In recent years, her focus has shifted from the body to the built environment – another kind of protective skin. This includes fashioning glittering chandelier-like sculptures inspired by the modernist architect Bruno Taut’s fantasy mountaintop glass buildings and coffin-like, one-person karaoke pods that recall the 1960s architecture collective Archigram’s Living Pod. These failed or unrealised architectural dreams are a not-so distant echo of the rapid urban development South Korea was subjected to under the dictatorship, Bul says, with “fast-built cement structures and clean surfaces, but which were likely to collapse”. Disaster is never far away in her work, such as a new installation that refers to the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry, in which hundreds died. Yet Bul says she doesn’t want to criticise the impulse to dream big. “This is all about human desire, and desire is our destiny. I don’t want to judge it, but I want to see it more clearly if possible.”Bul’s work knowingly embraces the human urge to attempt impossible tasks. First, there’s the relentless drive to perfect the world, even as history teaches us such ambitions are doomed. Then there’s the challenge of understanding why we do it. One particularly telling work, Via Negative II, is inspired by psychologist Julian Jaynes, who proposed that early man misinterpreted thoughts from the right side of the brain as voices from the gods. It’s a mirrored maze where you encounter infinite reflections of yourself. “I’m trying to question the modern human with a modern mind, and I can’t find the answer,” Bul says. “My labyrinth is in two halves. In one, it’s hard to exit. The other is always open. You can escape any time. That’s my dream.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8188d2b44d0acafb099026da183ac730f53a88c9/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e40de06a69f8957493e8b97993b13f6","title":"british linguaphobia has deepened since brexit vote say experts","story":"New research shows teachers reporting that the vote to leave the EU has hardened monolingual attitudesBritain faces further isolation after Brexit if it doesn’t adjust its citizens’ attitude towards learning foreign languages, a panel of experts has warned, with Britons becoming increasingly “linguaphobic” in the wake of the EU referendum.“That English is somehow the norm is a complete misapprehension of the facts, but this notion that everyone is speaking English is persistent and believed by many in the UK,” said Gorrara, warning that economic opportunities and bridge-building with the rest of the world was at risk after Brexit if Britons did not become less “linguaphobic” and learn more languages.The same report also found that there was a “growing language deficit” in the UK, which is expected only to grow post-Brexit because the UK’s £1bn “language industry” – including services such as translation and interpreting – already heavily relies on EU citizens, whose expertise may become harder to access.Speaking at Hay, Tinsley said that in forthcoming research commissioned by the British Council, due to be published next month, a survey of around 700 modern-language teachers in England found that a third felt Brexit had resulted in a negative attitude towards learning foreign languages in their school, among both parents and pupils.Tinsley, who worked on the report, said these respondents tended to work in England’s most deprived areas.However, she said that the referendum result had also galvanised a reverse response in some schools, with those language teachers reporting an increased sense of need for their subject after the 2016 Brexit vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2288f424011b7a59631d96b740bf9fb117426ae1/428_1129_4326_2596/master/4326.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d855517b5f21ea103a50b36eefe703c1","title":"joy and despair in alaska adam weymouth on his 2000 mile odyssey","story":"Weymouth spent months paddling through the wilderness in a canoe, tracking the mighty king salmon. What he found was an ecosystem – and a culture – under threatThe sun is shining on the rear deck of Adam Weymouth’s barge, and the hawthorn along the banks of the river Lea is bright with new growth. But despite the natural beauty all around him in this pocket of London, he’s finding it hard to believe we can avert climate catastrophe: “It’s just really hard to give a fuck.”“Living where we do, even with the best will in the world and being as informed as you could be, nature is incredibly abstract,” Weymouth says. “When the shit hits the fan, we’re going to turn up the air conditioning. The bread might get a bit more expensive, but we’ll be all right for quite a while.”This disconnect between our comfortable urban existence and the havoc it is wreaking on the environment propelled Weymouth into the far north of the Americas to paddle 2,000 miles through the wilderness by canoe on the trail of the salmon who swim through his lyrical debut book, Kings of the Yukon.“The Arctic is heating twice as fast as other places on the planet, and those changes are much more obvious,” he says. “You’ll meet a lot of people in Alaska who question why climate change is happening, but you won’t meet anyone who believes the climate is not changing, because it’s very manifest.” Alaska is also home to the most productive oilfield in America, Weymouth says, with few alternative sources of income: “It’s a very stark way of looking at what feels much more obscured in London.”Every spring the king salmon – the biggest of the five species of Pacific salmon – swim up the Yukon to spawn in the waters of their birth. But a deadly mixture of ocean warming, early melts and commercial fishing has sent numbers crashing. Weymouth set out from the furthest end of their journey, Canada’s McNeil Lake, heading down towards the sea and the approaching salmon over tumbling rapids and winding flats, past spruce forests and grizzly bears. On the way he met First Nations elders who are wrestling with decisions about how many of the threatened fish they should catch, settlers from Maryland who are rebuilding after catastrophic floods and biologists struggling to understand the king salmon’s precipitous decline.The global shifts driving all these changes are all too familiar for Weymouth. Born in Salisbury in 1984, he spent most of his 20s as an environmental activist, working with groups like Plane Stupid. In 2009, a plan to shut down the coal-fired power station at Ratcliffe-on-Soar saw him arrested alongside 113 others. His conviction for conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass was quashed two years later, after it emerged the prosecution had failed to disclose evidence from the undercover policeman Mark Kennedy, but he was already beginning to move away from direct action.“It felt like really important work,” Weymouth says, “but it was only nourishing one part of what I wanted to be doing. The writing and the thinking and the other parts of why I’d become interested in human ecology and the environment were falling by the wayside.” Not only did campaigning take up a huge amount of his time and energy, it was emotionally draining. “There’s a real exhausting cynicism about the world and its future that people almost get high on. It’s like a relationship that’s turned toxic – it’s hard to see any joy in it any more.”A narrowboat in London was a halfway house from which Weymouth could launch into freelance journalism, a route which saw him travel to Alaska in 2013, looking for stories about natural resources. He wound up reporting on the trial of 23 Yu’pik fishermen who had defied a ban on catching king salmon. As the salmon population crashed and restrictions were extended to cover the whole of the Yukon for the first time, Weymouth hatched a plan to travel the length of the river by canoe, charting how the changes in the environment are affecting the fish and the people who depend on them.This slow journey, always coming from the nearest town upriver and heading to the next downstream, gave Weymouth a way of making connections with the people he met along the way, and helped break down barriers to communication.“There isn’t a fantastic relationship between white people and indigenous people in the north of Canada and Alaska,” he says, “for very good reasons. Generally, the white people turning up are teachers or cops or some sort of government official, and generally with some sort of authority they’re quite keen on using.”As he paddled down towards the sea, Weymouth discovered the fate of the king salmon in Alaska is “very much in the balance”.The situation for the salmon may be critical, Weymouth says, but alongside the modern loss of biological ersity is also an extinction of culture that has received much less attention. “Why should people not be part of that ecosystem, why is the culture not part of what we’re trying to value and keep?” A lot of British nature writing seems “deliberately apolitical”, he says. “If people are brought in at all, it might be 18th-century poets who might have written about the landscape, rather than the people who were cleared off it or the people trying to make a living on it now.”“Finding a balance between the joy and that despair is very important,” he says. He lifts his gaze to the sunshine rippling across the glinting surface of the canal. “It’s a very easy way to burn yourself out, just thinking that everything is fucked.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4c1550e661e1bed79c962e14741430336debad/418_0_4513_2708/master/4513.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99caa57e4b71c9cab2ed5c1460b8812e","title":"bbc radio 1 biggest weekend review taylor swift liam payne years and years","story":"Swift was imperious and Liam Payne icky, while Years \u0026amp Years and Christine and the Queens were truly transportingTo the right of the main stage at BBC Radio 1’s Biggest Weekend is a hillside lined with terraced houses. It’s strangely moving to see the globe’s biggest pop stars juxtaposed against the Swansea suburbs, a surreal manifestation of how radio brings bring different worlds into remote enclaves – by turns thrillingly transgressive and profoundly humdrum.Nobody embodies the latter more than Liam Payne, who has the harried stage patter of a comic losing steam. “What are we up to next – oh yeah, I like this one,” the ex-One Direction member says to introduce a cover of Charlie Puth’s Attention, a song that affirms his set’s main theme, namely how shallow girls are for succumbing to his irresistibility. His own lyrics about sex are oddly biological. “Let me be the one to fill it up,” he sings on Familiar, a lyric to cross one’s legs to. It continues: “You’re shaped like a model or some kind of bottle.” Newcastle Brown Ale? Cycling flask?Payne is as charmless as George Ezra is endearing. Ezra might be a cleaned-up Paolo Nutini with an affected baritone, but his jaunty barbecue anthems have the power to part clouds. Plus, he seems thrilled to be here, which is more than you can say for some. Demi Lovato disappears for a whole song, ceding the floor to Luis Fonsi. Whether singing or talking, she shouts incessantly, and with her hi-vis jacket, wouldn’t seem misplaced directing traffic in the car park. Equally vapid but disturbingly compelling are 30 Seconds to Mars. Jared Leto resembles Charles Manson in athleisure and basks like a pig in muck as the crowd roar his words back at him, as if he had written God Only Knows instead of a series of longueurs anchored by deathless calls of “whoa-oh-oh”.More innovative are J Hus and Camila Cabello, the former upgrading his much-mimicked Afrobeats for a staunch seven-piece group. And Cabello makes time stop in her excellent, unhurried set. Unlike Lovato’s gale-force belting, she wields her powerful voice as a vaporous falsetto on Never Be the Same and a sultry wink on Havana, and savours a rendition of Can’t Help Falling in Love at the piano. She seems properly in tune with her material, an oddly rare sensation this weekend.Without question the most transporting moments come from from Years \u0026amp Years and Christine and the Queens. Their sets foreground queerness with muscular, erotic dancing – the former’s finds frontman Olly Alexander writhing against figures dressed as gimps and cyberpunks in a way that suggests he’s been studying Perfume Genius. During Desire’s liberationist dance-pop, the dancers peel away his jumpsuit and attach a silver cape to his front. A riser then propels him – and this vast cape that makes Meghan Markle’s train look like a napkin – 10 metres into the air while he sings Palo Santo. The fabric falls away to reveal a green, navel-skimming jumpsuit: Peter Pan crossed with Bowie. Payne’s warmed-over tropical house is a distant memory.If Alexander’s weapon is glitter, Héloïse Letissier’s is sweat. Her armpits are soaked, the knees of her pink trousers lagged in dirt her agile neck movements reveal a love bite. While fashion prizes matte surfaces and suppressed effort, Letissier’s insistence on the consequences of physical contact is revelatory. Her new album is “about leaving your teenage room to go out into the world”: a song like Saint Claude was about “trying to fit in”, and features delicate dancing focused around her hands. In contrast, the choreography behind new single Girlfriend is macho, muscular and aggressive.If only more people could see it – Letissier suffers from being scheduled opposite Taylor Swift. The latter half of Swift’s set is ironclad, though there’s a dissonance between her acidic new aesthetic and the sincere interactions with her fans that she still clearly enjoys. As they do her: as isive as Swift may be, there is no moment all weekend as unifying as Shake It Off.• This review was amended on 28 May to correct the titles of two songs played by Camila Cabello."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733cea149f8b9016a6615858a8757b8fa6e50838/0_0_6200_3721/master/6200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d545afc0c2a2cb7830de9d772321fcb","title":"revealed developers cashing in privatisation uk student housing","story":"More than 20,000 UK students are paying for rooms owned by companies based offshoreTens of thousands of undergraduates are paying for accommodation at universities where developers are cashing in on the privatisation of student housing using offshore companies, a  investigation has found.More than 20,000 students are paying for rooms owned by companies based in places such as Jersey, Guernsey, the British Virgin Islands and Luxembourg but that figure is likely to be an underestimate given the surge in building in university towns in recent years.The holding structure means that overseas investors are able to sell on the rooms without paying tax on their gains and it allows buildings to change hands without any stamp duty bill. Complex company arrangements also give companies the opportunity to minimise the tax they pay while charging students up to £14,000 a year in fees for high-end housing.One company collected £2.2m in rental income in 2016 but contributed just £10,000 in income tax after it paid £2.1m in charges, mostly to a Luxembourg based holding company.For residential property the only real advantage is anonymity - rules introduced in recent years mean that you will pay more tax to put a home into an offshore company, and face an annual fee to if the property is worth more than £500,000. But for commercial properties there are still benefits - overseas investors can sell properties held in offshore companies without triggering a UK capital gains tax (CGT) bill. And purpose-built student accommodation qualifies as commercial property.Buying a building directly will trigger a stamp duty land tax bill, but if you buy the shares in a company that owns a commercial property, you will escape the tax. If the company is in a country with no tax on share purchases, even better. On a building costing £25m the potential saving is £1m.They are. The 2017 budget included a consultation on bringing offshore companies into CGT, and the plan is to do that in April 2019. The consultation issued in November suggested that gains made prior to that date will not count - calculations will be based on the value of properties on 1 April 2019 and it will only be future gains that are taxed.Possibly not - the main advantages will have disappeared, and owning property via a UK company is pretty straightforward. However, if they are holding properties in a number of different countries they may still see a practical value to not using a UK company.The structures are perfectly legal, but MPs and students criticised their use.John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, said: “Students are squeezed enough without paying high rents to offshore companies. It is a disgrace that offshore companies are maximising their gain from UK students whilst minimising their tax liability here.“That this is perfectly legal demonstrates exactly why parliament needs to thoroughly examine issues of tax avoidance, evasion and offshoring.”The student accommodation industry has been transformed in recent years as universities have turned to private developers to provide accommodation.One study estimated the market to be worth £45bn and billions of pounds worth of deals were done in 2017 alone. Investors from all over the world have snapped up student properties in England and Wales including big pension funds, foreign states and wealthy iniduals.Those that bought companies holding buildings, rather than buying properties directly, will not have had to pay any stamp duty land tax.Analysis of Land Registry data and company accounts show many developments are owned by investors through companies or funds set up abroad. found developments all over England and Wales – including London, Exeter, Newcastle, Chester and Bristol.Holding a property offshore currently allows overseas investors to sell on properties without a UK tax bill on their profits. This is due to change in April 2019, although any gains made before then are expected to be ignored and not subject to tax.Complex structures involving large loans and charges also allow investors to minimise the profits they pay tax on and make gains on sales without facing any bill from HMRC.Investors may own whole blocks or, in some cases, snap up inidual rooms with the promise of high returns. For instance, among the owners of one student block in Newcastle are companies based in jurisdictions including United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.Investors paid about £100,000 for each room, with students charged upwards of £135 a week to live there.Accounts for the UK manager of the Courtrooms, a Student Housing Company block in Bristol where students pay £161 a week for an en-suite single room, show that in 2016 it collected a rental income of £2.2m and paid £10,000 in income tax. The bill was reduced by charges of almost £2.1m, the bulk of which were payments to Unicity XV Bristol Sarl, a Luxembourg company registered as the owner of the property.A spokesperson said: “We are a responsible business whose revenue and operations are taken into account when calculating profits on which we pay tax.”Analysis by the  found more than 100 student apartment blocks around England and Wales owned by different offshore companies, with the actual number likely to be higher as there is no clear way to identify student properties in the records.Land Registry listings cover only England and Wales, and some blocks are described as “land”, or another type of building, because that is what the developer purchased before converting into student rooms.Owners are liable for UK tax on the rents they collect from students, but can receive the money before tax and reduce the amount they have to pay by offsetting expenses and debt repayments.One big investor is GSA, which in partnership with Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund owns 13 buildings around the country managed by the Student Housing Company. The buildings are owned by separate Luxembourg companies.Millions of pounds in rent is collected by UK companies that then pass on payments to Luxembourg. The Luxembourg companies charge high costs for managing the buildings, allowing the firm to reduce the tax it pays.The National Union of Students vice-president for welfare, Izzy Lenga, said UK students were seen as a cash cow by overseas investors, and often had no choice but to take rooms in “overpriced glass towers”.Lenga said: “Overseas investors make billions of pounds building luxury apartments and charging sky-high rents for students. There is a cost of living crisis and finding good-quality affordable accommodation is a huge barrier for low- and middle-income students attending our world-leading institutions.”Additional reporting by Sunniva Kolostyak"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d363e5c66c4a1b8ebb06ddef607b4fa187a23f39/0_155_4670_2802/master/4670.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fee19ba16f68df63a19d4042d56a8203","title":"pregnant breastfeeding models key bumper sales","story":"From Chanel to Victoria’s Secret, visible bumps and breastfeeding are increasingly being used to sell clothes. It says a lot about fashion’s changing relationship with womenFashion loves to break its own rules, then unbreak them, then pretend the rules didn’t exist, then act as though everyone knew the rules all along, and since from the outside there is only one rule – be thin – this leads to some quite complex conversations. One year, you will find a plus-size model on every catwalk, and the next year they will have vanished.But the final frontier is the pregnant woman, or – pretty much interchangeably, because you always look pregnant for ages after you are, unless you’re Madonna – the breastfeeding woman. There was that brief moment in 1991, when Annie Leibovitz put a gravid Demi Moore on the cover of Vanity Fair wearing nothing at all (commentators describe her pose as the “hand-bra”). Nothing came after. The pregnant woman remained culturally invisible, which really is a curious sensation when you’re in it, given how ginormous you are.New York fashion week broke that article of faith last year, when the Eckhaus Latta show featured Maia Ruth Lee, who was eight months pregnant at the time, wearing a cardigan dress with a perfectly domed opening for her mighty tum, like something a midwife might design if he or she were in such a rush they wanted to measure everyone’s fundus by eye. But that reminded everyone: there actually had been some pregnant catwalk models, this decade. You could fit them all into two taxis, like the Lib Dems, but nine is more than none.There was Jourdan Dunn for Jean Paul Gaultier’s springsummer 2010 show and Italian model Bianca Balti for Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana’s autumnwinter 2015 collection.New Zealand model Ashleigh Good was the final showstopper in the Chanel show for autumnwinter 1415, looking so pure and punk, so breathtakingly wonderful, that close observers may have felt that chill of the truly unattainable standards of fashion: to meet its trend criteria, you might have to get pregnant.Victoria’s Secret has been at the vanguard, accounting for three of those nine. But its catwalk always has an uncomfortable relationship with the fashion mainstream, being too raunchy and saucy and seeming to miss the point (it’s art, not clothes-porn), but every now and then sailing past the point to make a new and possibly better one.Jenni Kayne, an LA brand you might put into the category athleisure, saw sales triple after an image of TyLynn Nguyen breastfeeding\u0026nbspwent up on billboards in New York this month, defying marketing truisms (who last bought something\u0026nbspthey saw on a billboard? Nancy Reagan?) but also deeper assumptions about where our ego sits in relation to images of female beauty. If we were simply spectators to the more urgent male gaze, a breastfeeding woman would be like a regular woman, only not as good. But if we’re projecting ourselves, our hopes and memories, on to the image, then\u0026nbspit makes perfect sense for this to spike sales, since breastfeeding is a much more profound romantic experience than, say, having a shower.It would be fanciful to claim that pregnant models do much to spread the idea that pregnancy is, in itself, beautiful. But I still find the development quite heartening, for putting the female audience at the centre of an art form. For a bloody change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9755c69dba3d86c74e41e37003d990f501816c8/0_123_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a06bd2930b6ccf457a133fd856e39027","title":"eni aluko chelsea abroad world cup pundit interview","story":"Forward reflects on a ‘stressful, negative period’ as she gets set to play abroad after leaving Chelsea while looking forward to some World Cup punditryEni Aluko is wearing a lime-green Hawaiian print shirt and is surprisingly sprightly after a week of celebrations to mark the end of her time as a Chelsea player. There was a champagne party bus home from the game in Bristol where the club won the title unbeaten, plus festivities that followed her scoring in her final match at Liverpool. Back in London, Aluko cooked paella for 20 friends at her home and David Luiz invited the squad to dine at his new Italian restaurant.“It had been an amazing week with women who have become good friends,” Aluko says. “Finishing this season in such a positive way wrapped up what started so negatively for me personally.”Between the revelry, there were plenty of tears as the 31-year-old considered reversing her decision. Aluko had grown frustrated at her bit-part role, concluding after five and a half years with Chelsea she would be more fulfilled elsewhere. She has signed with a club in Europe but won’t reveal where.“I’ve achieved pretty much everything I wanted to with Chelsea except maybe the Champions League, which I could still do somewhere else. I love to travel and sample new cultures the opportunity to play in Europe and learn a language is a big one. But there have been a lot of tears. I was crying on the pitch in Bristol. I have such a strong bond with the people I work with and questioned whether I’m ever going to experience that again with a new team, whether I’ll be that happy – the doubts start creeping in.”A forward with electrifying pace, Aluko has been one of the outstanding players in Britain for more than 15 years, since joining Birmingham City Ladies aged 15. Marcus Bignot, her coach at the time, called her the “Wayne Rooney of women’s football”.Her mum, Sileola, and dad, Daniel, a former MP in Nigeria, moved the family from Lagos to Birmingham when Aluko was six months old. She excelled at school and her parents encouraged her to continue her education even as it became apparent a top-flight football career was a possibility for her and her younger brother, Sone.Alongside playing she graduated with a first-class honours degree from Brunel University and worked as a lawyer. Aluko is adamant girls should not be forced to choose between a football career and academic studies, calling for clubs to offer the same opportunities as they do to their male counterparts.“My issue is young, talented players not having to compromise their education. If you look at the men’s academy setups, they have partnerships with colleges or universities, whereas we don’t really have that with women’s football. You don’t want an 18-year-old girl who’s very talented thinking: ‘I want to play for the first team but I’ve got to give up my education to do so.’ That has happened a lot in the past.“Some of big men’s clubs like Man City, Chelsea and Arsenal have raised the bar in terms of salaries and professionalism of the women’s game. I think there needs to be continued increase in salaries to reflect the attention on the game and its commercial viability. The argument before was that nobody was watching but that’s not true nowadays.”The idea that 45,000 fans would attend a women’s FA Cup final, as they did this month at Wembley, was scarcely believable when Aluko was cutting her teeth in the Midlands. She has noticed more girls coming up to her in the street or at games but what she finds most heartening is the sight of more young boys at Women’s Super League matches.“That’s the biggest change: young boys watching like they’re watching a men’s game, coming up and asking for my boots just as they would with Eden Hazard. That’s not only going to affect their perception of football it’s going to affect their perception of women, so when they grow up to have relationships they’re more likely to respect women as equals. They are seeing women in a very positive light and in a strong, competitive environment. Women’s sport has become normalised.”Aluko did not set out to become a champion of equality or a spokesperson on problems around discrimination. But she found herself on the front page and in parliament after accusing the former England women’s coach Mark Sampson of making racial comments to her and another player. She also alleged the Football Association had failed to investigate properly, as revealed by the\u0026nbsp.Privately Aluko was shunned by some of her former team-mates and was publicly accused of being a liar. An investigation by the barrister Katharine Newton ruled she had told the truth. Sampson later lost his job for an unrelated matter. But after a distinguished 11-year international career during which she won 102 caps, Aluko has been on the England sidelines for two years. Phil Neville has left the door open but she does not know if she will go back.“I spoke to him at a Chelsea game this season and it was a nice conversation. I congratulated him on his appointment and we talked about him moving back from Spain and I’m sure he’s seen a few games where I’ve played this season.“But I’ve moved on from what was a very stressful, negative period in my life. I’ve dealt with it in the best way I could. Standing up for what you believe in and being honest, telling the truth are all very liberating things. Since that time I’ve felt very empowered by other people seeing you can stand for what you believe, even in adversity. Success is always the best answer to critics. When you look at some of the greatest people and players in the world they all stand for something outside their working lives.”Aluko will be in Russia working as a pundit on ITV’s World Cup coverage. In 2014 she made history as the first female pundit on Match of the Day and believes she has opened the door for other women players to make a move into broadcasting, although she concedes there is still a way to travel for equality.“I think it gets massively forgotten with women commentators and pundits that we grew up watching men’s football. I remember the FA Cup final – Man United v Everton – in 1995 and we lost 1-0 and me and my brother were all dressed in the full kit and we were crying our eyes out. My mum came in the room and was like: ‘What is wrong with my children, why are they so devastated about a football match?’ That was my upbringing.“To be going to Russia to work on a men’s World Cup is incredible. I never thought that would happen and it shows a shift in broadcasting where women are becoming accepted just as part of the team. I think the difference is that if women fail, the consequences are greater.“There’s a tendency for some male pundits who have done it for years to rock up and take it for granted. I can’t afford to do that so that’s why I have to geek out on all the stats and facts and make sure I am not seen as a token woman but that I’m adding to the conversation.”As with all areas of her life and playing career, Aluko will ensure she is well prepared for any eventuality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb191bd46d1a59def10373249d499cbf5f8df8e8/100_0_3387_2032/master/3387.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a67ffe083482e42907f3dc1890ac1e83","title":"coventry city v exeter city league two play off final live","story":"Coventry roar to promotion from the fourth tier with fine second-half goals from Jordan Willis, Jordan Shipley and Jack Grimmer defeating a flat ExeterA heartwarming way to finish. You have to feel for Exeter, a great club that have done wonders, but it’s a very good news story for Coventry – they deserved it with a fine second-half performance on the day, and their long-suffering fans have more than earned a moment like this. The celebrations will go on a long time.Here’s our match report, courtesy of Ben Fisher. Enjoy, and go and rest yourselves for a few days before the World Cup buildup begins in earnest!McNulty, the correctly-appointed man of the match, has a word: “You go through a lot more bad days than good days and it’s worth it, these days are worth all the bad days. We’ve been up and down all season and it’s been frustrating but days like today ... I took quite a lot of stick at the start of the season but it’s part and parcel of football and I know it would turn at some point. Today was special.“There’ve been a lot of problems with the owners and fans staying way for whatever reason, but now we’re back in League One it’d be great for them to come back and support the boys.”What now for Exeter after two Wembley defeats in successive years? Surely Tisdale will leave Steve Perryman, their director of football, will too. It will have to be a new era for them and they’ll need to manage it well – without sounding patronising, a club of that size needs exceptional people.A fine list. I’ll have to get back to you on 2018’s redeeming factors.Now Coventry lift the trophy! Golden glitter showers them. Half of Wembley is empty now, the other half is jubilant. They’ve needed a day like this.“I have no affiliation to Coventry, but their 1987 FA Cup victory is the first game I can remember watching on the TV,” hearkens Shaun Wilkinson. “Their slide has been very sad, and seeing this today has cheered me right up. Congrats Coventry! Now they need to strengthen their squad. Is Micky Gynn still playing?”Robins speaks, briefly: “We need backing again now, let’s not rest on our laurels. It’s amazing, I can’t give enough credit to everybody.”Stockley laces one a whisker wide for Exeter and then ... that’s it! Coventry done it with a 3-1 win and it’s richly deserved on the day – after some dark, dark years, a huge ray of light!90+3 min: No, I don’t think so. Burge claims a ball forwards and Coventry are going to be more than OK here.90+1 min: Five minutes of added time. They couldn’t ... could they?It won’t count for much but it’s another superb strike for our afternoon and it comes from the substitute winger Edwards – whose introduction I missed, sorry – who dances inside from the left and fairly lashes one into the far corner. Lovely stuff from him but if only Exeter had shown something remotely like that earlier.88 min: And if you wonder why the Coventry fans are so full of song, here’s why: it’s their first promotion since 1967! They’ve had this saved up!87 min: It was Grimmer, of course, who scored a fantastic winner against Stoke in the FA Cup. Coventry played some fine stuff in that run and have done so again today. If – and it’s a massive “if” – they can keep this side together, who could rule out a tilt at another promotion?84 min: Storey loops a header well wide. This game, in particular, has gone.82 min: Off the post from Jay! That’s Exeter’s best moment as the substitute sets his sights just outside the area, lets fly and clips the outside of the frame. That might have made it interesting. Instead, Coventry are emboldened to bring off the game’s best player, Marvellous Marc McNulty, and bring on Ponticelli.79 min: Bayliss weaves into the area, hoping to join the list of great goals, but Pym reacts very well to keep his deflected effort out. Exeter survive the corner. If anyone’s going to score the next goal I don’t think it’ll be Exeter.78 min: Exeter are pushing, but don’t really seem to have any belief and Coventry are happy to commit men forward on the counter. It’s been a blistering second half from the Sky Blues, it really has.75 min: Harley has what is Exeter’s best effort by miles, swirling in a right-footer from 25 yards that Burge has to fingertip round the post.74 min: “Torn on this one,” writes Kevin Wilson. As nice as it is to see Coventry make their way back, I’m still unhappy with the part they played in Barnet’s relegation!”Yes, if they’d played this well against Morecambe on the final day ...73 min: Another word for McNulty, who has been so much more than an out-and-out striker today constantly running the channels, playing with his head up and bucketloads of intelligence. His two assists reflect that. Exeter threaten with a far-post header that goes across goal, about as close as anything they’ve produced. Then Coventry replace Shipley with Kyel Reid.72 min: Coventry’s owner, Joy Seppala, smiles from her place in the stands. I’m not sure the fans’ delight will necessarily include her but let’s hope this is the start of better days for them.Oh, that is a lovely goal! They’ve scored some belters here! Coventry are heading to League One and this came after a ball from Bayliss into McNulty, who then lays the ball back to the right-back Grimmer, who curls an absolutely picture-perfect shot up and over Pym. That was a beautiful move from Coventry, all slick passing and movement to create space for each other, and an absolutely top-class finish.68 min: That’s a bit better, a sweeping move giving Sweeney a chance to cross, but nobody attacks it and Burge leaps to catch.66 min: Coventry can sit off a little now, knowing they have legs on the counter and that Exeter seem capable of offering next to nothing.Not bad! He’s been very good today.63 min: Now it does go out and off goes Woodman, replaced by James. We also see Jay replace Moxey. All change on the left side, basically.62 min: Exeter have wanted to make a double sub for a long time now but the ball won’t go out. They need to shake things up badly, there is no pace or spark out there.60 min: ... which is also defended well, so well that Coventry can break in numbers and Shipley, with men over, drills one from 30 yards that Pym has to fingertip wide!59 min: Exeter earn a right-sided corner. It’s handy from Boateng, aimed dangerously towards the back stick, and defended well for another ...56 min: As things stand you’d think Exeter are going to kick themselves for, to all intents and purposes, not turning up here. Coventry came out blazing for the second half and it’s probably won them the game!They don’t have as much as Coventry! Now Exeter have a mountain to climb as McNulty, holding off a defender, surges into open space and plays a perfectly-weighted ball left to Shipley, whose left-footed shot deflects cruelly off a defender and loops agonisingly over a despairing Pym. Most of Wembley goes berserk! They have one and a half feet in League One.53 min: The game needed that goal, and will surely open right up now. What have Exeter got?52 min: It was Doyle’s pass to Willis, and the finish was just everything you’d dream of at Wembley. It should soften some of the disappointment for Biamou, who has injured something and has to go off now, replaced by Clarke-Harris.And that is *much* more like it! It comes from the centre-half Willis, and what a strike! He stays upfield as Coventry try and get things going again following that cleared corner, takes a sharp pass to feet 22 yards out, spins and whips a wonderful shot up and around Pym into the far corner. A goal from absolutely nothing, and from the least likely of players. Game on!48 min: It’s Coventry who start the sharper, Bayliss and McNulty just waiting to link up the first time and then, on the second occasion, Bayliss cutting back for McNulty to see a drive batted round the post by Pym. The corner comes to nought. More like it though!Right then ...Back underway shortly. I think somebody will cut loose and win this in normal time. Can’t look too far beyond Coventry, for who McNulty is a real livewire, if they up the pace. But if Exeter can play a bit more effectively off Stockley they’ll threaten too.Both sides had spells on top, and Coventry have certainly looked the more threatening when they get it together, but that was a forgettable half on a humid Wembley afternoon. I’m fairly sure it’ll get better. I am!45+2 min: Shipley now plays a nice give-and-go with McNulty but can’t quite work the angle and his shot is blocked by Moore-Taylor. As the half comes to a close Coventry have found something close to their earlier rhythm.45 min: And as we hit 45 minutes a first real combination from the Coventry strike pair, Biamou heading down astutely for McNulty to slice over with a defender in close attendance.44 min: Now it’s Storey with his second last-ditch challenge of the game, making a vital interception to stop a Doyle ball through to McNulty from reaching its man. Exeter wanted an offside but McNulty’s movement really is very clever at times.43 min: Hyam, the Coventry defender, stretches to boot a right-wing cross away. Boateng has grown in stature for Exeter during the half and is quite dominant in midfield at the moment.41 min: Can’t really mess around with this: nothing very interesting is happening in this game at all. It’s safe to say both sides are pacing themselves in the heat, and I’m pretty sure we will see a much livelier second half. Woodman’s cross bounces away from Stockley as Exeter try and make me look even sillier than usual.38 min: Biamou, McNulty’s strike partner, is down – collapsing very softly indeed after running up against .... I think ... Storey. He gets up, and now seems OK.36 min: It’s definitely fair to say Coventry’s head of steam has spluttered out, and we can easily trace that back to Stokes’s brief absence.35 min: Replays suggest Coventry’s Michael Doyle elbowed Jake Taylor during an Exeter attack a few minutes ago. Nada from the officials. Was Doyle lucky not to be shown a card of some colour?33 min: Stockley is now causing a few problems and another flick-on allows a cross to come in from wide, although again it’s not particularly threatening. At the other end Shipley warms Pym’s palms with a strike from the edge of the area.31 min: Exeter definitely seem to have pushed up a yard or two since that little injury break. A long daisycutter from ... I admit I didn’t see who ... is gathered by Burge and now the game has a touch more snap about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97e7e2247537f10b6a68b9f3befa9c949863b527/2_0_848_509/master/848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=586cc2d23c2acfc0afc6324d1ab8942f","title":"germanys all time world cup xi create your own","story":"Kicking off our new series involving 12 national teams, we challenge you to pick your best Germany XI of all time  Choose your formation and then use the See below how the  readers\u0027 all-time Germany XI ended up looking.Look below to see how your team selection has affected the live voting.Voting is now closed, but you can still choose your all-time XI below."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd6a3d9a3ad23b78c34b6499980233b1117c0634/0_1539_2667_1600/master/2667.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=202de95630b15a06a422353aa26bd17c","title":"anna jones vegetable tart recipes","story":"For a simple way to elevate seasonal veg, put them in a wholemeal tart or a herby filo oneNothing tempts like a tart. The buttery crumb of the pastry that gives way under your fork, the soft quiver of the filling within, the crumbs you can dab into your mouth with a finger. I make tarts far less than I should considering how much I like them.These two may not be quick, but they are relatively easy: one uses buff leaves of shop-bought filo the other an easy olive-oil pastry that doesn’t need to rest. Both are filled with the spoils of spring. Tempted?A perfect tart to weave together the days of spring and summer. Spears of asparagus, buttery leeks, dijon and an unexpected hit of rosemary. This quick olive-oil pastry is easy enough for a weeknight. I use cherry tomatoes until the season is in full swing. You’ll need a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin.For the pastry200g wholemeal or light spelt flour1 sprig rosemary, leaves picked and finely choppedZest of 1 unwaxed lemon, finely grated 1 pinch salt50ml olive oilCold waterFor the filling400g cherry tomatoes, halvedSalt and black pepperExtra-virgin olive oil1 leek, finely sliced2 sprigs rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped450g asparagus3 eggs3 tbsp creme fraicheZest of 1 unwaxed lemon, finely grated1 tsp dijon mustardHeat the oven to 120C250Fgas ¼. Lay the tomatoes cut side up on a baking tray, season, drizzle with olive oil, then slowly roast for about an hour, until soft, sweet and gummy. Take a handful out for the dressing, and set aside. Once the tomatoes are roasted, take them out of the oven and turn the heat up temperature to 180C350Fgas 4.Next make the pastry. Put the flour, rosemary, lemon zest and salt into a food processor. Pulse a few times, then add the olive oil and pulse again until you have crumbs. Add about 75ml of cold water until it comes together in a ball. (If you don’t have a food processor you can do this just as easily by hand.)On a floured work surface, roll it out to just bigger than the tart tin, then carefully wrap it around your rolling pin and lower it into the tin. Gently press it in, so the pastry takes the shape of the tin. Prick with a fork and blind bake for 12 minutes (no need to use baking beans for with this pastry).Saute the leek in a little oil for 20 minutes until soft and sweet, add the rosemary and cook for a minute. Put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Snap the asparagus spears spears near the base – they will naturally break off where the fibrous part ends. Boil the asparagus for two to three minutes, until the spears are still firm but not crunchy. Drain, season at once and drizzle with oil.Mix the eggs with the creme fraiche, sauteed leeks, zest and dijon, then season. Once the pastry is ready, scatter with the asparagus, then pour over the creme fraiche mixture and scatter with the tomatoes.Bake the tart on the bottom of the oven at 200C390Fgas 6 for 15-20 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and the eggs just set. Serve with a sharply dressed green salad.This tart is incidentally vegan, provided you use vegan filo, which happens to be the most common.500g fresh or frozen peasOlive oil1 bunch spring onions, slicedSalt and black pepper1 x 400g tin white beans, drained1 preserved lemon, flesh removed, rind finely chopped1 handful green olives, stoned and roughly chopped1 good pinch chilli flakes1 small bunch mint, picked and roughly chopped1 small bunch parsley, picked and roughly chopped1 × 200g pack filo pastryHeat the oven to 220C425Fgas 7.

Tip into a bowl and add the rest of the peas, the preserved lemon, olives, chilli, mint and parsley, then season well and mix.Unwrap the sheets of filo and lay them over your frying pan, leaving a little overlap round the edges (you’ll fold this in later). Drizzle with oil, then keep layering the filo and drizzling with oil until you have a good, sturdy, three- to four-sheet layer all over – you may need to patch it together bit by bit if you have small sheets.Drizzle the whole lot with a bit more olive oil, then use a pastry brush to persuade the oil all over the pastry. Spoon the filling into the middle, spread it evenly across the base, put the pan over a medium heat and cook for three to four minutes to crisp up the pastry from the bottom.Fold the excess filo back over the filling to form a wavy edge.

At least, this is the lie I tell myself, how I am able to face my reflection in the mirror every day without collapsing into a puddle of regret.After spending a year at a dance conservatory in London, I quit. A year later, I tried again at a university in my home state of Virginia. But two years in, I broke my foot and decided to switch to a major that was less tied to my physical integrity: journalism. Soon, I became the arts editor of the school paper. Now, 10 years after graduating from college, I have three beautiful sons and a successful freelance writing career. But the fact that I quit before I had the chance to see if I could truly succeed haunts me to this day.I struggle to articulate this level of experience when explaining my background to people. I “trained to be a professional dancer” I was a “semi-professional dancer” I “studied dance in college and used to teach ballet classes”. When you bring up past dance experience, most people assume it was merely a little girl’s daydream, but for me, it was so much more. What do you call it when you dedicate all of your time and energy to preparing for something but don’t ever become that something? What’s the name for not being strong enough to risk failure so you quit while you’re ahead and live the rest of your life comforting yourself with the notion that you might have “made it” if only you’d really tried? Isn’t that it’s own special, uniquely devastating form of failure?Our culture fetishizes determination, grit, success. We are told again and again that hard work will eventually pay off, that quitting is practically unforgivable. What we don’t hear is that success isn’t necessarily synonymous with happiness and that giving up can be an act of self-preservation.It is spring in New York City and I am 16. My dance teacher has driven me and one other student up so we could take a few master classes at various schools and studios around town and so that I could audition for a place at the Joffrey Ballet School. It is my first visit to New York and I am immediately intoxicated by the dangerous combination of the city’s energy and a newfound sense of freedom. I taste my first Indian food, buy chunky pleather platform loafers, do ballet poses for photos next to the rocks in Central Park.This Joffrey studio is much smaller and much dimmer than I imagined it’s not much more than a couple of grocery-store aisles wide. As a young dancer in a tiny college town, I had envisioned a vast, sun-filled affair, but I underestimated how strapped for space cities are. The worst part of any audition is always before it starts. That’s when you can psych yourself out. I pull at my itchy pink tights and readjust the leg holes of my black leotard. While warming up, I try to avoid my reflection in the mirror, but also keep an eye out for the coveted “skinny mirror” that each studio possesses. It helps that none of the other girls here are auditioning they are students and I am just a guest in the class.Can a thicker brush not make just as beautiful strokes?I am nervous but unintimidated. I know how to do this. I’ve got this. I’m in my element. The class goes well. Really well. I remember all of the combinations, remember to smile. I am energetic and quick on my feet. Most importantly, I can keep up with the other students. After class, I excitedly head to the changing room, surprised by how well I did and hopeful of my chances at being accepted into the school. I think about how, if admitted, I would leave home and live in a dorm at the Carmelite nuns’ convent.“She’s good, but she’s big,” I overhear the instructor say to my dance teacher as I am coming back down the hallway.I stop in my tracks, trying to process this comment without crying or letting on that I heard. But in that moment, my spirit is crushed. So many thoughts swirl through my head on the rest of our trip. I can’t believe that the wrongness of my body’s shape carries more weight than my ability to move it precisely and artfully through space. I can’t believe that a skinnier, potentially less-talented dancer would get “my” spot at the school. But most of all, I can’t believe how embarrassing and utterly humiliating it feels to be turned down not because I’m not good enough, but because I’m not skinny enough.These thoughts eventually crystallize into confusion, questions. Why had I been blessed with these talents in this body? What does it mean when your body is your art? Can a thicker brush not make just as beautiful strokes?I come late to dance. Later than most anyway. I am 11 years old when I take my first class – it’s a free class being offered on the stage of the little community theater in my small college town – but my natural aptitude quickly became apparent. As a naturally quiet, introverted person, dance is a revelation. I don’t have to speak a word to anyone. I discover a world beyond words, where movements tell stories in ways that words only ever dream of doing. It’s a world where words themselves become superfluous and seem almost perversely simplistic, and I am overjoyed to inhabit it every day.Soon, I am training for two to four hours a day. Homeschooling means I can be driven to studios an hour from my home to take classes multiple times a week with more advanced teachers. Finally, I am living with other families or my dance teacher during the week so I can train at the best school in the region. Summers are spent at ballet “intensives”, which means six weeks away from home, living in dorms, taking classes all day at the Washington Ballet and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. I am getting better and better. I revel in my ability to balance en pointe forever and turn with ease. I once did five rotations in a single pirouette turn. Five. The typical maximum for women is three. It’s a moment I will never forget.But when you hear the word “ballerina”, my body is not what your mind’s eye conjures.When puberty hits at 15, weight begins to stick to me. I begin to sport fleshy hips, meaty thighs, a blossoming bosom. I’m not fat amongst “regular” people – I wear a women’s size 8 – but I am fat for a ballerina. In this profession, rarely is anyone bigger than a size 4. Ballerinas are supposed to be beyond human: to evoke ethereal, otherworldly beings that toe the line between the sensual and the virginal. To have noticeable breasts and hips is to interrupt this fantasy with grotesque sexuality, to remind the audience that you are indeed human.After that audition, I begin to doubt my abilities, question my chances of one day becoming a professional dancer. From then on, I never see exactly what I want in the mirror. Mirrors are unavoidable for most dancers, covering the walls of nearly every studio. I spend hours in front of them every day. I like the lines I see reflected, the shapes I can contort into, how I can mimic the movements of my teachers with relative ease. What the mirror also shows me now are my birthing hips and heavy boobs, the wiggly bits of flesh hanging from my upper arms. Now when I see all my fellow dancers reflected in the mirror around me, I see not how harmonious our movements are, but how their slight frames magnify the generousness of my own.“Are you sure you’re a ballet dancer,” the orthopedic surgeon asked at a consultation for persistent pain in the joint of my right big toe. “Because you look more like a modern dancer.” I am 17 years old. And after visiting a dozen doctors in my small hometown – enduring painful cortisone shots that provided no relief – we drove two hours to see this doctor because he is the company doctor for a big regional ballet troupe. His comment leaves me embarrassed, scrambling for an answer. I’m pretty sure the doctor believes my pain is the result of the “excess” weight I am putting on my feet, but sure enough, his scans uncover a tendon fraying and rubbing in between the bones of my joint.I did try modern dance later, when I was in college. While it is a more freeing form of dance – less rigid, significantly more forgiving of differing body types – I honestly wasn’t very good at it. At school in London, I was placed in the highest level of ballet and the lowest level of modern.The summer after that crushing Joffrey audition, I am sent to stay at my grandparents’ horse farm an hour outside of New Orleans without the rest of my immediate family. It’s partly meant to be a punishment for being caught kissing a boy while just shy of the pre-appointed old-enough age of 16. But no parental punishment was worse than what I could inflict upon myself. Not for kissing boys, mind you – that was fun – but for being fat.To drown out the hum of the treadmill, I turn up the local alternative rock radio station on my cassette Walkman. The song is White Town’s I Could Never Be Your Woman. It features heavily in the rotation this summer. I haven’t lived enough to appreciate what the lyrics are implying, but the song’s eerie, repeated refrain haunts me. I keep running. The air conditioning struggles to counteract the stifling humidity. Some people say the air is “close” but it feels more like nature is trying to slowly suffocate you by gradually replacing the air with water. Best grow gills or flounder and die. I run for an hour every day, pushing the incline button higher and higher, pushing the speed button again and again. Through the sweat and the muscle aches. I stop only when I get so dizzy I worry I might pass out and fall. I run away from my fat, away from the possibility of failure. I run and I run but I never get where I want to go. I quickly discover that trying to induce my own vomiting is much too traumatic and difficult. My grandmother presents lovingly prepared, home-cooked southern food – fried eggs and meat-and-potato hash, beautiful pies – but I eat only one meal a day and refuse the rest. I love hash it’s something we never eat at home. It’s a salty, fluffy, greasy southern indulgence like no other. I’ve never refused her cooking before, but if my grandmother senses something is amiss, she doesn’t mention it. Outside of my mother’s watchful eye, I try my hand at bulimia. I quickly discover that trying to induce my own vomiting is much too traumatic and difficult. So instead, I down excessive amounts of milk of magnesia laxative. Nothing I try leads to much in the way of weight loss, mostly because I am simply messing with my metabolism. When I start eating a healthy amount of food and stop abusing laxatives, I put the weight right back on.The sweetest revenge, the best way to prove all of the doubters and haters wrong, would’ve been to go on to be wildly successful. Our culture is very clear that overcoming your shortcomings to emerge victorious is the only acceptable ending to such stories. But years of hearing how incorrect my body was took its toll. It’s hard to love an art form that everyone is telling you doesn’t love you back. It becomes too difficult to reconcile your physical talent with your physical inadequacy. I’ve largely stopped bringing up my dance background to new acquaintances. Not because it’s so far in the past or even because I don’t know how to define my experience, but because I know that when I say I was a ballet dancer, I am certain that person immediately assesses my body and wonders what kind of fantasyland I once lived in. “Ballet” has become my trigger word. Talking about it releases the hounds of self-loathing and crushing regret, who nip determinedly at my ankles.I left the world of dance for the world of words because the writing world doesn’t care if I break my foot. I figured if I couldn’t dance, at least I could write about it. I reasoned that since my body isn’t central to the art of journalism, the writing world shouldn’t care if I am 150 pounds or 250 pounds. I know now that there are no industries, virtually no spaces where women’s bodies aren’t judged. Yet writing, while still a creative pursuit, does not feed my soul in the same way that dance – the world beyond words – does.I haven’t seen the inside of a dance studio in about eight years. Every day that I don’t dance, a sliver of my soul withers. My heart aches to move again, to get lost in myself, to get lost in music, in motion, in space to trace those familiar patterns and shapes that still come so easily to me as I twirl safe in my kitchen. I want so much more. I want to be in a real studio with my peers on a real stage. I want to know what it would have been like if I’d kept going, kept pushing back at the haters.I can’t help but feel jealous of the adults I see talking about taking up ballet or re-entering the studio again for the first time since they were young. I envy that pure, uncomplicated joy that dance can bring it’s something I fear I’ll never feel again. I can’t just waltz into a dance studio and take a class. If merely mentioning dance to someone spurs a rush of inadequacy and failure, who knows what actually taking a class might unearth within me. Besides, I am not like them. I am not one of those people who merely took a few ballet classes in middle school. I could have been a professional. I got too close, so it hurts too much. It’s been a long road, but my body and I have come to a detente. I’m now a happy size 12: satisfied by the knowledge that my body – whether in spite of or because of its size – has executed perfect pirouettes and birthed beautiful babies. But coming to terms with my body doesn’t mean I necessarily forgive it for betraying me that I’ll ever stop wondering whether I might have spent my life onstage had I only been a bit lighter.Olivia Campbell is a journalist and essayist specializing in medicine, mothering, arts, and history.

Growing up in Portsmouth, I felt it was the far superior seaside town. Even though it’s just an hour away on the fast train, for me, in 2003, it felt like a different world. In Portsmouth, I felt trapped. I knew lots of people and I’m from a big family, so I always felt like I was being watched: I wasn’t. I would get on the train at Fratton, she would jump on at Chichester and 60 minutes later I would be looking out on Brighton beach.Brighton was the perfect place for a little gay to have a go at being “out” for an hour or so before going back home and pretending to have a crush on Leonardo DiCaprio (when, in truth, I just wanted to kiss Kate Winslet).She was fit, cool and had a really good MP3 player. I guess it was my first flutter of feelings for someone. I don’t think we were a couple, we never had that chat, we just both knew we were a bit different from everyone else, and in Brighton that summer we felt normal. I remember seeing older girls on the seafront pretty, cool and happily queer. I would stare at them, besotted, and wonder what their lives were like, if their families knew or if they had been kicked out of home. Were they ashamed like me? They seemed happy and they were having a laugh. It gave me hope that coming out wouldn’t ruin my life. That summer, I felt alive, I felt free. We shared roll-up cigarettes and the occasional kiss under the pier, talking about who we were going to become, where we were going to live and the adventures we would share.The six-week summer break came to an end and so did our brief romance. She decided to come out when we went back to college: she was telling everyone, even her mum. I thought she had completely lost her mind (it took at least another five years to get me out of the closet). We had a huge row on Brighton pier just in front of the waltzers a few people stopped to watch, which felt both exciting and embarrassing. She called me a dyke, I called her a bitch and we barely spoke again.It wasn’t exactly the perfect ending to my summer of love. After the row, she stormed off and I jumped on my skateboard and flew down the seafront with tears in my eyes and sea salt in my hair. I felt like I was in music video, which was thrilling, until I clipped a stone, came tumbling off and ripped my favourite pair of Dickies jeans. I vowed I would never love again, in that way that only a 17-year-old can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/296ea90161e6a6e0ef2f7ab95d79da481dbe29ab/0_0_4552_3360/master/4552.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b546df47acb3ca365392d25cd95f901a 1010w","title":"kylie minogue turns 50 in pictures","story":"To most she is just ‘Kylie’, but originally she was Charlene on Neighbours before her transition to chart-topping singer.

We’re confident that none of our guys are involved in it. As far as I’m concerned our players have got nothing to worry about. I’m really confident none of our players are involved.”The allegation of English involvement comes at an already troubling time for the Test team given the disappointing nine-wicket defeat to Pakistan at Lord’s on Sunday that has seen them now go eight matches without a win.Trevor Bayliss, the England head coach, has however insisted the allegations were not responsible for their poor showing. He said: “There was no chat about it in the change-room. It would be wrong to blame that for the way we played. When we were told about it, the thought on it was that it was rubbish.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/147125d0c7ed35a03a142c5f516247a844ea76e6/0_287_4472_2684/master/4472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02aadc9d731a003423e38f06eb580622","title":"lewis hamilton suggest monaco grand prix changes","story":"Lewis Hamilton has said the Monaco Grand Prix must adapt if it is to present exciting racing. The four-times world champion finished third on Sunday behind Daniel Ricciardo’s victorious Red Bull but was one of several drivers to say it was an exceptionally dull race to partake in and to watch.Ricciardo, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel and Hamilton finished in the same positions as they had started and despite Ricciardo being down on power no one was able to pass him. Nor did his rivals feel they could even push to attempt to do so because they were managing their tyres to ensure only one pit stop in order not to lose track position.Hamilton said he had been cruising around and was intensely frustrated that with passing all but impossible he had been instructed at an early point in the race just to bring his Mercedes home. “It wasn’t really racing,” he said. “Ultimately we were turned down and just cruising around to make sure we got to the end.”McLaren’s Fernando Alonso described it as “the most boring race ever” and Hamilton argued the circuit or race format should be changed.“I spoke to Prince Albert the other day and said maybe we should make it longer,” he said. “There are more roads so maybe we can change this great track and make it even better. Or maybe the format should change.”The circuit is largely as it was when it was created by Anthony Noghès in 1929 but the sport has changed drastically since then. There is scope to alter the layout with land reclamation projects under way – one will extend the area on the outside of Portiers before the tunnel but, it is understood, will not be completed until 2025.Since the regulations of 2017 the cars are wider, which adds to the difficulty of overtaking in Monaco. This year it was a problem exacerbated by the use of the softest compound of tyres. Pirelli had been asked to provide new softer tyres to give the chance for quicker lap times. But it came at the price of drivers being unable to push as they sought to avoid having to pit twice.Hamilton suggested more stops should be mandated for the race. “You shouldn’t be able to do a one‑stop race here,” the British world champion said. “There has to be some mixed-up things. It is the greatest track.”There is also the problem of tampering with what is seen as a classic, historic grand prix. Monaco has such prestige it is the only race not to be charged a hosting fee by F1’s owners. Much as many fans and some drivers would like to see changes, there may be an inherent reluctance to do so.Hamilton’s lead in the world championship over Vettel is 14 points but, while Ferrari remain the main threat, he expects Red Bull to continue to improve.“It definitely is a three-way fight,” he said. “Sebastian and Ferrari are still the strongest, their car was quick here, it is working well through the whole season. But it is a three-way battle and Red Bull have an engine upgrade coming at some stage. They will continue to get stronger.“While the race wasn’t the most exciting, hopefully it is great for the fans to see this battle. We are doing everything we can to win and then Red Bull also wins and Ferrari wins. It is challenging me it is the biggest challenge I have ever had.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/571326b9f773f9d16a9d05a6281ea47731ee2b89/0_250_4931_2959/master/4931.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d140f4b4859b85b4161fa8d38a12fcce","title":"defeat reminds ecb easier to sell winning team","story":"For the romantic rather than the English patriot, the Lord’s Test provided a wonderful outcome.England were humbled by the pace trio of Mohammad Abbas, Hasan Ali and Mohammad Amir. Abbas is a former leather worker from Sialkot, who has been playing in the most uncharted domestic competition in the world for seven or eight years before an excursion as Leicestershire’s overseas player (maybe not the most glamorous of overseas gigs) Hasan’s parents wanted him to get a proper job as a lawyer so they apparently burned his cricket whites Amir is the cricketing prodigal son, misled in his teens, who has tenaciously fought his way back into international cricket.Amir has a certain notoriety, though it was shaming to hear a group of drunken young MCC members chanting “cheat, cheat” when he was running in to bowl on Friday. The other two are unfamiliar to the casual cricket fan. None play in the Indian Premier League because Pakistan cricketers are not welcome there none play Test cricket on their native turf because that is not possible.They are unaccustomed to appearing in Test cricket with more than a few thousand spectators looking on. Yet here they were in front of packed stands at Lord’s clinically dissecting the best that England could offer. One of the best‑resourced sides in the world were being thrashed by an itinerant band of resolute, proud cricketers, making light of their homelessness.Waqar Younis, the great toe‑crushing fast bowler, said this was Pakistan’s best performance at Lord’s, which is high praise since Waqar played in that epic of 1992 when he combined with Wasim Akram to take most of the wickets and produce a critical ninth-wicket partnership of 46 to give their side an enthralling two-wicket victory.That Pakistan side were brimming with household names. Wasim and Waqar aside there was Javed Miandad, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mushtaq Ahmed, Saleem Malik and Rameez Raja in the team. The names of this Pakistan side are not quite so familiar. Waqar is right about the scale of a performance at Lord’s that belies Pakistan’s recent record in Test cricket.Flip the coin and view the match from an English perspective and the picture is so much grimmer. Such a defeat is bewildering given the wealth of our game and all the resources poured into the national team and the development programmes for the Lions and beyond.The England and Wales Cricket Board may be reluctant to acknowledge this since it seems to suit them to talk down interest in the game in this country as a bizarre means of justifying their latest gimmick, but our capacity to host Test cricket is the envy of the world. Especially in the capital the ticket touts do a roaring trade the cost of one day at Lord’s or the Oval would be more than enough to finance five days of a Test anywhere else in the world. Test cricket here is a huge asset.At the ECB there is much talk about the regeneration of the game, although one suspects that in its judgment this coincides with the regeneration of income and another whopping TV deal. This is the justification for a second short‑form game each season, which the ECB wants to remain The\u0026nbspHundred since this is the magic formula that will somehow be attractive to non-cricket lovers, wives and children.There is the belated recognition that taking all cricket away from free-to-air television, which was an option so financially alluring no entrepreneur could reject it, has been damaging to the game and there are now attempts to squeeze remnants of the toothpaste back into the tube. Here is a reminder of the minority view that the most lucrative choice is not always the best one.Perhaps the most potent way to sell and enhance the game has been overlooked recently. It is to have a national side who keep winning, whatever the format. Even when restricted to pay channels a winning side can penetrate the national consciousness we like following winners.However there is little evidence to suggest those in charge are willing to sacrifice their plans to swamp the domestic season with more white-ball cricket throughout the prime times of the English summer. The red ball is destined for the margins of the season the development of red-ball cricketers will be hindered and downgraded. Then if Test cricket here declines further one of our greatest income streams (perhaps it is helpful to use terms readily understood at the ECB) will be jeopardised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa88bff9bf7b3959431affa9c630163efa68f066/9_1_4914_2948/master/4914.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3f58b39a57c287d563342d0a9445fb5","title":"unanswered questions leave chris froome in the shadow of suspicion","story":"While Simon Yates comes out of the Giro d’Italia with credit, there is still uncertainty about Team Sky and their lead rider When Simon Yates cracked so disastrously on the bottom slopes of the Colle delle Finestre while leading the Giro d’Italia last Friday, it looked like the most humiliating of personal catastrophes. Yet it may have been the best thing that has ever happened to the young English rider, at least if he wants to avoid the fate of Chris Froome, the man who caused his downfall. Yates had gone into his 13th day in the leader’s pink jersey holding an advantage of almost half a minute over his nearest pursuer, with the memory of a trio of majestic victories on mountain stages to keep his morale high as he faced the challenge of hanging on for just three more days. He couldn’t do it. As Team Sky marshalled their forces to send a revived Froome spinning up the unmade road leading to the 2,178m summit, Yates had no answer. When Froome slipped away from the leading bunch up the right-hand side of the road, with 80km of the stage and two more major climbs still to go, the young Englishman was looking to his left. When he spotted the danger he found there was nothing left in the legs that had carried him clear of his rivals on those earlier mountains. By the end of stage 19 he had lost the huge amount of 38 minutes and all hope of finishing high in the general classification, never mind of challenging Froome for the victory.  A day later, on the stage from Susa to Cervina, he lost a further 45 minutes and on Sunday in Rome he wound up 21st in the final overall classification, an hour and a quarter behind Froome. But in one respect – perhaps, in the end, the most important of all – his downfall represented an unexpected success. By hitting the wall two days in a row, Yates provided convincing evidence that he is riding clean. Any doper cracking as comprehensively as he did would make sure the same thing did not happen the next day. That’s what Floyd Landis did in the 2006 Tour de France, when he responded to failure on the Galibier and the Croix de Fer by dosing himself with testosterone and returning to take a stage to the ski station at Morzine with an epic solo escape of 120kms. That positioned him to take the yellow jersey in Paris, which he did – until the traces of testosterone showed up and he was stripped of his victory.  Yates’s failure surely banished the doubts cast by the four-month ban handed down in 2016 after his team had failed to complete a TUE form for a controlled asthma medication. Even though the official designation of the offence was “non-intentional doping”, Yates was the first to admit that the shadow would linger, possibly for the remainder of his career. Now, perhaps, it has been removed. Froome would love to be able to say the same, but he chose to race in Italy while last year’s adverse analytical finding for Salbutamol is still under investigation. That is his right, and he claims that the findings will clear him to everyone’s satisfaction. But he cannot blame those who have listened to so many lies from cyclists that they are inclined to make scepticism their first response. For them, the instinctive desire to cheer was stifled long before he had crossed the finish line. His great escape on the Finestre should have been worthy of a place in road cycling’s most romantic feats. The names of Coppi, Merckx and other heroes of various golden ages were widely invoked, but I was reminded, as Froome made his way through the banks of snow at the summit, of the Luxembourg champion Charly Gaul’s astonishing ride through the Dolomites from Merano to Monte Bondone on stage 20 of the 1956 Giro. The Angel of the Mountains, as he was nicknamed, started the day in 24th place overall and launched his attack in unspeakably filthy weather, gradually shedding all his rivals. Many of them abandoned the race altogether on the final climb, during which Gaul’s frozen limbs had to be revived during a brief stop with warm water and a swift massage from his team manager before he remounted to finish the 240km stage more than eight minutes ahead of his nearest pursuer. Two days later, just like Froome, he was in the pink jersey on the final podium.Such are the legends on which cycling history is built (and, yes, we accept that the heroes of the golden ages used primitive doping products to dull the pain). Froome, elbows out and legs whirring as he raced up the shale track before plunging down a descent made treacherous by rivulets of meltwater, was bidding to join them, and to some he did. For once, even his inelegant style, normally an affront to those who prize elegance on a bike, made perfect sense: he grew up riding mountain bikes on trails in Kenya, and here he was putting those techniques to good use. Others, however, look at Team Sky’s tainted record over the past couple of years, involving inconsistent accounts of potentially damaging incidents and medical records that went missing or were never kept. They wonder why, when Froome was asked point-blank during the Giro’s first rest day whether he was still using Salbutamol, he refused to give an answer. Perhaps he did so in the belief that he retains the right to the statutory confidentiality which was ripped apart when the adverse finding was made public by this newspaper. But cycling, and serial grand tour winners in particular, long ago forfeited the right to keep secrets. While it continues to do so, some of us who long to applaud will be keeping our hands in our pockets.

Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01879a1f09968611897e8031e2ee41ace4d0ef9/0_93_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75ba008b4290cf448719bae1c2775129","title":"north korea us summit on track says moon candid talks friend kim jong un","story":"Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that US negotiators were in North Korea for talks ahead of his planned summit with Kim Jong-un – a meeting the US president said was cancelled only three days before.“Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself,” the US president tweeted. “I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!”The Washington Post first reported that the US officials had crossed into North Korea. The Post said Sung Kim, US ambassador to the Philippines, was with Allison Hooker, Korea expert on the White House National Security Council, and a Pentagon official and had met Choe Son Hui, the North Korean vice-foreign minister.Later, a state department spokeswoman said the US delegation was in “ongoing talks with North Korean officials at Panmunjom”, a village on the border between North and South Korea. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said a “pre-advance team” had left for Singapore to work on logistics. Before Trump’s supposed cancellation of the meeting on Thursday, the summit had been set for 12 June.On Saturday, South Korean president Moon Jae-in met Kim Jong-un in a surprise move. On Sunday Moon said Kim was committed to meeting Trump and achieving complete denuclearisation. Amid hugs and smiles, Moon met Kim on the North Korean side of Panmunjom, the site of their first meeting a month earlier. The atmosphere was “just like an ordinary meeting between friends” and the two held “candid talks”, Moon said. A video released by the South Korean presidential office had the audio replaced with dramatic music, showing the two men embracing, both with wide smiles.The spontaneous offer by Kim to meet, and Moon’s quick acceptance, showed how close the two leaders have become. It capped a whirlwind 24 hours of diplomacy as Moon scrambled to salvage the summit between Trump and Kim. On Saturday evening at the White House, as Moon was briefing reporters on his meeting with Kim, Trump suggested a climbdown was possible.“We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Trump said. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at 12 June in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.”Michael Hayden, a former director of the CIA, was less sure Trump would have an advantage. He told ABC’s This Week: “Kim Jong-un knows his programme inside and out. I think he knows what he can concede. I don’t know that the president has done the kind of homework that would allow him to do this.” Discussing the Saturday talks, Moon said Kim “once again committed to complete denuclearisation”. But he repeatedly refused to answer questions on how North Korea would relinquish its nuclear weapons or if it would allow international experts to inspect nuclear facilities, issues which have hung over discussions between Washington and Pyongyang.US officials have demanded North Korea unilaterally disarm before earning concessions on sanctions or a pledge of non-aggression. Pyongyang prefers phased negotiations and concessions. Kim expressed “his fixed will on the historic” meeting with Trump, according to the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency. Photos of the Moon-Kim meeting were printed on the front of the Rodong Sinmun, the Workers’ party newspaper. “It’s strategically smart for Kim to invite Moon for a face to face meeting, it helps portray him in the public eye as a very friendly, diplomacy-oriented statesman,” said Jenny Town, managing editor of monitoring group 38 North. “It really offsets the tone Kim’s regime has put forward with statements threatening nuclear war.”But Town warned there was still a chasm between Washington and Pyongyang on core issues, saying there was little point in holding a summit that lacked substance.“This is not diplomacy, it’s political theatre,” she said. “There is no trust between the two right now, so why would Kim trust any US security guarantee on paper? Trust on both sides need to be built over time and no one should expect Trump to fly to Singapore and leave with all of North Korea’s nukes.” Moon said: “The path to complete denuclearisation and full peace was never going to be an easy one.” He added: “I’m sure we will succeed.”Moon also said he hoped there could be a meeting between North Korea, South Korea and the US to formally end the Korean war, which ceased with an armistice in 1953. He praised Kim for announcing a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, as well as the closing of a nuclear test site this week. The two sides are set to hold “high-level talks” on 1 June as well as military discussions and efforts to set up reunions between ided families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976c2bbc132a348fba2cdc30b647ce8a86aab07e/0_3_2491_1495/master/2491.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e05e9b0831cf258f018487bc995f58a7","title":"colombia presidential elections ivan duque gustavo petro runoff","story":"Iván Duque, a fierce critic of the peace accord, will face-off against former mayor of Bogotá Gustavo Petro in second roundColombians have failed to elect a president outright, setting the stage for a bitter runoff between two frontrunners from opposite ends of the political spectrum, while a peace process with leftist rebels hangs in the balance.While voters were united in their distrust of establishment politicians, the campaign highlighted increasing polarisation, with Duque campaigning on a platform of market-friendly economics and Petro criticising the multinational mining companies that operate in the country.Some voters were also worried that with a leftist at the helm could mean their country follows neighbouring Venezuela toward economic ruin – a crisis that has caused more than a million Venezuelans to flee to Colombia. Petro was once a vocal supporter of Hugo Chávez, the late Venezuelan president whom many blame for that country’s woes.Sunday’s vote took on extra significance, marking the first presidential elections since a peace deal was reached between the government and leftist rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc). That deal formally ended five decades of war that left 220,000 dead and 7 million displaced but failed to win over voters who in late 2016 rejected the deal in a referendum. The peace process was the initiative of outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos, who won the Nobel peace prize for his achievement.Though the deal was amended and ratified in congress, promises of softer sentencing for rebels and guaranteed seats in congress proved a step too far for many Colombians who saw Sunday’s vote as a second referendum.Duque – now the clear favourite to take the presidency in June – is opposed to the peace deal. His mentor and ally, former president Álvaro Uribe, remains a powerful figure in Colombian politics, having long been fiercely critical of the peace process.Petro once belonged to the long-defunct M-19 guerrilla group and supports the deal. But unless he can convince more moderates to swell his movement, his chances of winning next month are remote.Election day began in a leaden mood beneath a leaden sky, with Santos casting his vote in the courtyard of Bogotá’s magnificent neoclassical Congress building, and addressing reporters. “These are the best-attended elections ever,” he said, “in a country closer to peace than it has ever been.”He was followed, according to tradition, by his predecessor Uribe – whom Santos once served as defence minister but who has become his nemesis. Uribe placed his ballot paper and said: “I have voted for Iván Duque, because of his preparation for office, and his programme for security and respect for the law.” Soon afterwards, in the Asunción district on the edge of his electoral fortress in desperately poor barrios in the south of the city, Gustavo Petro arrived, pressing through crowds of supporters, to vote at the San Lucas school, converted to accommodate polling booths. “Uribe, can you hear us? Petro for president!” they chanted, and: “Gustavo, friend, the people are with you!” The candidate moved through his throng to the booth, accompanied by his daughter Antonella who was wearing the yellow colours of Colombia’s football team. “The future of all our sons and daughters depends on who wins this,” he said. “The more people vote, the more free citizens we will have. I promise a humane Colombia We will improve health and education, challenge corruption and pursue peace.” Duque had earlier voted at the National Institute of Pedagogy, as though to demonstrate the bitter polarisation in this country, proceeding to hear midday Mass at Our Lady of Lourdes church in the historic Chapinero district, where his well-heeled supporters packed the aisles. Duque was whisked in via a rear entrance by his armoured convoy, taking a front pew with his wife, Beatriz. A benediction was sung – bizarrely – to the tune of The Beatles Hey Jude and while the audience sat, upright, Duque lowered his head in prayer, before falling – while others stood – to his knees.The peace accord has had a rocky ride in the run-up to this decisive moment. Clause one commits a government to “integrated rural reform”, while clause four demands the voluntary and enforced eradication, and substitution of coca. Both have met with ferocious opposition: 160 indigenous and land rights leaders have been assassinated, and war rages over coca production between government forces and a mesh of mafia interests and Farc dissidents and other criminal syndicates connected to big landowners. The worst violence is in the Tumaco region on the Pacific coast, the most intensive – and contested – coca-growing region in the world. Duque has consistently refused to uphold both clauses, while Petro and Fajardo are committed to continuing the peace process.A final televised debate on Friday night focused almost entirely on the accord. Duque said it had “bamboozled the Colombians”, while Petro insisted: “The peace is not a problem of negotiation with the guerrillas, but an agreement with society to live without violence.” In a debate the previous evening, Fajardo said, aiming at Duque: “That would be a bad thing: a president who does not want peace.” Out in the countryside, the tension has been palpable. Carlos Castilla is one of those working on the front line of the accord’s implementation, for a ision of the agriculture ministry, helping coca growers substitute their crop with licit alternatives. “Peace”, he said, in the tropical wilderness around Tumaco, “is not something you just sign, it is something you build.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c335a0eb394dbfcb75ef53a8d0e461d6f1f4e68/0_192_3132_1879/master/3132.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c05b1808a1fda2abbb61627e8747ad6","title":"italy president sergio mattarella names interim prime minister carlo cottarelli","story":"Sergio Mattarella asks former IMF economist Carlo Cottarelli to form a governmentItaly’s faith in the eurozone is set to be tested in fresh elections in the autumn after the president, Sergio Mattarella, installed an interim prime minister to lead a new government after a bitter falling out with the country’s populist parties.The political crisis that has engulfed Rome threatens to bring about another bitter battle over the future of the EU, two years after the UK voted for Brexit. The uncertainty promped a selloff on Italian markets on Monday.Mattarella, who as president has the power to nominate the head of government and ministers, asked Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund official, to become interim PM after refusing to accept the nomination of Paolo Savona, a Eurosceptic, for the role of finance minister.Mattarella said appointing Savona, 81, who has called Italy’s entry into the euro a “historic mistake”, would have risked the confidence of foreign investors and destabilising the country. Savona had been put forward for the role by the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League, which had been attempting to form a government. The rejection on Sunday night prompted the resignation of Giuseppe Conte, the two parties’ choice to serve as prime minister.The parties’ leaders, Luigi Di Maio of the M5S and Matteo Salvini of the League, expressed outrage at Mattarella’s intervention and, in an extraordinary move, called for a mass mobilisation against the president on 2 June. Di Maio and others called for Mattarella’s impeachment, a move almost unheard of in Italy, but he later backed off from the threat. “I call citizens to mobilise, make yourselves heard, it’s important that you do it right now. We will organise peaceful and symbolic demonstrations,” Di Maio said. He also called on Italians to drape the Italian flag outside their windows in protest against Mattarella.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, praised Mattarella for showing “great spirit of responsibility” in protecting Italy’s “institutional and democratic stability”. Germany’s Angela Merkel said she would be willing to work with any coalition government in Italy, but economic policy had to be dictated by eurozone rules.Asked whether she was concerned, Merkel said: “Look, when there were elections in Greece and Alexis Tsipras was made premier, there were many questions on the table. We spoke with each other over many, many nights, but together we achieved something. But we have to do that task, since Italy is an important member of the EU,” she said.As high-profile figures in Italy, including former newspaper editors, rallied to Mattarella’s defence, there was a mood of shock and disbelief in Rome. Privately, some analysts who were supportive of Mattarella said it was far from clear whether he had made the right moves and whether his actions would inflame populist sentiment at a fragile moment in Italian history.In brief remarks on Monday, Cottarelli sought to play down the political crisis. “The Italian economy is still growing and public finances are under control,” he said. “Dialogue with the EU to defend our interests is essential and we can do better but it has to be constructive.”At the heart of the fight was Mattarella’s contention that Italy would have sent the wrong message by appointing an anti-euro finance minister. Salvini countered that claim, suggesting he had never called for an exit from the euro, despite having long campaigned for Italy to abandon the eurozone.Mattarella’s move was not the first time a president has vetoed a ministerial nomination. It also occurred under the government of Silvio Berlusconi, but was not considered as controversial.Cottarelli will now attempt to form a technocrat government, made up of ministers who have not been popularly elected. In choosing a former IMF official, Mattarella sought to calm nerves in Brussels and around the world about the rise of anti-EU populism in Italy. But Cottarelli is expected to lose a vote of confidence in the parliament, which will then lead to new elections being called, possibly as early as August.The election is expected to be fought along stark battle lines: whether the country is for or against continued inclusion in the eurozone, at a time when Brussels – and the fiscal constraints it has imposed – is partly blamed for Italy’s stagnant growth and high rate of unemployment.While it is clear that both Di Maio and Salvini have consistently questioned Italy’s place in the eurozone, and will probably campaign in favour of a more combative approach towards Brussels, it is unclear who in Italy’s political class will make a strong case for the EU and the euro.“The cleavage is between those who support sovereignty and those who support Europe. Who will represent the case for Europe? That is the real question,” said Sergio Fabbrini, the director of Luiss School of Government.It is a stunning development less than two weeks after the M5S and the League had agreed a common agenda to form what would have been western Europe’s first populist government.Beppe Grillo, the M5S founder, pointed a finger of blame at the markets. “People do not talk, they are depressed, because there is someone who speaks in the place of millions of Italians: the market today is the pseudonym of the most disheartening capitalism and of predation that we have in Italy,” he wrote on his blog.

He was also offered a job with the Paris sapeurs pompiers, the city’s fire and emergency service.Macron gave Gassama a medal for an act of “bravery and devotion”, signed by the police prefect and declaring the French Republic’s gratitude.Filmed in the gilded reception room of the palace, Gassama hesitantly described seeing the child hanging on to the balcony railing at around 8pm on Saturday when he was on his way out. He had acted “without thinking”, he said.“There were people shouting and honking their horns … I didn’t think of anything, I ran across the road directly to save him. Thank God I saved him.”He said he only realised what he had done after he hauled the child to safety.“My legs went wobbly when I got inside the flat,” he said.Gassama, who has nine brothers and sisters, told BFM TV that when he had the child in his arms he asked “why did you do that?”. But the child did not say anything. Gassama said he only fully realised what he had done when he was in the apartment, looking down.Gassama was accompanied to the palace by his brother Diaby. Asked if he had anything to say to the president, Gassama seemed overwhelmed, so Diaby replied: “We want to be officialised. We have no papers but we want them so we can work in good conditions and we need homes.”Afterwards, faced with a barrage of television cameras and journalists, Gassama seemed lost for words.“He gave me a present,” he said of Macron. “It’s the first time I’ve had anything like this. I’m very happy.”Macron tweeted that in recognition of Gassama’s “heroic act”, his status in France would be made official with a carte de séjour (residency card) “as quickly as possible”. The president also invited Gassama – who has been living without official papers in Paris since he arrived from Mali in September – to put in a request for naturalisation.The interior minister, Gérard Collomb, confirmed that he would personally ensure Gassama’s request would be accepted.The government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux tweeted: “This act of immense bravery, faithful to the values of solidarity of our republic, should open the door to him to our national community.”The city’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, and her deputies vowed to help the young man in his attempts to remain in France.In the footage recorded from the street, a man and woman in the neighbouring flat can be seen spotting the boy from their balcony. The man grabs the child’s right arm but appears unable to pull him to safety because of a iding wall between the balconies.Gassama said he asked the child how he came to be hanging from the balcony in the 18th arrondissement in the north of Paris.“He didn’t answer. I asked where his mother was and he said she had gone to a party,” he told journalists.The father of the child was detained overnight for alleged parental neglect, and is to appear in court in September. Police said the child’s mother was not in Paris at the time of the incident and the boy was now in the care of social services.On Monday, the deputy president of the far-right Front National, Nicolas Bay, sounded a more cynical note about Gassama’s residency status. “If you tell me, we’ll make that one official because of his act of bravery and we’ll expel all the others’, I’ll sign up to that,” Bay told France 2 television.Only a handful of undocumented migrants have their status regularised in France for acts of public service or “exceptional talent”. In 2015, Lassana Bathily, also from Mali, was given asylum after helping hostages taken by the terrorist Amedy Coulibaly at the Hyper-Cacher supermarket, and assisting police and special forces to end the siege.The French documentary maker and commentator Raphaël Glucksmann wrote on his Facebook page: “Like everyone else, I admire the bravery of Mamoudou Gassama. But I dream of a country where it won’t be necessary to put one’s own life at risk scaling a building to save the life of a child in order to be treated like a human being when one is a migrant.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"May urged to legislate for terminations in absence of devolved Stormont institutions\u0026lsquoThe South has taken a big leap and . . . the North will actually feel it\u0026rsquos been left behind\u0026rsquoMan in his 30s died after collision on N4 dual carriageway near MullingarChief Justice hails design and development of refurbished building and improved facilitiesMichael Burrows says repeal of Eighth shows Irish society \u0026lsquodislikes hypocrisy\u0026rsquoRemains of Zdzislaw Sokolowski found in flat on Main Street, Charlestown on SundayPatrick Fitzpatrick (33), who played Zumo Bishop, gets 12 months probation for assaultStudent (24) was murdered after being abducted in Enniskerry on Saturday, May 19thSuccessful stud farm to open to public this summer as part of Co Tipperary initiativeWoman asked if she liked eating animals as they comprise chief meat sources for Asians14-year-old, found dead in derelict Dublin farmhouse, to be cremated on ThursdayWestern counties forecast to have best of conditions on TuesdayBoris Johnson\u0026rsquos sister had praised Sky News for reporting in \u0026lsquoclear English\u0026rsquo for \u0026lsquomainland UK\u0026rsquoZoltan Huba Henn accused of fraudulently obtaining \u0026euro22,000 from investorTwo women advertised their household cleaning service on FacebookLegislation removing baptism barrier to be discussed in D\u0026aacuteil this weekJudge says 2008 crash \u0026lsquounprecedented\u0026rsquo but not an excuse for charges ex-Anglo chief facesThe 76km cycle route between Galway and Clifden has been held up by land access issues"},{"url":null,"title":"joyous and tearful scenes in dublin castle as eighth amendment to be repealed","story":"  May 27, 2018Ireland has voted No to tribalism and fear in overwhelming decision to remove the Eighth   May 27, 2018Thirty-five years after its introduction, Eighth Amendment repealed after bitter campaign   May 28, 2018Cheers and tears greeted the verdict \u0026ndash a just reward for decades fighting the good fight "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3510346.1527435312!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may told sidestepping backstop formula a non runner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: she  has been suggesting  that the customs provisions suggested in the backstop should be extended on a UK-wide basis to obviate the need for any separate treatment of Northern Ireland goods. Photograph: PA Wire Theresa May has strung herself and her government up on a DUP hook from which there is apparently no escaping. Short, that is, of telling the unionists she has no choice but to make a commitment to the possibility of customs controls on the Irish Sea to secure the greater objective of a frictionless border between North and South.Last week she was told by the EU in Brexit talks in no uncertain terms that her complex formula for sidestepping the “backstop” commitment she made in December – or, rather, reinterpreting it - is a complete non-runner. She must now go back to the drawing board and produce a new way of operationalising the backstop that reflects the uncomfortable promises made in December. This backstop ensures no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland in the event there is no agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border. And she must do so fast as a June summit is looming. How she ever thought it would be a runner is not clear, as one senior EU official close to the talks admitted. “You are not the only one to be confused here,” he told this correspondent at a post-talks briefing. Mrs May has struggled with the reality that in December, in order to demonstrate “sufficient progress” and see talks move on to their next stage, the backstop commitment was conceded as a guaranteed fallback to the EU for the Withdrawal Agreement in case longer-term talks failed to produce a borderless EU-UK trade deal. It is now enshrined in draft, unagreed form in a special protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement.Under pressure from unionists opposed to controls on the Irish Sea – inevitable if Northern Ireland is treated as a separate case – Mrs May has delayed and fudged in the Northern Ireland strand of talks in the hope that the guarantee might not be necessary. But the EU wants a firm legal commitment by June. And there is no sign of an alternative long-term solution yet.And May has been suggesting in recent weeks that the customs provisions suggested in the backstop should be extended on a UK-wide basis to obviate the need for any separate treatment of Northern Ireland goods. This would be on a strictly time-limited basis, she insisted, so that the UK’s ambitions to sign separate trade deals would not be unduly inhibited. Two problems: the time limit undoes the guarantee element of the backstop and the UK was only committing to the customs element of the backstop, not its full regulatory alignment. Absent the latter there can be no frictionless Border.The UK had refused to discuss the backstop issue in the Ireland talks strand last week, but, to the surprise of EU negotiators, sought to raise it in the “future relationship” discussions in another room. “We have not addressed these issues in the context in which they need to be addressed,” the EU official complained.“They did, however, in the beginning of the meeting on the future partnership,” he said, “refer to the fact that Mrs May remains determined to address the Irish Border issue through the overall EU-UK relationship.“They said that they are currently discussing only the customs dimension of the backstop and that they are looking at making that EU-UK-wide. At the same time they said that they recognise that the Article 50 agreement (Withdrawal Agreement) protocol could not set out the permanent long-term EU-UK customs relationship.” So was the official, he confessed. Progress can’t be made to the June “sufficient progress” talks yardstick unless, he insisted, “we have a recognition that the backstop has to be Northern Ireland-specific. And we do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to that.“And we need to have the recognition that regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland is the key to avoiding a border. “Progress at this stage seems elusive – substantive progress even more so.” The EU now awaits, within two weeks at most, an explanation in writing of how the agreed backstop will be operationalised and the legal language for it for the Withdrawal Agreement. Arlene Foster can expect an uncomfortable call from Downing Street.As for the longer term future relationship discussions on trade and customs, we are still awaiting a British position. These too require agreed text for October, a broad political outline to accompany the Withdrawal Treaty. On this time is also running out, and the UK will have to come off the fence soon.

Video: Kathleen Harris Enda O\u0027Dowd \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA single rose is held aloft at Dublin Castle as the crowd gathered to celebrate the Yes vote. Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

His British visa expired last month and sources have told Reuters it was taking longer than usual to get it renewed. The British government has declined to comment on his case.The Ynet website, which belongs to Israel’s biggest selling daily, Yedioth Aharonoth, said Mr Abramovich, who is Jewish, travelled to Tel Aviv on Monday and received documents confirming his status as an Israeli citizen.An Israeli immigration ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on the report, citing inidual privacy, but a spokeswoman for the Population Administration, which oversees border control, confirmed that Mr Abramovich was in Israel. A spokesman for Mr Abramovich also declined to comment on the report.Israel grants citizenship to any Jew wishing to move there, and a passport can be issued immediately. Israeli passport holders can enter Britain without a visa for short stays, although they require visas to work there.Relations between Moscow and London have been strained since the poisoning of former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal in Britain in March, an act Britain has blamed on Russia. The Kremlin denies any involvement.Mr Abramovich has been a regular visitor to Israel and Ynet said he had bought a property that was formerly a hotel, in an old Tel Aviv neighbourhood close to the Mediterranean shore. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3511683.1527530274!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland asks eu to ensure aid to people of gaza","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney: “We should be looking at a more comprehensive engagement between the EU and the US on the Middle East, more broadly and indeed on other issues like trade across the Atlantic.” Photograph: Cyril ByrneIn the wake of the killings of more than 100 Palestinians on the Gaza-Israel border since March, Ireland has appealed to fellow EU member states to step up their engagement with the region.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday that the first priority should be ensuring that assistance gets into Gaza and the second focus should be “on trying to make progress on broader political solutions that can reduce tensions”.He warned that “many of us have been predicting that in the absence of new political initiatives we will just see new cycles of violence driven by frustration and hardship”.In a discussion on Gaza that Mr Coveney had sought, ministers reaffirmed their commitment to resolutions based on a two-state solution and their opposition to illegal settlements in Palestinian territory. And they are understood to have begun to explore new ways for the EU to assist in promoting dialogue.\u0026nbspThat could include, he said, assisting Egypt in its attempts to broker reconciliation between the Palestinian groups Fatah and Hamas, and working with investment programmes for the Palestinian territories.Mr Coveney said there was much concern about the funding gap in the UN’s Palestinian relief organisation Unrwa – in part the result of a US decision to defund the organisation. It is responsible for supporting basic healthcare and education needs for millions of PalestiniansBut “there was recognition that while economic assistance is important, really what is required is a more focused political solution and at the moment we haven’t got that”, he said. At least 121 Palestinians have been shot dead by Israeli forces, and thousands injured, since protests began at the Gaza-Israel border on March 30th. EU leaders are deeply concerned about what the shape of a long-awaited peace plan from US president Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, will look like.Mr Coveney is travelling to Ramallah and Jordan next week on a fact-finding visits. \u0026nbspThe growing policy gulf between the EU and US – on the Iran deal, trade, Jerusalem and the whole theme of multilateralism – was a central part of ministers’ discussions, which saw strong confirmation of the EU’s willingness to go ahead with the Iran nuclear deal if Tehran remains committed.Mr Trump has pulled the US out of the 2015 deal between Iran and a number of world powers. Under the deal, Iran signed up to curbs on its nuclear activities in return for an easing of sanctions. The EU foreign ministers are reported to have advanced a number of means of combating US secondary sanctions against EU businesses trading with Iran. Mr Coveney said he got support for his call to adopt a more all-encompassing approach to dialogue and the transatlantic relationship.“I made the point that rather than trying to deal with inidual problems through separate dialogue and negotiation, whether it’s Syria, the Middle East peace process, Iran, or Yemen, that really we should be looking at a more comprehensive engagement between the EU and the US on the Middle East, more broadly and indeed on other issues like trade across the Atlantic,” he said.“Instead of Iran resulting in less dialogue between the EU and the US . . . in my view it really calls for more dialogue and co-operation. If the EU and US are moving in different directions on multiple policy areas, that is not a recipe for stability.”Following the May 20th presidential elections in Venezuela, which they described as lacking credibility and inclusiveness, the ministers called for new elections to be held “in accordance with internationally recognised democratic standards and the Venezuelan constitutional order”.They warned that the EU was preparing new sanctions against Venezuela, likely to extend the list of travel bans on officials closely linked to the regime of President Nicolás Maduro.And the ministers emphasised the importance of assisting a representative and credible election process in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo. \u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3511678.1527529738!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"socialists scramble to gather support for motion against mariano rajoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Spanish Socialist Party announced on May 25th   the presentation of a motion of no confidence against the Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy. Photograph: EPAChema MoyaThe Spanish Socialist Party is struggling to gather support for a no-confidence motion it has brought against prime minister Mariano Rajoy and which is due to be debated in parliament on Thursday and Friday.Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez requested the motion on Friday, citing the torrent of corruption scandals that have plagued the governing Popular Party (PP). On Thursday the high court found the PP guilty of involvement in a bribes-for-contracts network.The speaker of congress, Ana Pastor, spoke to Mr Sánchez before announcing that the debate will begin this Thursday and conclude the next day with a vote on whether to remove the prime minister from office.“This no-confidence motion was ethically necessary in the context of a court sentence which states in black and white things of enormous seriousness that affect the prime minister,” said Margarita Robles, spokeswoman for the Socialist Party.If her party’s motion is successful, Mr Sánchez will become prime minister. He has said that if that happens, he will call elections although he has not said when.However, his bid to remove Mr Rajoy from office, which requires an absolute majority, faces difficulties in Spain’s fragmented parliament.So far, the only major party openly supporting the initiative is the leftist Podemos, although it is consulting its members for a final decision ahead of the debate.“It is essential and urgent to remove the PP from government,” tweeted Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias, who comfortably survived an internal party confidence motion of his own last week. He added that his priority is “a progressive government with a consensual agenda focused on regeneration and social rescue.”It is not clear how much the Socialists would negotiate future policies with Podemos, or indeed whether they would be willing to share power with the anti-austerity party. However, the biggest single obstacle to the success of the no-confidence motion is the centre-right Ciudadanos, which instead is calling for a snap general election.“Corruption has ended the legislature,” said Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera. If Mr Rajoy refuses to call an election in the coming days, Mr Rivera added, he will call on the Socialists to withdraw their motion and present another, fronted by an independent candidate for prime minister who could lead the country until an election in the autumn.Ciudadanos, which does not have enough seats to present its own no-confidence motion, has been the PP’s main parliamentary support, helping it pass the 2018 budget last week. However, it is currently leading many polls and the recent corruption verdict appears to have persuaded it to break with Mr Rajoy’s conservatives.Without the support of Ciudadanos, the Socialists would need to secure the backing of several Basque and Catalan nationalist parties. With Mr Sánchez insisting he is not negotiating terms with any parliamentary group ahead of Friday’s vote, their backing is far from certain.Despite the current turmoil, government spokesman Íñigo Méndez de Vigo said Mr Rajoy had no intention of stepping aside.“The prime minister will not resign because he believes that Spain needs stability and it gets stability from the government, not from a no-confidence motion,” he said.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares. At minimum it is adding 3 million tonnes of rice. We have also developed SUB1 varieties with salt, drought and stagnant flooding tolerance.”Biofortified beans in RwandaDfid is now the biggest funder of HarvestPlus, whose work into fortified crops was started in 2003. Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM. The salutary lesson on this is “golden rice”, a GM strain engineered to boost vitamin A. More than a decade after it was hailed as a potential game-changer, its progress to farmers’ fields has stalled in a blizzard of regulation and public opposition.If the next green revolution is to come, harnessing nature rather than genetically modifying it may prove to be quickest and most efficient route.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security From chateaux to Roman aqueducts, French landmarks to be saved with funds from UK-style lottery \u0026#39heritage draw\u0026#39Cat lovers at Google are to blame for dwindling burrowing owl population, say wildlife activistsGender pay gap in medical field under government reviewBritish circus trainer fights to keep beloved elephant in her Spanish gardenGirl made false accusation of rape after her ex-boyfriend rejected herCatalonia independence fight spills onto the beaches of BarcelonaUK in \u0026#39crab crisis\u0026#39 as restaurants forced to pull dishes from menusRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedProsecco no longer considered a luxury, experts sayNicola Sturgeon: Theresa May has to concede that Britain must remain in a customs unionFamily of graduate killed on her birthday say \u0026#39light in our life is extinguished\u0026#39 Japan\u0026#39s 77,000 Buddhist temples to offer rooms to rent after law changeNew Zealand prepares to slaughter 15,000 cows in disease cull South Korean president may join Singapore summit as Donald Trump hails North\u0026#39s \u0026#39brilliant potential\u0026#39Israel sees an opportunity to drive a Iran out of Syria as Russia looks to its own interestsItaly\u0026#39s next government will take fight to Brussels and support Britain over Brexit, vows leading Five Star politicianYoung farmer breaks her arm in arm-wrestling matchMan arrested on suspicion of murdering woman and 11-year-old girlInside the luxury Canadian cabin that Meghan and Harry are rumoured to have chosen for their honeymoonAbortion clinic buffer zones set \u0026#39dangerous precedent\u0026#39 for freedom of speech, campaigners sayMurder inquiry launched after man killed in hit and runWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"giant panda cub makes first appearance","story":"A giant panda cub has made her first public debut aged five-months-old.

team denies claims match fixing test against","story":"Aneel Munawar in undercover recordings The England cricket team has been forced to deny outrageous match-fixing claims after a documentary alleged that a Test match against India was rigged. In an unprecedented statement, the English Cricket Board (ECB) said that there is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever in the face of claims of spot fixing during the 2016 match in Chennai. Tom Harrison, Chief Executive Officer of the ECB, said that they had discussed the documentary claims with all of the players, adding: They emphatically deny the allegations, have stated categorically that the claims are false and they have our full support.“Neither ECB nor the International Cricket Council (ICC) is aware any credible evidence connecting any England players to any form of corruption.An undercover journalist, posing as a businessman looking to place bets on the match, filmed a match fixer claiming that he had three England players with whom he arranged spot fixes during the Test in 2016.Aneel Munawar, who is accused of working for organised crime syndicate D Company, was recorded boasting that he has been fixing matches for six or seven years and can fix up to 60 to 70 per-cent of matches with players in every team. I\u0027m telling you, each script I give you will happen, happen and happen, he said. Joe Root, England\u0026#39s Test Captain, described the allegations as \u0026#39ridiculous\u0026#39Just before the 2016 match began he called a middle-man working for the reporters to tell him how players would perform at certain points in the game. Though his predictions have not been revealed, Al Jazeera\u0027s documentary Cricket’s Match Fixers claimed that they were accurate. The England  players alleged to have been involved, who have not been named, told the documentary makers that they categorically deny allegations made by a source who is a known criminal.The fixers were also caught discussing  plans to rig the outcome of England’s first Test in Sri Lanka, scheduled to begin on November 6, by doctoring the pitch to make it impossible for the contest to end in a draw.Tharange Indika, a groundsman at Galle International Stadium, was suspended by the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket whilst investigations take place. He denies all allegations against him.\u0027Spot fixing\u0027, which hit the headlines eight years ago when three Pakistan players were jailed over the practice in one of the sport\u0027s biggest scams, has become increasingly common in recent years as it is much harder to detect than throwing an entire match and provides more opportunity for bets. One former international cricketer previously accused of match fixing, whose identity was concealed, told Al Jazeera: They give them expensive gifts, like  Rolex watches. They give them houses, flats, cars.They send beautiful girls to the players, like models, so they get involved with them.He claimed that cheating players could earn up to £200,000 a game and were trapped into fixing matches. Joe Root, England\u0027s Test Captain, described the allegations against his team as ridiculous. I am aware that there is a documentary and it is outrageous that our players have been accused. All the players have the full backing of the ECB, he told a press conference. He said that they are concentrating on the cricket ahead of the second Test against Pakistan after losing Sunday\u0027s first Test, adding: “All the players have been briefed by the ECB, and been told there\u0027s absolutely nothing to worry about.Similar claims have been made against two Australian players in relation to their match against India at Ranchi in March 2017. Cricket bosses there have issued an equally vociferous denials. The ICC has launched an investigation into the claims made by the documentary, saying that it takes them very seriously.Repeated requests for disclosure of full evidence from the 18 month investigation have not yet been complied with, the governing body said. Munawar has declined to comment since undercover reporters revealed their identity. From chateaux to Roman aqueducts, French landmarks to be saved with funds from UK-style lottery \u0026#39heritage draw\u0026#39Cat lovers at Google are to blame for dwindling burrowing owl population, say wildlife activistsGender pay gap in medical field under government reviewBritish circus trainer fights to keep beloved elephant in her Spanish gardenGirl made false accusation of rape after her ex-boyfriend rejected herCatalonia independence fight spills onto the beaches of BarcelonaUK in \u0026#39crab crisis\u0026#39 as restaurants forced to pull dishes from menusRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedProsecco no longer considered a luxury, experts sayNicola Sturgeon: Theresa May has to concede that Britain must remain in a customs unionFamily of graduate killed on her birthday say \u0026#39light in our life is extinguished\u0026#39 Japan\u0026#39s 77,000 Buddhist temples to offer rooms to rent after law changeNew Zealand prepares to slaughter 15,000 cows in disease cull South Korean president may join Singapore summit as Donald Trump hails North\u0026#39s \u0026#39brilliant potential\u0026#39Israel sees an opportunity to drive a Iran out of Syria as Russia looks to its own interestsItaly\u0026#39s next government will take fight to Brussels and support Britain over Brexit, vows leading Five Star politicianYoung farmer breaks her arm in arm-wrestling matchMan arrested on suspicion of murdering woman and 11-year-old girlInside the luxury Canadian cabin that Meghan and Harry are rumoured to have chosen for their honeymoonAbortion clinic buffer zones set \u0026#39dangerous precedent\u0026#39 for freedom of speech, campaigners sayMurder inquiry launched after man killed in hit and runWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/27/TELEMMGLPICT000164689909_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"hailstones size pigeon eggs devastate bordeaux vineyards","story":"A violent storm left vines damaged and without leaves in this vineyard in Macau, near Bordeaux Hailstorms have devastated thousands of acres of prime Bordeaux vineyards, prompting the French government to promise support for winegrowers, some of whom have lost their entire crop.Cyril Giresse, a winegrower, said hailstones “the size of pigeons’ eggs” destroyed grape buds and left vines bare on Saturday.“The storm lasted only about 15 minutes, but in some places, there’s nothing left at all,” said Mr Giresse, who runs the Château Gravettes Samonac in Bordeaux’s Côtes de Bourg appellation. “No leaves, no grapes, just the vines stripped as if the grapes had all been picked.”Jean-Dominique Château, another claret producer, said: “I’ve got nothing left. I’ve been growing grapes for 33 years and this is the worst storm I’ve ever seen. Last year we lost 40 per cent of our crop to hail but this year it’s going to be an even worse disaster.”A series of storms in the Bordeaux region has ruined dozens of vineyardsStéphane Travert, the agriculture minister, said the government was assessing the extent of losses and would aid wine producers. “We’ll take the necessary measures and we’re ready to meet Bordeaux winemakers,” he said.Franck Jullion, the head of the producers’ association in the “Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux” appellation, said: “It’s a desolate vista, as if the vines had gone back to winter. Estates hit by frost last year will not recover. We’re going to need a lot of support and solidarity.”Saint-Emilion, one of the most prestigious Bordeaux appellations, was spared, but parts of Médoc were badly hit, as were Cognac brandy producers in the Charente and Charente-Maritime departments.Didier Gontier, director of the Côtes de Bourg appellation, said: “Winegrowers say they’ve got no vines left for next year so this is going to affect two years of production.”  Bordeaux produces more than 700 million bottles of claret a year,Bordeaux is France’s largest wine-growing area, with about 300,000 acres of vineyards producing more than 700 million bottles of claret a year, ranging from cheap table wines to some of the world’s most acclaimed and expensive vintages.French wine and spirits exports amounted to more than £11 billion last year. Wine industry leaders have opposed moves to tighten 1991 laws restricting alcohol advertising. President Emmanuel Macron has backed them, saying he drinks wine at lunch and dinner. He has infuriated doctors by minimising public health concerns over wine and arguing that spirits and beer pose more of a problem because they are favoured by binge-drinkers.Please review our commenting policyFrom chateaux to Roman aqueducts, French landmarks to be saved with funds from UK-style lottery \u0026#39heritage draw\u0026#39Cat lovers at Google are to blame for dwindling burrowing owl population, say wildlife activistsGender pay gap in medical field under government reviewBritish circus trainer fights to keep beloved elephant in her Spanish gardenGirl made false accusation of rape after her ex-boyfriend rejected herCatalonia independence fight spills onto the beaches of BarcelonaUK in \u0026#39crab crisis\u0026#39 as restaurants forced to pull dishes from menusRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedProsecco no longer considered a luxury, experts sayNicola Sturgeon: Theresa May has to concede that Britain must remain in a customs unionFamily of graduate killed on her birthday say \u0026#39light in our life is extinguished\u0026#39 Japan\u0026#39s 77,000 Buddhist temples to offer rooms to rent after law changeNew Zealand prepares to slaughter 15,000 cows in disease cull South Korean president may join Singapore summit as Donald Trump hails North\u0026#39s \u0026#39brilliant potential\u0026#39Israel sees an opportunity to drive a Iran out of Syria as Russia looks to its own interestsItaly\u0026#39s next government will take fight to Brussels and support Britain over Brexit, vows leading Five Star politicianYoung farmer breaks her arm in arm-wrestling matchMan arrested on suspicion of murdering woman and 11-year-old girlInside the luxury Canadian cabin that Meghan and Harry are rumoured to have chosen for their honeymoonAbortion clinic buffer zones set \u0026#39dangerous precedent\u0026#39 for freedom of speech, campaigners sayMurder inquiry launched after man killed in hit and runWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000164821264_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside luxury canadian cabin meghan harry rumoured have chosen","story":"Canoes at the Beauvert Lake boathouse at the Fairmont Jasper Park LodgeIf there’s one thing royal-watchers love more than a royal wedding, it’s a royal honeymoon, and the travel and celebrity press is abuzz with rumours about precisely where newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will choose to be holed up with Netflix and champagne. There were rumours of a mini-moon in Ireland, in all likelihood at the gloriously eccentric 18th manor Ballyfin Demesne, where Kim Kardashian and Kanye West honeymooned in 2015. Namibia was also hotly tipped, with a specific nod to Hoanib Valley Camp, a luxury tented conservation-oriented camp in a particularly remote corner of a lesser-visited African destination.

including Mii-dera, a famous Buddhist complex dating back to the seventh century, not far from Kyoto – with plans to boost this to 1,000 in three years.In addition to offering accommodation, many temples will offer a unique cultural insight into Buddhist life, with some offering guests the chance to try zazen meditation, sutra writing or attend early morning prayers as well as sample Buddhist cuisine.“Terahaku aims to help tourists understand traditional Japanese culture and history,” a Waqoo spokesperson told the .Terahaku is one of a raft of accommodation innovations that have emerged in Japan in recent years, in response to the nation’s widely reported shortage of beds in the run up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.A record number of tourists are holidaying in Japan, with nearly 28.7 million visiting in 2017 and the government apparently on track to hit its target of 40 million visitors by 2020.The government is reportedly keen for visitors to tap into alternative forms of accommodation, according to Reuters – including love hotels – in a bid to limit room shortages.The accommodation website Booking has reportedly seen love hotel bookings rise 48 per cent in the past year and expects the trend to continue as the 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2020 Tokyo Olympics approach.From chateaux to Roman aqueducts, French landmarks to be saved with funds from UK-style lottery \u0026#39heritage draw\u0026#39Cat lovers at Google are to blame for dwindling burrowing owl population, say wildlife activistsGender pay gap in medical field under government reviewBritish circus trainer fights to keep beloved elephant in her Spanish gardenGirl made false accusation of rape after her ex-boyfriend rejected herCatalonia independence fight spills onto the beaches of BarcelonaUK in \u0026#39crab crisis\u0026#39 as restaurants forced to pull dishes from menusRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedProsecco no longer considered a luxury, experts sayNicola Sturgeon: Theresa May has to concede that Britain must remain in a customs unionFamily of graduate killed on her birthday say \u0026#39light in our life is extinguished\u0026#39 New Zealand prepares to slaughter 15,000 cows in disease cull South Korean president may join Singapore summit as Donald Trump hails North\u0026#39s \u0026#39brilliant potential\u0026#39Israel sees an opportunity to drive a Iran out of Syria as Russia looks to its own interestsItaly\u0026#39s next government will take fight to Brussels and support Britain over Brexit, vows leading Five Star politicianYoung farmer breaks her arm in arm-wrestling matchMan arrested on suspicion of murdering woman and 11-year-old girlInside the luxury Canadian cabin that Meghan and Harry are rumoured to have chosen for their honeymoonAbortion clinic buffer zones set \u0026#39dangerous precedent\u0026#39 for freedom of speech, campaigners sayMurder inquiry launched after man killed in hit and runGirl Guides to learn how to be good with money with new \u0026#34saver badge\u0026#34We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon theresa may has concede britain must remain","story":"Nicola Sturgeon with Michel BarnierNicola Sturgeon has been accused of talking down the importance of the UK market after she claimed Theresa May would have to concede “sooner or later” that Britain must remain in a customs union with the EU.She said it was the only credible option after Brexit, adding that the Prime Minister was only listening to mad Brexiteers” - naming Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, and the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg.The First Minister claimed the UK Government’s position of pulling out of the single market and the customs union was “unsustainable”.She was speaking in Brussels after meeting Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, on a trip her political opponents claimed was about “weaponising” Britain’s departure from the EU to help her push for another independence referendum.Ms Sturgeon said: “It is important for Scotland to trade freely across the UK. It’s vital for the rest of the UK to trade freely with Scotland.Nicola Sturgeon met the chief EU negotiator for Brexit in Brussels“But it’s really important for Scotland also to continue to be able to trade freely within the single market. The single market is eight times the size of the UK market, so we shouldn’t have to be in a position where we are having to choose one or the other.”In the audience event with the website Politico, she also argued a customs union was important to prevent the return to a hard border in Northern Ireland, adding that without similar arrangements for Scotland it could be left at a competitive disadvantage”.She told BBC Scotland the “clock is ticking” and said the longer it took for the UK to reach a sensible position, the greater the risk of a “no deal” outcome, which would be in “absolutely nobody’s interest”.Asked whether she thought there would be sufficient clarity on Brexit by the autumn to make a call on indyref2, she said: “Clearly, there are lots of issues that have to be resolved between now and then, but I don’t hear anything from the UK Government or indeed from the EU side of this negotiation that is moving away from there being a fairly detailed political statement about the future relationship in the autumn. So that remains my working assumption.”She said she would give her view on what she thought the “correct thing is to do at that stage”. She also said that if Mrs May refused to support a referendum, as she did last year, she would “confront” the issue when it arose.Annie Wells, the Scottish Conservative MSP, said her comments on the single market were “plainly misleading” as the SNP government’s own figures showed the “UK single market” was four times more important to Scotland than the EU.She also criticised the First Minister for claiming the independence referendum in 2014 was a more pleasant experience than the Brexit vote.Ms Wells said this was a “fantasy analysis”, adding: “The behaviour throughout that campaign, and since, from some of her most fervent supporters was appalling, and the SNP would do well to confront that.”The Tories also said the First Minister was distancing herself from some of the key findings of the SNP’s Sustainable Growth Commission report - on the economy of an independent Scotland - which was published on Friday.Ms Sturgeon described proposals for a separate Scotland keeping the pound informally as “recommendations” rather than policy.Meanwhile, Jim Fairlie, a former SNP deputy leader, and George Kerevan, a former MP, both attacked its findings.Mr Fairlie said the policy meant a second referendum would be lost before it started, while Mr Kerevan said it had let down the SNP’s working-class base.Please review our commenting policyComment: A grand deal between Donald Trump and North Korea could be the worst possible outcome From chateaux to Roman aqueducts, French landmarks to be saved with funds from UK-style lottery \u0026#39heritage draw\u0026#39Cat lovers at Google are to blame for dwindling burrowing owl population, say wildlife activistsGender pay gap in medical field under government reviewBritish circus trainer fights to keep beloved elephant in her Spanish gardenGirl made false accusation of rape after her ex-boyfriend rejected herCatalonia independence fight spills onto the beaches of BarcelonaUK in \u0026#39crab crisis\u0026#39 as restaurants forced to pull dishes from menusRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedProsecco no longer considered a luxury, experts sayFamily of graduate killed on her birthday say \u0026#39light in our life is extinguished\u0026#39 Japan\u0026#39s 77,000 Buddhist temples to offer rooms to rent after law changeNew Zealand prepares to slaughter 15,000 cows in disease cull South Korean president may join Singapore summit as Donald Trump hails North\u0026#39s \u0026#39brilliant potential\u0026#39Israel sees an opportunity to drive a Iran out of Syria as Russia looks to its own interestsItaly\u0026#39s next government will take fight to Brussels and support Britain over Brexit, vows leading Five Star politicianYoung farmer breaks her arm in arm-wrestling matchMan arrested on suspicion of murdering woman and 11-year-old girlInside the luxury Canadian cabin that Meghan and Harry are rumoured to have chosen for their honeymoonAbortion clinic buffer zones set \u0026#39dangerous precedent\u0026#39 for freedom of speech, campaigners sayMurder inquiry launched after man killed in hit and runWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"prosecco no longer considered luxury experts say","story":"Sales of the Italian fizz have boomed in recent years as it successfully overtook Champagne as a toast at weddings, birthdays and other special occasionsBritain has reached peak prosecco because it is no longer seen as a luxury, figures suggest.Sales of the Italian fizz have boomed in recent years as it successfully overtook Champagne as a toast at weddings, birthdays and other special occasions.But now, for the first time, Prosecco\u0027s seemingly unstoppable climb is slowing, according to accountancy group UHY Hacker Young.Last year saw the smallest sales rise since 2011, amid a rising cost of imports from Italy and France because of sterling\u0027s weakness, according to the report, it found.Some 35.8 gallons of sparkling wine were sold over the past year, an increase of 5 per cent on the previous 12 months.UHY Hacker Young suggested that Prosecco may be suffering from brand overexposure through overstocking at supermarkets.Prosecco has lost its luxurious edge due to over marketing in supermarkets, experts saySpokesman James Simmonds said: A 5 per cent increase in sales is not at all bad but that comes after several years of double-digit growth.Unless the industry can revitalise its image this year, we may now be reaching \u0027peak Prosecco\u0027. It is hard for a luxury product to make the leap into the mass market without losing its reputation for exclusivity.A lot of English wine producers are now vying to capture the space left, as Prosecco moves to the mainstream.Meanwhile the English wine market is booming and gearing up to give Prosecco and Champagne a run for their money in the global market.Partly fueled by business experts looking for a change of scenery, a record 64 new wine producers and vineyards launched their businesses last year, a 73pc increase compared to 2015.Wine producers in England are expected to plant more than 1 million vines over the next 12 months, which will result in some 2 million more bottles of English wine being made each year, according to data from industry body English Wine Producers.Also gaining popularity is French crémant sparkling wines. which have muscled in on the party circuit and are challenging the domination of the old favourite fizzes.In the first two months of the year Waitrose saw its crémant sales increase by 28 per cent on last year, peaking on Valentines Day as shoppers opted for it as an alternative to other bubbly.From chateaux to Roman aqueducts, French landmarks to be saved with funds from UK-style lottery \u0026#39heritage draw\u0026#39Cat lovers at Google are to blame for dwindling burrowing owl population, say wildlife activistsGender pay gap in medical field under government reviewBritish circus trainer fights to keep beloved elephant in her Spanish gardenGirl made false accusation of rape after her ex-boyfriend rejected herCatalonia independence fight spills onto the beaches of BarcelonaUK in \u0026#39crab crisis\u0026#39 as restaurants forced to pull dishes from menusRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedNicola Sturgeon: Theresa May has to concede that Britain must remain in a customs unionFamily of graduate killed on her birthday say \u0026#39light in our life is extinguished\u0026#39 Japan\u0026#39s 77,000 Buddhist temples to offer rooms to rent after law changeNew Zealand prepares to slaughter 15,000 cows in disease cull South Korean president may join Singapore summit as Donald Trump hails North\u0026#39s \u0026#39brilliant potential\u0026#39Israel sees an opportunity to drive a Iran out of Syria as Russia looks to its own interestsItaly\u0026#39s next government will take fight to Brussels and support Britain over Brexit, vows leading Five Star politicianYoung farmer breaks her arm in arm-wrestling matchMan arrested on suspicion of murdering woman and 11-year-old girlInside the luxury Canadian cabin that Meghan and Harry are rumoured to have chosen for their honeymoonAbortion clinic buffer zones set \u0026#39dangerous precedent\u0026#39 for freedom of speech, campaigners sayMurder inquiry launched after man killed in hit and runGirl Guides to learn how to be good with money with new \u0026#34saver badge\u0026#34We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/22/TELEMMGLPICT000164247270_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqF9BD_fYQB0teZOF4IslN2Ui6L4XAoX9KJ12arlP6KhI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"roman abramovich becomes israeli citizen month uk visa delayed","story":"The Russian oligarch, who is worth an estimated £8.6 billion, instantly became Israel’s wealthiest personRoman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, has become an Israeli citizen just a month after the UK delayed renewal of his British visa amid diplomatic tension between London and Moscow. Mr Abramovich, who is Jewish, exercised his right under Israel’s Law of Return, which states that Jews from anywhere in the world can become Israeli citizens. The Russian oligarch, who is worth an estimated £8.6 billion, instantly became Israel’s wealthiest person after receiving his citizenship on Monday. The 51-year-old had been travelling in and out of the UK for years on a Tier-1 investor visa, designed for wealthy foreigners who invest at least £2 million in Britain. He applied to renew the visa in April but did not immediately receive approval from the Home Office. It is not clear if the UK decided to reject his application permanently but a source familiar with the matter told the Daily  that the renewal process was taking an unusually long time. Mr Abramovich is believed to have returned to Russia after his visa expired and he did not attend Chelsea’s 1-0 victory over Manchester United in the FA Cup on May 20. Amber Rudd ordered a review of the visa status of wealthy Russians after the Salisbury nerve agent attackThe UK government has suggested it would take a harder line on Russian oligarchs in Britain following the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. The government has accused Russia of being behind the attack. It is not clear if there is a direct link between the UK’s moves on Russian oligarchs and Mr Abramovich’s visa. Mr Abramovich’s private G650 jet touched down in Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport on Monday and he was immediately granted Israeli citizenship. A spokesman for the Israeli interior ministry said he applied at the Israeli embassy in Moscow and was found eligible for citizenship after proving his Jewish heritage. “He filed a request to receive an immigration permit, his documents were checked according to the Law of Return, and he was indeed found eligible,” the spokesman told Israel’s Channel 10 news. Mr Abramovich previously purchased a £17.1 mansion in Tel Aviv’s upmarket Neve Tzedek neighbourhood. The house was a former hotel and Mr Abramovich bought it from the husband of Gal Gadot, the Israeli actress who starred in Wonderwoman. From chateaux to Roman aqueducts, French landmarks to be saved with funds from UK-style lottery \u0026#39heritage draw\u0026#39Cat lovers at Google are to blame for dwindling burrowing owl population, say wildlife activistsGender pay gap in medical field under government reviewBritish circus trainer fights to keep beloved elephant in her Spanish gardenGirl made false accusation of rape after her ex-boyfriend rejected herCatalonia independence fight spills onto the beaches of BarcelonaUK in \u0026#39crab crisis\u0026#39 as restaurants forced to pull dishes from menusProsecco no longer considered a luxury, experts sayNicola Sturgeon: Theresa May has to concede that Britain must remain in a customs unionFamily of graduate killed on her birthday say \u0026#39light in our life is extinguished\u0026#39 Japan\u0026#39s 77,000 Buddhist temples to offer rooms to rent after law changeNew Zealand prepares to slaughter 15,000 cows in disease cull South Korean president may join Singapore summit as Donald Trump hails North\u0026#39s \u0026#39brilliant potential\u0026#39Israel sees an opportunity to drive a Iran out of Syria as Russia looks to its own interestsItaly\u0026#39s next government will take fight to Brussels and support Britain over Brexit, vows leading Five Star politicianYoung farmer breaks her arm in arm-wrestling matchMan arrested on suspicion of murdering woman and 11-year-old girlInside the luxury Canadian cabin that Meghan and Harry are rumoured to have chosen for their honeymoonAbortion clinic buffer zones set \u0026#39dangerous precedent\u0026#39 for freedom of speech, campaigners sayMurder inquiry launched after man killed in hit and runGirl Guides to learn how to be good with money with new \u0026#34saver badge\u0026#34We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class= lazy   data-original= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/14/12/alan-rickman-8.jpg","title":"alan rickman snape harry potter letters frustrated auction collection","story":"‘I know, at times, you are frustrated but please know that you are an integral part of the films’Newly released letters from Alan Rickman’s personal collection have revealed the actor’s “frustrations” playing the character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter movies. One letter, written by producer David Heyman, thanks Rickman – who died in 2016 – for working on the second Harry Potter movie, The Chamber of Secrets. “Thank you for making HP2 a success.” the letter reads. “I know, at times, you are frustrated but please know that you are an integral part of the films.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We have still got to conclude the defence modernisation programme, but you would need to move north of 2.5 per cent to make any of this work, if you want to retain the same defence posture given the dangers, the complexities of the world that we face.”A study commissioned by Downing Street last year warned that all three branches of the military were “running to a standstill” as they struggle to recruit enough personnel to replace those leaving.The government’s decision to outsource army recruitment to contracting giant Capita has drawn fire, with a wider crisis blamed on a “flawed austerity drive” launched in 2012.The armed forces’ pay review body has already submitted its 2018 recommendations to the government, which are said to include a 3 per cent pay increase. A MoD spokesperson said the independent body’s findings were still being considered and an announcement would be made in due course.Military pay rises have been frozen or capped at 1 per cent a year since 2010 and while the government lifted the public sector pay cap in September, an announcement on the armed forces was delayed.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPeople play cricket in front of Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland.Chris Ashton of the Barbarians scores against England at Twickenham.

In other cases vulnerable asylum seekers have been released onto the streets with no accommodation. One immigration law firm saying they were dealing with the problem on a daily basis.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the it was “cruel and callous” for the Home Office to hold asylum seekers with a right to live in the community in “prison style” removal centres, while Labour MP David Lammy said it was wrong to treat “innocent people like criminals”. It comes amid mounting criticism of the UK’s immigration detention system, which currently holds around 26,500 people each year and around 2,500 at any given time. Recent figures obtained by The Independent revealed at least one person a day needs medical treatment for self-harming in detention, while the prisons watchdog described conditions in the centres as “prison-like”.The government is already under intense scrutiny following the Windrush scandal, which revealed that Caribbean nationals who had lived in the UK for decades were wrongly detained in removal centres. As many as 5,000 Commonwealth citizens in Britain have since been identified as potentially having been deprived of their immigration rights.In January, the government repealed a law that had enabled homeless detainees to apply for accommodation from within detention if they had nowhere to reside when released. This meant around 2,000 detainees who previously applied for this support each year are no longer able to, according to charities.A separate accommodation provision is available for asylum seekers and failed asylum seekers if they would be destitute without it. But lawyers and groups working with detainees said this was difficult to obtain from within detention because they would fail the “destitution test”.One male asylum seeker was granted bail in March after spending 10 months in detention, but his application for asylum accommodation was rejected by the Home Office on the grounds that he was “not destitute by the fact that he is being housed and his dietary needs are catered to”.The refusal letter stated: “Detention is based around shared facilities (bedrooms, shower rooms and dining rooms) which is not dissimilar to emergency accommodation with lack of liberty being the main difference.”At least one person a day is self-harming in UK detention centresThe man’s grant of bail lapsed and he remained in detention.In another case, a man who came to the UK in 2003 after fleeing torture in his home country was granted bail in March on the condition that an address for accommodation would be provided by the Home Office.But the next day he was released with no address, and has since been relying on charities, asylum seekers and several iniduals of good will for support with housing and food.Toufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis Solicitors, told The Independent his team was seeing the issue on a daily basis.“What we’re finding is that that Home Office is failing to provide accommodation in time. There are massive delays in them providing the accommodation, we’re talking months,” he said.“Immigration judges decide all the conditions are right for the person to be released and they direct the Home Office to provide accommodation. But then we’re seeing nothing.”Mr Hossain said that because the Home Office can’t be held in contempt of breaching a bail order, the department was often failing to act on providing accommodation unless the detainee issued unlawful detention proceedings.“If they’re fortunate enough to get a decent lawyer who will issue unlawful detention proceedings, they can get an order from the high court saying the Home Office must provide accommodation within a set period of time, and it does miraculously find accommodation,” he added.“They’re not prioritising it is because they’re immigrants, and it obviously costs money to provide accommodation.  In the meantime, people languish in detention at the cost to the taxpayer. The harm caused to people who have a legitimate right to be released is inexplicable.”Claire Sullivan, research and policy coordinator and charity Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID), said the vast majority of detainees the charity supports was no longer able to apply for accommodation support from the Home Office.Home Office keeping torture victims in detention, finds watchdog“As a consequence, many detainees are being indefinitely detained for no other reason than their lack of suitable accommodation. Others have been released by the Home Office to the streets, potentially into destitution,” she added.“As well as no application process, there is no appeal right for refusals to provide bail accommodation. Further, the Home Office does not provide reasons for refusals.”Jerome Phelps, director of charity Detention Action, accused the Home Officeof creating a “bureaucratic black hole” for people in detention.“People we work with are finding themselves detained in prison-like conditions indefinitely, with judges powerless to free them. Decisions by judges to order release become meaningless if the Home Office fails to provide the necessary address,” he said.“The lack of a time limit on detention makes it urgent that the department return to respecting the release decisions of the independent judiciary.”Responding to the findings, Ms Abbott said: “We have a legal and moral duty to treat refugees with fairness and humanity, but day after day we see just how cruel and callous the Tories’ hostile environment policy has become.“Detention centres with their prison-style security are not appropriate accommodation for asylum seekers that have been given the right to remain. This practice must end.”Mr Lammy echoed her view, saying: “It is totally wrong that the Home Office are holding asylum seekers in detention centres and treating innocent people like criminals.“The principle of habeas corpus is the founding principle of our legal system, and yet in 2018 the Home Office is unlawfully depriving people of their liberty. It is time for a review of the hostile environment policy that underpins this cruelty.”A Home Office spokesperson said it was aware of some cases of detainees waiting for accommodation to be allocated and that they were working closely with the accommodation providers, police and HM Prison and Probation Service to source suitable accommodation.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPeople play cricket in front of Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland.Chris Ashton of the Barbarians scores against England at Twickenham.

Though expensive enough for single people, couples and families living abroad can easily find themselves spending many thousands of pounds on a citizenship application once the UK’s charges for leaving are taken into account. The department says the sharp increase reflects an increased cost of handling applications – at the same time as British people applying for foreign passports surged.Figures from EU statistics agency Eurostat show the number of British people seeking the citizenship of other countries had increased by 165 per cent in the year of the referendum compared with the previous year. Inidual figures from other countries show a sustained increase in similar applications throughout 2017.Renouncing nationality is a last resort for people whose livelihood is in danger and an extremely painful decision to makeMichael Harris, British in EuropeThe increase was sharpest for some countries that ban dual citizenship: the number of British people adopting Dutch passports increased from 166 British citizens in 2015 to 636 in the year of the referendum, a 283 per cent increase. Though the Dutch government is changing the law to allow Dutch citizens living in Britain to adopt dual citizenship – to cushion them from the referendum result – no such exemption has been made for British citizens living in the Netherlands.Campaigners said the move to hike the fees had added to the “painful” decision many British people had taken to renounce their nationality, which most only did because they feel they have no other option to secure their future.“The increase will just add to the difficulties people face in countries like the Netherlands which do not allow dual nationality,” said Michael Harris, a Briton living abroad and a member of the British in Europe steering committee.“Renouncing nationality is a last resort for people whose livelihood is in danger and an extremely painful decision to make.”Countdown to Brexit: what is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?The UK embassy of Poland, which also bans dual nationality, said following the referendum there had been a massive rise in British people enquiring about getting a Polish passport, with about 1,000 in the space of two weeks. The embassy said it previously had around 10 such enquiries each month.Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: “This is the Conservative Brexit government and the Home Office giving Brits in the EU the last kick out the door. Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

There was no warning and the fence just appeared.It is 2ft from our front window and front door. It\u0027s like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.Exasperated Mr Entwistle and his wife, who married in July last year, say they would not have even considered buying the property if they had known the trouble in store for them.SWNSThe view across farmland that the Entwistles had enjoyed before the 6ft high fence was put upMr Entwistle said: We\u0027re not even sure we want to live here now.Even if the fence gets taken down there is no guarantee it won\u0027t come back later or even be extended around the back.We are in fear of that.The couple, who had moved from rented accommodation, are now considering contacting a solicitor.Mr Entwistle said: At first I was tearful but now I am angry.We specifically bought this house, beating off a lot of competition, for its beautiful views and now they\u0027ve gone.Geri Halliwell on Honeymoon with her new husband Christian Horner in Cannes                    EPS1 of 44Geri Halliwell on honeymoon with her new husband Christian HornerWe now keep the curtains closed in the front room and spend most of our time upstairs.Rebekah is too upset to be in the living room.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408650365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apply here for our first summer internship scheme to work for the the number one paper","story":"The internships, for 18 to 25-year-olds, are available in roles including reporting, news-gathering, design and production, across print and online.Placements will last up to 12 weeks and be based mainly in London.

We are Europe’s main security power. They have much to lose.Theresa May is demanding back the £1billion we put into this system.But that is chicken feed next to our £39billion divorce bill.She must insist not a penny is paid until we are reinstated in Galileo and a trade deal is signed.We were naive to imagine Brussels would be a friendly partner after Brexit.Its powerful bureaucrats are now nakedly and dangerously hostile.WOULD you pay £2,000 extra tax a year to keep the NHS afloat? How about more when, inevitably, that isn’t enough?The sums needed are astronomical.The Government is set to put in £350million extra a week.But that merely keeps it going as demand soars.Any improvement will need far more — and the NHS is already asking for it.Experts say the annual budget must soar by £56BILLION within 15 years, or 9p on income tax.No sensible Government will raise that, nor should it.On its 70th birthday, Theresa May should announce a Royal Commission, and let the brightest health experts and politicians agree on a new NHS model we can afford.WE back day-release prisoners getting jobs . . . under strict conditions.Here’s why. Our jails are violent, drug-infested cesspits breeding hopelessness.Lags emerge with no prospects into unemployment, then drift back into crime in a dismal cycle costing billions.What a difference, though, when a store chain like Timpson takes a chance on ex-cons and gives them a new start.But Justice Secretary David Gauke MUST ensure watertight vetting.If just one sex predator or thug reoffends on day release, the idea will fall apart.HOW come vast numbers of migrants still flock to a Britain which supposedly became racist overnight on June 23, 2016?Did the 200,000 net new arrivals last year not get the Remoaners’ memo?Or is the reality different?Yes, Britain voted to control its borders, like any nation beyond the EU.But we are still the most welcoming country on Earth.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And for good.The free-trading “global Britain” Mrs May has repeatedly made central to her vision of our future will be dead.Her entire Department for International Trade will be redundant.Incredibly, we would be inviting Brussels to run the trade policy of the world’s fifth biggest economy forever — even after we have supposedly “left” the EU.And we would have NO say in it.This is not the minor detail Remainers want you to believe. It is a giant, decisive leap towards the destruction of Brexit and 17million referendum votes.It would be a mortal blow to the Prime Minister. How could she survive it?Tory rebels must realise this. But even wrecking their PM, Government and party, jeopardising national stability and potentially handing power to Corbyn’s Marxist lunatics fails to deter them.Mrs May must leave them in no doubt about the monstrous risk they are taking.Then, for the first time, she must turn that aggression on Brussels.The Sun is heartily sick of the EU’s destructive belligerence and playground bullying, sick of it “teaching Britain a lesson”, sick of our timid, cowed Government cravenly turning the other cheek.We’ve had two years of it.

Like it denies poisoning the Skripals, backing Assad’s chemical weapons massacres and meddling in other countries’ ­elections. But the world must act.Many countries have sent Putin’s spies home. It’s a start. But it’s not enough.Russia, as Boris Johnson rightly says, has a “disregard for innocent life” and “believes it can act with impunity”.And no wonder, when the cream of world football is about to help it showcase its hospitality for a month.It is shameful Russia was never stripped of the World Cup.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Members money should go towards protecting jobs, working conditions and wages.And Unite member Tom Wade blasted: Len McCluskey wastes £35,000 of Unite members subs on JezFest because its a self-glorifying piece of tosh for Corbyn that no-one wants to go to.The festival at White Hart Lane recreation ground will feature speeches by leftie politicians and activists including Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell.Musical acts featuring include the Magic Numbers, Rae Morris and Reverend and the Makers.Tickets are £35 each - or £30 for the unemployed and low-paid.Top Tories have mocked the bungled festival - Cabinet minister Esther McVey joked: Would you really trust this party with the country’s finances when they can’t even organise a JezFest in a field?And senior MP Sarah Wollaston, pointing to the presence of a band called Hookworms, added: Probably as much fun as actually catching a parasitic nematode worm, which even appears to be on the billing."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jh-image-p10-kavanagh-cartoon.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may is walking into an eu trap to derail brexit and betray leave voters","story":"On closer inspection we discover she has merely won time to impale herself more deeply on the EU hook.The PM is likely to repeat this performance at next month’s crunch EU summit, where final decisions over Britain’s future relationship with Europe will be signed.Mrs May will be offered brightly wrapped “concessions” which appear to honour her “Brexit means Brexit” promise.Unwrapped, they will reveal Brexit actually means Remain.Abrasive Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings warned last week: “It’s a train wreck. The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am everything and nothing. This has big advantages. Every day is different.”He describes himself as being in a “domestic partnership” since January 2015.A PayPal account he advertises on social media where he urges people to “send money to Jesus” currently stands at zero.A spokesman added that any complaint would normally be lodged with a local court who would then send officials to notify squatters they must leave.A source said: In most cases the court officials go alone. They usually don’t call for police back-up.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409381089.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"wh smiths uk worst high street shop 2018","story":"The chain has been ranked in the bottom two for the eighth consecutive year, with critics slamming its poor customer service, bad value for money and generally dire state of its stores.The annual survey by consumer champion Which? comes after the retailer was slammed for selling £1 toothpaste for £8 in its hospital outlets.One customer told Which?: “I find WH Smith very expensive and its stores need updating.”Another said: “I always use the self-service tills because the staff are rude.”Another shopper summed up the retailer’s troubles, branding it “hugely inferior to what it was in the past”.Which? asked more than 10,000 shoppers about their shopping experience at 100 major retailers.The customer scores given are based on customers’ experiences of purchasing non-grocery items, their satisfaction levels and the likelihood of recommending each shop.Lush, Savers and Smyths Toys have been named the highest ranking shops a huge leap for three retailers that didn’t even manage last year’s top 10.Customers praised the smells of Lush stores, the prices at discount cosmetics store Savers, and the “friendly and cheerful” staff at Smyths Toys.Last year’s top two, Toolstation and Richer Sounds are now in fourth and sixth place, respectively.Despite only dropping by two percentage points, John Lewis, which finished joint third in 2017, falls to 10th place - its worst ranking since the annual survey launched in 2010.But the department store’s strength as an all-rounder was still evident, as it snatched the top spot in four categories - appliances and electronics, furniture and home, outdoor and sports and wellbeing and beauty.Price proved to be a deciding factor for many consumers - particularly when it came to everyday essentials - pushing stores like Savers up the rankings.Which? saw a similar trend in its recent supermarket survey, which this year saw Aldi overtake Waitrose for the first time in three years, proving that customers are sometimes willing to sacrifice their overall shopping experience if it means getting better value for money.Clintons- 60%Evans - 63%= Sport Direct - 63%Homebase/Bunnings - 64%JD Sports - 65%= Toys R Us/Babies R Us - 65%Dorothy Perkins/Burton - 66%= Halfords (inc Cycle Republic) - 66%= Miss Selfridge - 66%= Ryman- 66%Lush - 81%= Savers - 81%= Smyths Toys - 81%Screwfix - 80%= Toolstation - 80%Bodycare - 79%= Richer Sounds - 79%The Perfume Shop - 78%= Waterstones - 78%The Body Shop - 77%= Dunhelm 77%= Ikea 77%= John Lewis 77%Describing their bugbears of shopping in store, shoppers said they are put off by crowds (49%), queueing (49%) as well as the behaviour of other shoppers (38%).While some high street retailers are thinking up new ways to entice customers into their stores, others are struggling.

They are just terrible.Ben Clissitt, Which?

Because it could not.No amount of, Be careful - we could still walk out, you know, sabre-rattling makes the slightest odds when the other side knows that the day after doing so, we would be back pleading for continuity and for the ongoing delivery of, and access to, functions the British state has no capability to provide.And Dom Cummings, who ran the Vote Leave campaign, wrote last week: Downing Street, the Treasury, the Cabinet Office and the Cabinet have made no such preparations and there is no intention of starting.Chancellor Philip Hammond has come under fire for failing to provide enough funding for a no deal scenario.Last year, he set aside £3billion to fund Britains preparation for leaving the EU.The Sun revealed last week that ministers are making plans to turn 13 miles of the M20 into a lorry park if customs checks are imposed at Dover.A Downing Street spokesman said: The Prime Minister is committed to getting the best possible Brexit deal, one that works for the UK and the EU.The Government is committing extensive resources as part of our preparations for leaving the EU - whether in the event of a deal or not, and at the autumn Budget the chancellor allocated £3billion specifically for our exit preparations.The Foreign Secretary - who has just returned from a trip to South America - said quitting the EU will allow us to build stronger links with other countries.And he said our EU membership had weakened ties with countries such as Argentina, Chile and Peru.Boris wrote in the Daily : Now is our moment not to be less European - we can do a great free trade deal with the EU that will benefit both sides - but to be truly global again.Now is the time to create deals with these dynamic countries.He added: For Latin America and for Britain there are realms of gold on either side of the Atlantic.

The same was seen in our case.Though the patient reported accidental insertion of the shower head and denied voluntary insertion, there is a high suspicion of voluntary insertion for auto-erotic purpose.It is not the first time a foreign object has had to be removed from a rectum.In fact, its surprisingly common.A large variety of objects have been reported, including bottles, cans, glass bulbs, stones, small rods, fruits and vegetables, vibrators, dildos and toys, Dr Kumar added.Insertion of objects for auto-erotic purposes is the most common cause of rectal foreign bodies.Other common causes include accidents and assaults. The presentation is often delayed, and history is often improper.Two-thirds of the patients are males in their 30s or 40s, who use such objects for auto-erotic purposes.Last year a man perforated his bowel after he lost control of a 30in bendy sex toy after a boozy night.The 53-year-old man presented to A\u0026ampE complained of severe lower abdomen pain and admitted he had inserted a non-battery operated sex toy into his rectum.Doctors noted that the sex toy had been inserted into the rectum when the man was under heavy alcohol influence which led to a loss of control."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409368888.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"facebook marketplace man takes ford fiesta without paying","story":"George Wood, 21, had advertised his silver Ford Fiesta on Facebook Marketplace when he handed over the keys to a “toothless” man - who promised to pay for it later.But George was left around £300 out of pocket when the buyer failed to transfer the money into his bank account.When the money failed to materialise he sent a flurry of texts to the culprit who responded: “You won’t be getting your money but you will be getting a punch in the mouth”.After Kent Police said there was nothing he could do, because he had willingly handed over the keys, George from Ashford, Kent posted an appeal on Facebook to try to find his motor.The alleged thief then sent George a picture of his 16-year-old car at a scrap yard - being crushed by a giant metal claw.George said: I was a bit of an idiot.

Only half? Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”.

Your garden or local park can host just as much fun and help you keep costs down too. The trick is keeping everyone busy so the laughter flows and you all finish the weekend happy and re-energised. \u2028We’ve teamed up with Halfords to share some exciting ideas for what you can get up to – without breaking the bank. Get out into the garden  The key for any bank holiday weekend or half term is going to be fending off the inevitable boredom that can grip children – so why not put them in charge? They get to set the agenda, arrange the football tournament and decide if there\u0027s a water fight or not (there will be, so hide the garden hosepipe if you want to stay dry). To help them run the show, get them to help put up a tent to base themselves in.  The Secret Garden kids play tent and Rocket kids play tent are both ideal for getting their imaginations going. You\u0027ll also want to get the little’uns something to sit on, as they lay down the law of the garden. There’s even a Rocket folding kids chair and Secret Garden folding kids chair to match their tents.  Tents and a whole range of other camping gear are half price at Halfords for the bank holiday. Set up a grown-up place to chill  If the sun shows up for the weekend then you\u0027ll want to be able to find some cooling shade. \u2028While the kids are putting up their play tents, the adults can be busy erecting a sanctuary of their own – or kicking back in a Urban Escape King Size Moonchair, above. \u2028Take a look at the Halfords Gazebo with two side panels. Offering a UV rating of 50+ means not only will it offer shade, but it will also help keep you protected from the sun. \u2028\u2028  And if it rains? Don\u0027t worry, the gazebo is waterproof too. \u2028\u2028 A range of gazebos currently have 20% off at Halfords – check them out here.  Pack up a picnic lunch using a Halfords 40 litre coolbox – you can connect it to the mains or keep it charged in your car until you\u0027re ready, and then it will keep your food and drink nice and cool. It has wheels too, so no need to worry about getting it to your destination. And right now there’s 20 per cent off. You\u0027ll need cutlery, plates and something to drink out of too. The good news is Halfords has a four-piece set of acrylic wine glasses (it\u0027s your holiday too!) for just \u0026pound5. Rainbow plates and cutlery are also half price too, so grab the full set and make your park picnic bright and summery. Scoot to the park \u2028The kids can scoot on the Mongoose Stance Stunt Scooter, which is great for all wannabe daredevils. It\u0027s also down to just \u0026pound45 (save \u0026pound18), for the holiday weekend.  Or they can jump on the Slipstream Go Kart, a safe, fast and fun steel-frame go kart featuring wide pneumatic tyres for stability and a handbrake.

David Olusoga said repatriating the objects help our relationship with the Commonwealth after Brexit .  Mr Olusoga, who came to the UK from Nigeria as a child, said he believed the Benin Bronzes should be given back to the country of his heritage after they were seized in ‘violent raids’ in the late 19th century. The historian, who presents the BBC Civilisations series, has called for the Elgin Marbles, one of the most high profile and contentious cases, should be returned to Greece.  He told the audience at the Hay literary festival that a friend of his had come up with a solution: “He said we should have a special version of Supermarket Sweep where every country is given a huge shopping trolley and two minutes in the British Museum. Maybe he’s right, maybe that’s the way forward.” He said there were around 4,000 objects taken from the Nigerian palace that were national treasures including the Benin bronzes.  “I think it’s a very, very clear case of appropriation and theft,” he said. “They were taken in 1897 during the raid on the Palace of Benin. The palace was destroyed they were taken and then sold to pay for the cost of the military adventure. Everyone was open about this – steal this stuff, send it to pay for the cost of the bullets. It’s just such a stark case of theft.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eight job osborne former chancellor","story":"NewsEight job Osborne!

But 60 years on those once-young men who were ordered to watch the test firing of Britain\u0027s deadliest weapon are victims of a different horror: official denial. At war pension hearings, Supreme Court appeals and over petitions and pleas, successive British governments have told our nuclear test veterans that what they did was nothing special. They were not irradiated, they cannot prove it, they have no claim.  There is evidence aplenty of what happened to those men. A University of Dundee study found a third of the veterans died before 1999, most in their 50s and from the sort of cancers that, were they at an American bomb test, would have got them a war pension.    To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .    Their wives report 3 times the normal rate of miscarriages. Their children have 10 times the normal amount of birth defects - such as missing and extra teeth, spine and skull deformities, heart and eye problems. Another study found double the rate of blood cancers that the government had admitted another found higher rates of leukaemia, Down\u0027s syndrome and infant mortality.  And we know the Grapple Y blast alone, on April 28, 1958, was 100 times more powerful than the bombs which levelled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Imagine how it feels to be that veteran, and told that your family\u0027s suffering is still not proof.  The British government has always insisted on a scientific link between the radiation and the veterans\u0027 claimed health issues. That sounds reasonable, until you realise that the science which could establish the truth simply hasn\u0027t been invented yet - and by the time that it is, the veterans will all be long gone.  Of the 22,000 who were sent to Maralinga in Australia, Malden Island and Christmas Island in the south Pacific, and to US tests in Nevada, just 1,500 are still alive. A small and shrinking cohort who are still fighting a long-forgotten war.  But they have 155,000 descendants. You might even be one without knowing it, if there are estrangements or remarriages within your family. And scientists do agree on something - that radiation causes genetic mutation, that these mutations can last for 20 generations or 500 years, and that there is no way of knowing who will be affected.   To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .   Radiation causes random changes in the DNA. It may be pancreatic cancer, a thyroid dysfunction, or your sperm is rendered useless. It could be your children have blue eyes rather than green. A 2007 study on New Zealand veterans at British bomb tests found they had the same rate of genetic damage as survivors of the Chernobyl blast. The UK government would have you believe this is coincidence.  We need only common sense to realise that what links these men and their families to those of Chernobyl is the release of deadly, damaging material. Perhaps they were not all irradiated - perhaps they were harmed by the DDT sprayed over the island most days, or the toxic heavy metals that rain out of nuclear explosions like beryllium, or something else that was unique to the nuclear tests we conducted on two Pacific islands and two separate continents. The British government claims the bombs were safe. If that was so, why did we build a massive military base in the middle of the South Pacific in order to explode them?   To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .   If that was so, why didn\u0027t we save a lot of time and expense and test those bombs in Southampton? And if that was so, of what use could non-harmful, totally safe bombs possibly be to our military?  The answer, of course, is that it wasn\u0027t safe. We wouldn\u0027t do it today. And if we ever were to fire another nuclear weapon, you can be damned sure that we wouldn\u0027t do it with 22,000 of our own servicemen stood underneath it dressed in nothing but cotton shorts.   They did not know the risks. Many were on National Service with no choice about being there. The risks they took are now perfectly clear.  On Christmas Island a few weeks ago four of the veterans returned to dedicate a new memorial built by the impoverished islanders. They were feted by local politicians, given all respect, and invited to parade the standard of the British Nuclear Test Veterans\u0027 Association.  That is more honour than they have ever received in their own country. Here, they are told to apply for a war pension, and that to get one they\u0027ll need proof of their radiation dose, when such proof is either held by the government, never existed, or has long since been lost. So 90% of all their pension applications are rejected.  Here, \u0026pound17m of taxpayer\u0027s money has been spent fighting court claims for compensation. Here, the government admits irradiating civilians but not service personnel. Here, if they want a medal they have to buy an unofficial, unrecognised one - and it\u0027s \u0026pound45.

Yvonne Mason, from Atlanta, said the letter was so poorly written it would have barely scrapped a pass in her class. “If it had been written in middle school, I’d give it a C or C-plus. If it had been written in high school, I’d give it a D,” Ms Mason told South Carolina’s Greenville News. I have never, ever, received a letter with this many silly mistakes, she said.  The numerous errors included 11 examples of incorrect capitalisation of words such as “president” and “state”. Ms Mason, who had written to the Donald Trump about the Valentine\u0027s Day school shooting in Florisa which left 17 dead, was stylistically appalling. This included 11 examples of incorrect capitalisation of words such as “president” and “state”. Although she admitted it was probably written by a member of staff rather than the president, Ms Mason said she was surprised that it was so poorly written. “When you get letters from the highest level of government, you expect them to be at least mechanically correct,” she said. So she decided to dig out her favourite purple pen, as red is considered too harsh by some teachers in the US, make some corrections and return the letter. But Ms Mason wasn\u0027t just disappointed by the calibre of the writing but also the letter\u0027s content.  She said Mr Trump had completely failed to address her concerns. In the letter she sent the former teacher urged Mr Trump to individually meet with the families who lost loved ones at the Stoneman Douglas High School massacre.

Madeline Dye has never been on a date and her first - and only - visit to a pub came on her 90th birthday. But she reckons her extraordinary longevity is down to avoiding the stresses that come with marriage and relationships.  Madeline was born in Heeley, South Yorkshire, in 1912 - the same year the Titanic sank and the Woolwich foot tunnel opened.  The retired bookbinder lived independently at home until the age of 103 when a fall left her needing nursing care. At home, she cooked steak and chips in dipping and kept herself busy around the house - even putting up her own curtains in her later years.  Despite moving to Norton Lees Hall care home, Madeline still walks without a stick and can often be found chatting with other residents. She celebrated her 106th birthday on April 28 with a family trip to Baslow, Derbyshire and a party at the care home. Her niece Diana Heaton, 80, said: She walks freely without a stick and is very independent. When she was 103 she asked if I could change some curtains for her in a bedroom. I said I would do it the next day and when I arrived she said \u0027do you like the curtains - look what I\u0027ve done?\u0027 She changed them and carried some steps from the cellar up the stairs to her front bedroom. She does still dress herself and goes into the common room and chats with people. She has a great sense of humour still, she has never lost it. Whenever anyone asks her about her past romances or if she has a husband, she says \u0027I\u0027ve never had one, that\u0027s why I\u0027m this age\u0027. She says she has not had the stresses of marriage, it\u0027s tongue-in-cheek more than anything. She has always loved her clothes and has always dressed immaculately.

Logan Johns-Evans was rushed to hospital after his mum Jade Johns found him unresponsive when she went to wake him up for school. She said the youngster had smoked a rolled-up cigarette but he had no idea the synthetic drug Spice was put in it as a joke.  Ms Johns told Wales Online that her son reacted as though a “monster had taken over his body” - and she\u0027s shared shocking photos showing him unconscious in his hospital bed.   The mum, from Wildmill, South Wales, said the drug could not be tested for in her son\u0027s urine or blood, but doctors checked his symptoms and made a clinical decision that he was suffering from the effects of Spice. The drug can cause fast heart rate, vomiting, confusion and violent behaviour, although many users are often pictured slumped over in town or city centres looking like zombies. Ms Johns said she and her family were beside themselves with worry as her son lay unresponsive in a bed at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.  Ms Johns said: “He woke up at 3am and I thought he was sleepwalking because he was trying to make his way out the door and he was making no sense. “I put him back to bed and at 6.40am I went to wake him up for school and he couldn’t speak or stand so we whisked him to hospital. “He was in resus on high dependency. He was like a zombie. A monster had taken over his body and he had so much strength it was unreal.  “It was scary because he couldn’t speak and there was nothing in him. There was no response to his eyes or the light in his pupils, the only way you could describe it was like a zombie because nothing was making sense. “In hospital he became angry and he had so much strength but the doctors said he didn’t know what was going on. It wasn’t an 11-year-old child inside that body. “My daughter told me he had been smoking and someone came forward to say someone had put Spice in his rolly as a joke.” Around 33 hours after arriving at hospital, Logan came around and became his normal self but he had no memory of what had happened and believed he had only just arrived at hospital.

Tommy Cowan collapsed while at Mutiny Festival in Portsmouth on Saturday, with one horrified witness revealing she saw \u0027blood coming out his mouth\u0027. Mr Cowan, a road maintenance worker, and a second festival-goer, Georgia Jones, 18, were both rushed to hospital after reports of a \u0027high strength or bad batch\u0027 of drugs at the event. The pair, who fell ill 20 minutes apart from each other, were both tragically pronounced dead, while a third person remains in a critical condition in hospital.  Speaking from his home in Havant, Mr Cowan\u0027s father Damian, 43, paid tribute to his son, but claimed he had not been contacted by anyone responsible for organising the festival. He said: [Tommy] meant everything to me, he was my boy. He was funny, he loved life and he loved his little boy. He was everything. He was a good lad - unfortunately he made a bad choice. Delivery driver Mr Cowan added: He was a brilliant dad, he went to work all week, he would buy his son all the best stuff. He was just brilliant, he really was, he was so loving.  He said that he was frustrated with organisers at the festival, which was headlined by Dizzee Rascal on the night of the tragedy. Organisers, who cancelled acts on Sunday following the incident, said that they had 175 security and crowd managers working on the site. Mr Cowan said: I\u0027m frustrated that the organisers of the festival - no one has contacted me to say \u0027I\u0027m sorry\u0027. You\u0027d expect them to do that. I\u0027m just going to miss him, I really am. A friend of Tommy\u0027s, Jack Ford, 19, who studied at college with him, said: He was always happy. He\u0027d be the first one of the group to always be there for us.  In a statement, festival organiser Luke Betts said the deaths were \u0027deeply upsetting\u0027, adding: We again wish to send all our thoughts to the families. Hampshire police said the deaths were being treated as separate incidents, and that they were \u0027making enquiries into the circumstances surrounding those deaths effectively on behalf of the coroner\u0027. Police had pledged a crackdown on illegal substances at the event two days before it started. But just hours before the two died, festival organisers had warned of a \u0027bad batch\u0027 of a substance circulating at the festival.  Three arrests were made overnight on Sunday in relation to drugs being supplied at the festival. Two 20-year-old men, from Havant and Waterlooville, and a 22-year-old Cosham man have been arrested and on Monday were in police custody. Organisers said around 30,000 people were due to attend the festival, which was cut short as a \u0027safety precaution\u0027 after the deaths. A third person remains in critical condition in hospital today, with 15 people admitted after the first day of the festival. However, a spokeswoman for Queen Alexandra Hospital, in Portsmouth, said not all of the admissions were drugs-related.

But it seems that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have been making plans for a romantic break in one of the most spectacular places on Earth. The newly-wed pair are believed to be headed for the Canadian Rockies, specifically Jasper National Park in the heart of the province of Alberta. According to TMZ, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be staying in a secluded log cabin at Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge, a sprawling resort set in pristine wilderness.  Their home-from-home will be the 6,000sqft Outlook Cabin dubbed The Royal Retreat as it has hosted a number of other royal guests including the current Queen and Prince Philip in 2005 and her parents in 1939.  Jasper Park Lodge is set on the shores of Lac Beauvert and has a vast golf course which has been rated the best in Canada. The couple are likely to be protected by Canadian and British security. Sources told TMZ that the 700-acre resort had ordered in specialist gear it normally does not keep on site.  Jasper is a UNESCO World Heritage site reknown for its abundant wildlife including grizzly, black bears, mountain caribou, elk, moose and wolves.   Details emerged about their honeymoon after more information came out about Prince William\u0027s speech. One of the guests told the Sunday Times the second in line to the throne made a filthy joke about wet knickers. Unfortunately details of the joke haven\u0027t been leaked - but we really hope we find out at some point! William also pulled a prank on his little brother at the party, and nearly floored some of the guests in the process.  Apparently Harry recently fell off a ladder while trying to change a lightbulb, so Wills tied a ladder to the back of the newlyweds\u0027 car. Harry\u0027s pal Charlie van Straubenzee also spoke, mocking the prince for his ginger hair. According to the Times, he questioned Harry\u0027s behaviour when he was acting as dorm monitor at Ludgrove School in Berkshire, where they were both students. He said: All I wanted was a cuddle from my mummy. Instead Harry nicked my teddy bear and chucked it out on to the roof. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you, how can you put someone in charge of a dorm when that someone is worse behaved than the whole dorm combined?  The bride and groom also made speeches during the evening reception at Frogmore House in Windsor Castle. Harry reportedly moved guests to tears as he gushed over his new wife and paid tribute to her mum Doria. Meghan read an emotional love poem and declared she had finally found her prince.

Kate, 24, destroyed the giant bone-in ribeye steak with glee - despite it being large enough to feed a family of six. The petite food blogger said: It was literally the same size as my face. This was the biggest steak I had ever seen.  I honestly thought I\u0027d have had no chance finishing it. When I picked it up on the board, it was about the same weight as a brick. But once I took the first bite, my fears went away - it was so juicy and tender. Before the challenge, I had been worried that I would get bored of the taste, so I asked for lots of different sauces. The flavour of the beef was so exquisite that it didn\u0027t need anything at all.  If I\u0027m being honest with myself, I was a bit disappointed when it was over. I\u0027d gladly do it again. The steak weighed more than 2.2kg, which is more than half the weight of a standard house brick - or the equivalent to a medium pumpkin. Kate is no stranger to big portions, but what made this eating feat even more impressive is that it was the first time she had ever taken on a steak challenge. She said: Up until quite recently, I was really not that bothered about steak - but I\u0027m definitely a big fan now  The 5ft 5ins blogger polished off the biggest steak served at M restaurant in Bank, central London, a bone-in ribeye more than four inches thick. She was asked to try to eat huge hunk of beef, which sells for a whopping \u0026pound240, to celebrate the eatery\u0027s chef\u0027s table at Chestertons Polo in the Park next month. Kate, who lives in Kennington, south London, said: I guess they got me involved because I can eat like a horse. I\u0027m not complaining through, it was an absolute pleasure from start to finish. Chestertons Polo in the Park asked me to eat the steak because I\u0027ve got a reputation for being as hungry as a horse - and it\u0027s true.

The brazen Gosport MP and junior Health Minister is proving an enemy rather than an ally as cooks and cleaners at military bases on \u0026shyPortsmouth Harbour fight a contractor’s dirty tricks. This column last October revealed the plucky Fort Blockhouse group’s brave if unequal fight against ESS, part of Compass Group with a Fat Cat \u0026pound5.8m boss, after the corporate bloodsuckers unilaterally decided to stop paying them for two weeks of the year. I regret to report deadbeat Dinenage fobbed off the women when they asked for help, doing the bare minimum as far as I can see in writing to junior Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood then forwarding his worthless reply to a union official without the courtesy of a covering letter. Acknowledging “strength of feeling”, Ellwood added offence to \u0026pound500 injury – two weeks’ pay – by hiding behind MoD contracts, deals granting bad employers green lights to short-change loyal staff. Unite regional officer Bob Middleton’s judgement that the Tory pair “washed their hands” of indefensible abuse is bang on the money.  Gosport is a small piece of a large jigsaw as exploitation at work spreads rapidly and proliferating zero hours contracts become an increasing curse. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady says she’s met Germany’s powerhouse Angela Merkel more often in the last two years than she has Theresa May. A Tory PM who sees CBI business chiefs monthly, but grants a sole audience to the champion of six million workers, betrays the anti-grafter mentality of Conservativism. May, Dinenage, Ellwood and too many of their Tory colleagues instinctively identify with the boss not the bossed, the exploiter not the exploited. Weakening trade unions and stripping employment protection under the cover of cutting red tape when the gig economy’s falsely \u0026shyself-employed cabbies and couriers suffer as much or more as the employed, is what drives these Tories as it did the old.

Samantha Markle, who shares a father with the newlywed 36-year-old, has been scathing of her estranged relative on social media and in the press. In her most recent outburst she has slammed the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s coat of arms and said it “looks like it was drawn by someone in a kindergarten classroom”. Samantha Markle, who has not spoken to Meghan since 2015, said the design of the arms was “silly” because neither the UN, women’s rights nor “anything of substance” is represented.  Kensington Palace said on Friday when the image was released that Meghan had worked closely with the College of Arms throughout the design process. Ms Markle said: “Quills for communication? “She does not communicate with people she cuts people out of her life including a best friend of 30 years and two speeches in her whole life time does not make her a public speaker. “Her degrees are in drama and foreign affairs and only a bachelor degree.” She went on: “Her motto is say nothing and she cut everyone off.” “It just seems like the coat of arms was thrown together he’s [sic] silly because neither the UN, nor women’s rights, nor anything of substance.. but especially our dad and even her mom are not represented there.  It is an empty coat of arms so it makes no sense.”  She added: “Our father should be named on the coat of arms and for the Royals to deprive him of that is classless.” Earlier, she had written: “Extremely improper that my father was not named on the coat of arms and quite frankly looks like it was drawn by someone in a kindergarten classroom.” Thomas Markle Snr, 73, is not being granted a coat of arms in a break with royal family tradition. The Duchess of Sussex worked closely with the royal College of Arms throughout the design process, with each aspect of the image holding personal meaning for her. The blue background of the shield represents the Pacific Ocean off the California coast, while the two golden rays across the shield are symbolic of the sunshine of The Duchess\u0027s home state. The three quills represent communication and the power of words.

Megan Kenway-Head, 23, was wedged in the play equipment for over an hour as she awkwardly waited for firefighters to arrive after attempts by her partner and strangers to free her failed. The Southampton mum-of-two said the family were enjoying a day out over the bank holiday weekend when she decided to take her children to the park. She said: When we got there the children weren’t really interested in being there, so I decided to get them in the mood and climbed into a swing. They found it entertaining and sat in the ones next to me and we all started swinging.  Megan admitted it was not the first time in her parenting life she had been on a child\u0027s swing. She said: When I went to get out I realised I was stuck. The kids started laughing.”  Her partner Jordan Sanders, 24, tried to lift Megan out, and even called on a stranger to help. Megan said: Two fully grown men tried to help me shuffle my body out but I didn\u0027t budge. They even turned me upside down but when that failed, we finally decided it was probably a good idea to call for help. The day definitely took a funny turn. The couple called the local fire service and soon after officers from Hightown Fire Station arrived at the scene.  Jordan, who filmed the incident, can be heard laughing as he asks Megan how she feels: Embarrassed, very embarrassed. I just did not think this would ever happen to me. The firemen placed a foot stall underneath Megan\u0027s feet so she was able to hoist her body out of the swing. She said: When they turned up and saw me stuck they found it amusing. While they were working out how to free me one of them joked about amputating one of my legs.

The men have known each other since prep school, the private education equivalent to primary school, and Charlie said he was very proud of the way his friend handled the tragedy aged just 12 years old.   A guest told the Sunday Times : He described how awful it had been for Harry to go through everything and how proud all Harry’s friends are of how he has come through it.  He told Harry how happy his mother would have been that he has found love with Meghan and how excited she would be to see them starting their lives together as a married couple. Harry was pretty emotional at that point. The guest said he also praised Meghan for making Harry so happy since they started dating.  But he wasn\u0027t so kind to his pal in the rest of the speech, and he teased him for his ginger hair. He also questioned Harry\u0027s behaviour when he was dormitory monitor when they were at Ludgrove School in Berkshire, accusing him of throwing his teddy bear on the roof.   Best man Prince William also teased his little brother during his speech and also told a filthy joke about wet knickers .

The laid-back family outing couldn\u0027t be more different to last weekend, when they took centre stage at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s royal wedding. Princess Charlotte looked adorable in a red summer dress with pink trainers and seemed to be enjoying a tasty ice cream cone.

Prince George also had the chance to have a look inside a fire truck during their day out.

Police are investigating after Georgia Jones, 18, and 20-year-old Tommy Cowan - aka Tommy Bakeer - were both rushed to hospital after falling ill just 20 minutes apart at Mutiny Festival but sadly died. There are claims tonight that people were taken ill at the festival after taking so-called \u0027Green Heineken\u0027 MDMA tablets.  A total of 15 people at the dance music festival were taken to hospital, with one still in critical condition and organisers cancelled the festival today over safety concerns. Just hours after Georgia’s death, her heartbroken mother posted a tribute to her daughter who was “full of life” and urged other drug users to learn from her death. She said her daughter suffered a 45-minute long fit after taking ‘two pills’ at the event in Portsmouth, Hants, where headliners included Dizzee Rascal on Saturday night, and Craig David due to headline on Sunday.  Hampshire Constabulary said the two deaths, which are not being treated as suspicious, were separate incidents before organisers cancelled the rest of the festival this morning. Eyewitness Sam, 20, revealed that people were taking ecstasy tablets nicknamed “Green Heinekens” at the festival and that is what is believed to have caused the emergency. He said: “I saw the girl on the ground being treated by paramedics, it was a horrendous sight, she was in a very bad way. “People said she may have had two pills and if they were the Green Heinekens I can see why as my friend only had one and he was in a right state afterwards. “We had not heard anything about any drug warning, but as soon as people started getting ill it was blamed on the Green Heinekens.”  Mutiny Festival, held at Portsmouth’s King George V playing fields, was expected to attract 30,000 revellers over the course of the two-day event. On Thursday, just two days before the pair died, police said they would be clamping down on drugs at the event. Tributes have since been flooding in to the two young adults. Janine Milburn, Georgia’s mother, said “my little girl was 18 and full of life” and “I just hope this stops at least some of you ending up the same”. Her heartbreaking post read: “As I have now spoken to family members I can now say Georgia died yesterday due to complications after taking two pills at Mutiny. “If nothing else I hope what has happened to her will deter you from taking anything ever.” She continued: “The pills had caused her temperature to rise so high it made her fit for 45 mins. “This then caused her muscle to break down and turn her blood acidic. Her heart was irregular and stopped numerous times and then her lungs filled with blood and fluid and I made the decision to turn everything off. “My little girl was 18 and full of life, I just hope this stops at least some of you from ending up the same.” Georgia’s family did not wish to make a comment when a reporter visited their home in Havant, Hants. The family of Tommy, who goes by Tommy Bakeer and Cowan and is also from Havant, also did not wish to speak.

There were also claims revellers were taken ill at the festival after taking so-called \u0027Green Heineken\u0027 MDMA tablets. A statement released by organisers of Mutiny said: It is with tremendous sadness that we can confirm that two of our festival family died in hospital overnight. An 18-year-old woman and a 20 year old man were taken to Queen Alexandra Hospital where they sadly died. Following the terrible news from earlier today, the team behind Mutiny Festival are incredibly sad to announce that the Sunday of the festival has been cancelled as a safety precaution. The safety of our amazing customers has always been paramount to us and so to keep everyone safe and in respect to those who have passed, we have taken the decision not to open today. As you can imagine, this decision was not taken lightly and was taken with the support of the local statutory authorities who we continue to work with.

The retailer has found itself in the bottom two for its eighth consecutive year after shoppers panned it for poor customer service and value as well as for the standard of its shops  I find WH Smith very expensive and its stores need updating, one customer told Which?, while another said: I always use the self-service tills because the staff are rude.  A third shopper summed up the retailer\u0027s troubles, branding it hugely inferior to what it was in the past. WH Smith\u0027s poor performance comes only a week after it faced a backlash for overcharging customers for toothpaste and other toiletries in its hospital shops. Which? asked more than 10,000 shoppers about their shopping experience at 100 major retailers.  The customer scores given are based on customers\u0027 experiences of purchasing non-grocery items, their satisfaction levels and the likelihood of recommending each shop. Lush, Savers and Smyths Toys have been named the highest ranking shops a huge leap for three retailers that didn\u0027t even manage last year\u0027s top 10. Customers praised the smells of Lush stores, the prices at discount cosmetics store Savers, and the friendly and cheerful staff at Smyths Toys. Last year\u0027s top two, Toolstation and Richer Sounds - a winner at last week\u0027s Which? Awards - are now in fourth and sixth place, respectively. Despite only dropping by two percentage points, John Lewis, which finished joint third in 2017, falls to 10th place - its worst ranking since our annual survey launched in 2010.  But the department store\u0027s strength as an all-rounder was still evident, as it snatched the top spot in four categories - appliances and electronics, furniture and home, outdoor and sports and wellbeing and beauty. Price proved to be a deciding factor for many consumers - particularly when it came to everyday essentials - pushing stores like Savers up the rankings. Which? saw a similar trend in its recent supermarket survey, which this year saw Aldi overtake Waitrose for the first time in three years, proving that customers are sometimes willing to sacrifice their overall shopping experience if it means getting better value for money. Customers also favoured retailers that offered a sensory experience or specific expertise that is simply not available to them online. Getting top marks in this year\u0027s entertainment category was Waterstones, despite the rise of e-books and the popularity of online retailers like Amazon. People who gave it a high score commented on the stores\u0027 pleasant surroundings as well as the recommendations from friendly staff.

Cow\u0027s milk remains by far the biggest in the business. More than 750 million tonnes is produced and consumed every year. But as the global population grows and sustainability increasingly questioned, some are looking elsewhere for traditional food sources. After all, cows – all 1.5 billion of them – are the most damaging thing on the planet right now. More than cars, planes or nuclear testing.  All the other milks require farming. Goat\u0027s milk is obvious, but other sources, such as coconuts and rice, have an effect on the environment. Producing enough is hugely expensive and takes its toil on the land required for cultivation. Which is why people are milking cockroaches. They\u0027re cheap, rice in nutrition, and take up hardly any room. Some people are really drinking cockroach milk as a dairy alternative now. The milk is derived from \u0027cockroach crystals\u0027, a part of the insect found in its gut. According to scientists, these crystals are \u0027like a complete food\u0027, rich in essential amino acids and protein. A researcher from the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine in India claims the nutritional value of the cockroach product is much higher than other milks. What\u0027s more, apparently it tastes no different from cow\u0027s milk.  Milk sourced from Australian Pacific cockroaches is said to contain dietary sequences with all the essential amino acids, proteins, fats and sugars, and three times the energy of regular dairy milk. Some cockroaches lay eggs, but there is one species, called Diploptera Punctata, which gives birth to young and feeds them with milk. Diploptera Punctata is the only species of roach that gives birth to living offspring, as opposed to laying eggs, and produces milk to feed their young. South African company Gourmet Grubb is already farming cockroaches and producing milk fromthe bugs. The product is called \u0027Entomilk\u0027 and is created from sustainably farmed cockroaches. One of the most pivotal benefits of Entomilk is that it has a high protein content and is rich in mineral such as iron, zinc, and calcium, the brand says. But it\u0027s hard work. Being insects, it takes as many as 1,000 cockroaches to make just 100grams of milk, according to science website Inverse. And it\u0027s not just a case of attaching a machine to udders and massaging the teats.

The man, likened to web-slinging superhero Spiderman after the incident, sprang into action after the four-year-old boy was seen desperately clinging to a balcony in Paris on Saturday afternoon. Fire crews had already been called to the building at Rue Marx-Dormoy in the French capital\u0027s 18th arrondissement with a terrified neighbour on the neighbouring balcony struggling to help the boy back up.  And one brave man started climbing before emergency services arrived, with jaw-dropping social media footage showing him risking his life.  The man is seen clambering up the building, floor by floor, using only his bare hands to get a grip.  As he progresses towards the distressed child, he is urged on by a crowd of onlookers who had gathered below to catch the boy, should he fall. The hero appears to mount each level of the building with ease before reaching the boy. He then grabs the child by his hand and whisks him to the safety of the balcony to cries and applause from the watching crowd.   One witness, a 17-year-old student called Samy, told local website Le Parisien : All of a sudden, there\u0027s this guy who climbed every floor.  He took the child and put him back in his balcony. Everything happened so fast. He did not think, he went straight up. People were screaming, they were shocked.  When we saw that he had finally managed to climb up there, everyone shouted in relief. Both the hero and the boy were looked after by firefighters. The child escaped with just a torn nail, while the man suffered scratches from his climb.

Two of the eccentric Scherbinin’s five children, aged between 16 and 35, are older than the woman who will now become their stepmother and his “sixth and final wife”.  Yulia will fly to Dubai on honeymoon with Konstantin before splitting her time between his sumptuous homes in Moscow and Los Angeles, and enjoying his fleet of expensive cars and private jets, said the TV show. Three years ago Yulia arrived with no money in the Russian capital from Khabarovsk, a remote city in the east of Siberia. Since then she has become a student and works part time as an events manager.  “I am a fearless person,” she told the audience on U TV channel. “I made up my mind to move to Moscow and just did it, arriving with empty pockets,” she said, adding: “Not everyone would dare to do this.” Showing off her \u0026pound36,500 diamond ring, she boasted: \u0027Yes! Today I won .... “Here is my ring. I am the winner. I won. “That’s it. I did well. Who did well? I did.”  Her new beau told her: \u0027Yulia, princess. “You are very spectacular, kind, open - and this buys me. “You gave me spring and this means very much for a man. I feel your sincerity, appreciate this. But men are hunters, you need to understand this. “They do not like an easy prey.” "},{"url":null,"title":"spider man scaled building save","story":"NewsDad of four-year-old boy rescued by \u0027Spider-Man\u0027 after saving tot dangling from balcony \u0027had gone out to play Pokemon Go\u0027The four-year-old had been left alone in the Paris flat while his dad went shopping and played Pokemon Go, according to a French prosecutor\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMark ChandlerKelly-Ann Mills19:05, 28 MAY 2018Updated19:32, 28 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe father of a four-year-old boy rescued from a four-storey balcony by a French immigrant nicknamed \u0027Spider-Man\u0027 was playing Pokemon Go at the time, it\u0027s been claimed. Meanwhile Mamoudou Gassama - who has been hailed a hero after a video of his epic bravery in Paris was shared by millions on social media - is being granted French citizenship for his actions. The young boy\u0027s father is alleged to have been playing Pokemon Go in the street when his son fell and was left dangling, according to a French prosecutor. Mr Gassama, a migrant from Mali, was dubbed Spider-Man after he scaled the outside of the building as crowds watched on. Likened to the web-slinging superhero, Mr Gassama sprang into action after the young boy was seen desperately clinging to a balcony on Saturday afternoon.  Fire crews were called to the building at Rue Marx-Dormoy, in the French capital, as a terrified neighbour struggled to help the boy back up. But before they arrived, Mr Gassama was seen clambering up the building, floor by floor, using only his bare hands to get a grip. As he progressed towards the distressed child, he was urged on by a crowd of onlookers who gathered below to catch the boy. The hero appeared to mount each level of the building with ease before reaching the boy. He then grabbed the child by his hand and whisked him to the safety of the balcony. One witness, a 17-year-old student called Samy, told local website Le Parisien : All of a sudden, there\u0027s this guy who climbed every floor.  He took the child and put him back in his balcony. Everything happened so fast. He did not think, he went straight up. People were screaming, they were shocked. When we saw that he had finally managed to climb up there, everyone shouted in relief. Both the hero and the boy were looked after by firefighters. The child escaped with just a torn nail, while the man suffered scratches from his climb. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, speaking on French channel BFM TV , said: The father left the flat just as the incident was unfolding. He went shopping and then decided to play Pokemon Go in the street which took a little time before he returned home. He added: The father is very upset because he realises what he did and what could have happened. The boy\u0027s dad has not been named and has been told to appear in court in September. He could face two years in jail for failing to care for a child under French law.

The group\u0027s guru, hippy Georg Berres, claims he only found out it was the former champ\u0027s holiday home when German media turned up on the doorstep. Mr Berres said he wants to give the villa, named Son Coll in the rural north-east town of Arta, a spruce-up. Squatters have already cut weeds and picked up rubbish around the property. But Mr Berres, a 44-year-old carpenter, insisted this week he would leave if police turned up to tell him to go.   As of today, no complaint from the owner of the Majorca house is thought to have been received by Civil Guard officers.   Becker , 50, was declared bankrupt last June after blowing his \u0026pound100m fortune.  The triple Wimbledon champion’s wife Lilly vowed to stand by him but revealed in March their marriage came close to collapsing.  The retired tennis star purchased his Majorcan villa in 1995 and briefly put it on the market in 2007 for a figure reported to be close \u0026pound13million before withdrawing it shortly afterwards. Locals in Arta said last year around the time he was declared bankrupt they had not seen Becker for years. The pundit is thought to own Son Coll through a Spanish company.  Mr Berres, who moved to Majorca in 2014 and is understood to have lived in several “abandoned” houses on the island after time in a caravan, told German press he had “big projects” for the 31,000-square foot property. He said: “It could be a place for meetings, we would like to plant vegetables, offer seminars about renewable energy and other things that interest people.

She was just 45 when she died but she always held everything together.“She doesn’t have a headstone – the tree is effectively that – but when I go to that space I feel the presence of my mum.“It’s not a sad feeling. I feel a lot of joy, a lot of playfulness, and excitement for life, which is not something normally associated with death.“I hope that people viewing my work might take a sense of celebration and peace from it.”Janine’s project features line illustrations of plants surrounding the tree at Loch Katrine where her mother’s ashes were scattered.The interactive plates are illuminated in hues of blue and turquoise when activated, colours inspired from her research in cyanotype, and is a process that she hopes can form a connection between visitors to the show and the positivity that can be discovered after loss.The exhibit is accompanied by sound recordings taken at locations important to Janine, including Loch Katrine, Tentsmuir Forest, and the University’s own Botanic Gardens.Her showcase at the Degree Show is the culmination of a 13-year journey, one which celebrates the light that can be found in the darkest of moments and the abundance of life often left in the wake of loss.The Degree Show is one of the highlights of Dundee’s cultural calendar, and has already attracted thousands of visitors since opening to the public last week.Concluding on Sunday 27 May, entry to the event is free with further details available online.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afd4f2c1b303.jpg ","title":"dundee people fancy working at the va 32 new jobs announced ahead of museum opening","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThink you\u0026#8217ve got what it takes to work in Dundee\u0026#8217s hottest new attraction?

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million).

He didn’t play for the Toffees first team but did have loan spells at Norwich City and Crewe Alexandra before returning to Scotland in 2009 with Dumbarton.In the summer of 2009 he joined Partick Thistle, and during his spell at Firhill, Boyle had a loan stint at Clyde and then joined Dunfermline in 2011.Spells with Gateshead and Airdrieonians followed before he joined Ayr in 2015.McInally added: “We’ve got an experienced core of players with Paddy, Simon Ferry, Jamie Stevenson, Willie Gibson and Rory McAllister.“We could be looking at having an inexperienced central defence next season so it’s important to have experienced players such as Paddy as well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shire are shock troops while stoneywood dyce keep up their strong showing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeenshire became the shock troops of the Eastern Premier after travelling to Edinburgh and handing Heriots their first defeat of the season.The win saw them moving smoothly into third position in the top Scottish league.Chris Venske, the Shire captain, was over the moon with his under-strength side’s all-round performance.He said: “We controlled the game from start to finish, this despite not having Ian Kirk and John Dickinson available, and then losing the toss on a very good track.“Our opening bowlers Callum Mackaness and Finlay Anderson did a great containment job before new boy Harry Doley stepped up to the mark, taking three for 38.“When we batted, half centuries from Craig Knight (53) and our professional Askhu Fernando (62) were the stand-outs, but it was Mackaness who saw us home with an unbeaten 37.’’Venske played his part at the tip of the innings with a solid 26, although his opening partner Kenny Reid collected a second consecutive first ball duck.Back in Aberdeen, Stoneywood-Dyce continued their relentless pursuit of the Strathmore Union title at Mannofield in a high-scoring game which saw 466 runs, 101 of which came from Liam Lindsay, the Peoples Park side’s overseas amateur.In the company of his captain Jack Mitchell (72), the stylish South African enjoyed an unbeaten partnership of 193 to take the visitors to 267 for the loss of two wickets from their allocation of 45 overs.When Mannofield batted, they slumped to 25 for three, but then Fraser Proud (67) came to the crease, helping to put on 155 for the fourth wicket, only to see the side collapse from 180 for three to 199 all out after the partnership was broken.Mitchell said: “This was a good, solid win. It was a perfect batting track.“Once you got your eye in, it was hard to get out.’’His opposite number Kieran Findlay was disappointed to lose but said: “We pushed them all the way, but while we are playing well we need to start winning.’’At Countesswells, Gordonians made it two league wins in a row, led superbly by skipper Aman Arora who hit a fine 60 in his side’s total of 229 for eight before restricting Perth Doocot to 151 for the loss of nine wickets.Arora said: “We are starting to find some good form after our poor start to the season.’’Aberdeen Grammar FPs and Bon Accord maintained their 100% records at the head of affairs in Aberdeenshire Grade 1.The highlight of Grammar’s 121-run win at the Peoples Park was a hat-trick of Stoneywood-Dyce batsmen by Roland Knudson, while the Bons were equally easy 115-run winners at the Links.

There are no rules or limits to the imagination – they may want to be a wizard or superhero.If a child does not know what they want to be they can decorate their hat with something they are passionate about such as a sport, graffiti art, dancing shoes, or musical instrument.The idea behind the fun is to raise money for the UK’s leading children\u0026#8217s charity to help give thousands of disadvantaged children a better future. When they go into school, nursery or playgroup on May 18, parents and carers can make a voluntary donation of £1 to £2 to Barnardo\u0026#8217s Scotland.Children are full of surprises, and this is a fun way of allowing their imaginations to run wild in a way that will be inspiring, educational and raise money to help transform the lives of children who desperately need our support.It is easy to sign up on our website where you\u0026#8217ll find lots of resources and ideas to ensure your fundraising Hat Day will be a huge success and help support the children and young people we support in your local community.To register, visit www.barnardos.org.uk/hatday.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy. And we\u0026#8217ve got our two boys, so we\u0026#8217re quite occupied.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray progress in camanachd cup","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/05/18, 7:41 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Inveraray 2 Glasgow Mid Argyll 0Two early goals gave Inveraray a win over Glasgow Mid Argyll on a heavy Winterton pitch.Craig Taylor put Inveraray ahead on four minutes, with the ball taking a wicked bounce in front of the keeper.Lewis MacNicol doubled his side\u0026#8217s advantage on 15 minutes with a strike from the left which went across the keeper into the far corner of the net.Mid Argyll were struggling at the back but settled into the game and had a chance close to half-time to cut Inveraray’s lead when they were awarded a penalty.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Red Star won their only previous title \u0026#8211 SAFL Fourth Division \u0026#8211 in 1988 under manager Hughie Lindsay. There have been promotions, relegations and plenty of drama in between, but never a league crown.Red Star manager Dougie Moore said: \u0026#8216This is a major achievement for the club and for a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216We only have a small squad, but with some excellent players, many of whom have been involved with the Soccer Centre, which deserves great credit.\u0026#8216Seeing them play football with a smile and allowing them to express themselves on the pitch has been extremely pleasing and a personal highlight.\u0026#8217Led by Pipe Major Craig Lang and lead drummer Graeme MacMillan, Mid Argyll Pipe Band won the British Pipe Band Championship at Grade 4B.Craig, now in his sixth season leading the band, was \u0026#8216absolutely delighted\u0026#8217 to clinch first place among 21 competing bands.He added: \u0026#8216The band had an average age of 18 on Saturday at Paisley with four players in their first competition, one still in primary school.\u0026#8216It has taken years of hard work and a lot of that can be credited to Rod Buchanan for chanter lessons and Donald MacLachlan, our drum tutor.\u0026#8216It is also a great result for Graeme MacMillan, who returned after a five-year absence from the pipe band circuit to win a major.\u0026#8217The band celebrated in style on their return from Paisley with an impromptu performance in Lochgilphead town centre to the delight of band parents and supporters.Before heading to Tarbert on Sunday May 27 to play at the Scottish Series sailing event, Mid Argyll Pipe Band will be at the Ropework in Lochgilphead the day before to help Red Star celebrate.Star will receive the Premier 2 trophy at 3.45pm on Saturday and it is an occasion not to be missed.PICS:Mid Argyll Pipe Band members celebrates after their championship success. no_a21MAPBchamps01Pipe Major Craig Lang clutches the British championship trophy. 06_a21PipeBand08Lochgilphead Red Star AFC, league champions. 06_a18RedStar_TeamPhoto_home01\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Council chiefs shut a popular seafront tower amid safety fears in March. Now they have warned that the unit, enjoyed annually by thousands, will lie dormant until “later this year”. The multi-play tower is awaiting a \u0026pound260,000 overhaul after “a number of health and safety risks” were uncovered. Other equipment is still in use, but the giant climbing frame which anchors the park remains roped off. The lack of progress on a replacement has led to discontent among parents and political figures. Ayr west councillor, Martin Dowey, said: “As a tourist town, getting this replaced should have been high priority.  “Thousands of families will come to our beach over the summer and be left disappointed. “It is sadly indicative of a lack of progress from the council on many issues at the seafront.” Councillors signed off \u0026pound260,000 in their March budget to fund a replacement for the old play tower, which lasted 23 years. A council spokesman said: “The seafront play park remains open with funds agreed for a new play tower following the budget decision in March. “We are set to dismantle the old equipment in the next few weeks. “The new tower will be made to order and we expect it to be delivered later this year, it will then take a few weeks to install.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr roundabout named among uks","story":"NewsAyr roundabout named among UK\u0027s worstWhitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:14, 28 MAY 2018NewsWhitletts roundabout is one of the most dangerous in the UK (Image: IAIN BROWN)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA roundabout branded ‘Witless’ for striking fear into drivers has been named among the UK’s worst. Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

Although the 29-goal striker didn’t play in their title-winning match against Albion, he played a huge part in Ayr finishing top. And before he had time to recover from Saturday’s celebrations, it was party time again as he was crowned PFA League One Player of the Year. The prolific hitman said: “Winning the league was brilliant, but the way we won it was special. “Winning player of the year put the icing on the cake. “It’s the first senior title I have won – I won under-20 titles but nothing like this.  “I have never even been nominated before for a player award, so it’s quite surreal. “It’s probably the best weekend in my career, and I will never forget it.” But despite celebrating the title and looking forward to life in the Championship, United fans are nervously waiting to hear if Shankland will commit his future to Ian McCall’s side. He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

Ambassador Bowling Club president Anne Gibson said South Ayrshire Council’s new money spinner will stop some elderly members from getting out of the house. Ms Gibson said the Prestwick club is a social lifeline for older people including widowed folk. And during the cold, dark winter months it is somewhere safe to go to keep elderly people active. Finance bosses at the council want drivers to pay at Bellevue Road car park near the club and swimming pool. It is believed the move, which will roll out in other towns, will coin in \u0026pound120,000.  Anne said: “Our club is a social hub for elderly members. Eighty per cent of our members are aged over 73. They already pay because it is a private club. “We worry the car parking charge on top of that wil mean they can no longer afford it. There is a real threat the club may close or the parking charges will drive down membership numbers.” It is estimated the new fees will add \u0026pound3 to every game played. Anne continued: “South Ayrshire Council are supposed to encourage sport and leisure. This car park is used for the bowling club and the swimming pool. This should be a special case.” Describing individual member experiences, Anne said: “One of the men said he is recently widowed. He was depressed in the winter and said the bowling club was a Godsend to combat loneliness.  “His story is echoed by lots of people. Members have said if the club closed they don’t know what they would do. One lady had a fall and the doctor advised exercise like bowling, which is essential for health. They don’t like going out walking on their own. We offer a warm and friendly environment.” Coaching and rink space for blind bowlers is also provided. And young junior members are being coached to an international standard. She added: “Parking at a distance could prove hazardous for older members in icy or slippy conditions but that may be their only option if charges are introduced.” The club are collecting signatures for a petition.

South Ayrshire officials are to spend the summer soul searching in a bid to find a plan B for their Riverside project. And it could be the end of the year before the scheme is dragged back on track. It comes as new figures showed \u0026pound527,000 has already been blown – without a brick being laid. A “workstream to explore the options” was this week set to be approved, following rejection of a new \u0026pound11million office block. But a report on where to go next will not come before councillors until August at the earliest – after they return from their summer holiday.  Critics labelled the timetable “an insult” as the project threatens to plunge into crisis. Norman McLean, chair of Fort, Seafield and Wallacetown Community Council, said: “This is totally unacceptable. “What we need now is to fast track ideas and utilise the talents of those who can help. “Some ideas are simple and some are more complex, but we need urgent progress.” A “limited competition” open to a handful of “innovative design companies” is among the options favoured by Mr McLean. He added: “At this rate, we will be in December stuck in exactly the same position.” Conservative opposition leader, Councillor Martin Dowey, said: “We are sleepwalking our way into a disaster and nobody at the top seems willing to accept reality.  “Any suggestion that this can be kicked into the long grass is an insult. “It seems a case of crossing our fingers and hoping for a magic cure. “The sooner the council wakes up to what’s happening here, the better.” The Ayrshire Post contacted South Ayrshire Council last week for a statement on the \u0026pound527,000 spent thus far on the Riverside project. A council spokesman said: The expenditure is in line with expected costs for a project of this size and includes design team, project management and advisor fees, surveys and statutory consent.

Ayr’s historic Tam O’Shanter Inn will invest up to \u0026pound80,000 in the al fresco patio to the rear of its property. The boozer, run by David and Mareena Cowan, had gained council planning permission last month. But environmental health bosses this week said a “high chance of noise issues” was causing concern. “It would be remiss of us not to make an objection on these grounds,” they added. Pub boss David, addressing South Ayrshire’s licensing board, said: “We totally understand the concerns.  “But there will be no music played and this is purely and simply about serving teas, coffees and beer until the 10pm curfew.” David said the beer garden would, in the short term, be self-contained at the back of the Inn, which first opened in 1749. A longer term plan to gain access from the rear of the bar/restaurant would then be put in place. He added: “We see this as a good chance to generate extra employment for around five or six people. “The investment will run to between \u0026pound70,000 and \u0026pound80,000 – and not many people are investing in Ayr town centre at the moment.” David confirmed that six CCTV cameras would be installed to monitor the beer garden for security.  He said: “We envisage it being a safer environment than at present, as there can be quite a few issues there. “Perhaps this will encourage any undesirables to go elsewhere.” A limited range of draft beers, wines and spirits will be available at the bar, said David with all other alcohol served inside the traditional pub. Licensing board member, council leader Douglas Campbell, said: “It is welcome investment for the town centre and I’m sure it will be properly supervised.” The decision to approve the license was approved unanimously.

A shiny, newly constructed bus terminal would be half a mile across town to Burns Statue Square. And the historic train station would be prised apart from the Station Hotel and rebuilt as a modern standalone hub. The dramatic vision, which is only one of the options being considered, would also see a chunk of the hotel knocked down and the remainder converted to homes. The multi-million pound makeover of the town’s transport infrastructure depends on businesses such as Stagecoach and ScotRail buying into the idea. Parkhouse Street, which is home to a number of high-profile estate agents, would be pedestrianised in one option.  And the dual carriageway A70 leading from the Market Inn roundabout into the town could become single lane in either direction. Folk had the chance to see the ideas from Ayr Renaissance at a public exhibition in the Town Hall last week. Ayr Renaissance chair James Knox said: “We want to give everyone the chance to have their say on the masterplan for Burns Statue Square. “Nothing is written in stone. We have just begun the consultation process.” A council spokesman said: “We’re at the start of a process looking at options to regenerate Burns Statue Square and the Affleck’s block site, one of Ayr’s hidden gems behind the town hall. Some initial options were pulled together for the consultation last week, however we’re keen to hear more ideas from the public, so we’re looking at additional exhibitions in the near future.”  Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “This is a good opportunity to get on and regenerate Ayr town centre, which is badly needed. There are multiple issues that need to be addressed and we need all stakeholders to put the interests of Ayr first and foremost. “These are ideas that we can work with and shape to make Ayr better. But these improvements will only happen if we all pull together.” Consultants Ironside Farrar have been working on designs. Concerns have been mounting over the future of Ayr’s railway presence as the state of the Station Hotel continues to deteriorate.  The hotel owners have been told to carry out essential maintenance by the council and were slapped with a dangerous building notice. There are still question marks over the future of the Odeon amid speculation it could move to another location in the town. Office building Burns House has been labelled as not fit for purpose and is due to be demolished. But the new replacement building plans for the bottom of the town have been knocked back – throwing the office relocation timescale off. The timeline and budget for the Burns Statue Square makeover has not been released. Stagecoach and Network Rail did not reply to Ayrshire Post requests for comment before our deadline.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

Chairman of the club Peter Mason said: “I am very proud that we now have over 100 members. “In the two years since the group started many things have happened, many new friendships have been formed and many new skills learned. “These groups are going from strength to strength, and I would like to thank the group leaders for all the hard work they put into their groups week on week and also to the members who come along to support each group.” The group meet on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis, mostly at The Speakers, 8-10 Whitehall, on Maybole High Street.  From health and fitness classes like yoga and keep fit, sewing and a Knit and Natter class and even the opportunity to learn a new language with Spanish and German classes – there’s lots to do and new skills to achieve. Chairman Peter hopes more clubs can be formed to cater for even more members. He added: “For the future I hope to see some more new groups starting especially for male members as I am conscious that we do not have a lot to offer to them. “If we can retain our successes for another year, we will go from strength to strength and I hope each and every one of you will join me on that journey.” ● For more information of what activities are on offer, visit the website at www.mayboleover50s.org or contact club secretary Anne Walker on 07846 180753.

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12611218.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PCP_SDR_SCOTRAIL018JPG.jpg","title":"troon beach revellers face travel","story":"NewsTroon beach revellers face travel chaos as ScotRail services to Glasgow Central hit by signalling faultScotRail has announced that a signalling fault is causing cancellations and delays to its services between Ayr and Glasgow.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson14:48, 28 MAY 2018Updated16:23, 28 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of boozed-up teens face being stranded in Troon this afternoon after train services to Glasgow went down.
