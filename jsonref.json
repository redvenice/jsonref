Families split and you get on with your life.\u0027 When told that sounded cold, the actor replied \u0027Well, it is cold. Because life is cold.\u0027I don\u0027t find Sir Anthony\u0027s attitude that upsetting - probably because I had a whole host of problems with my own dysfunctional family. We were never close, and there were periods after I left home when we didn\u0027t speak for months, and then, one of us would hang up the phone in a fit of rage. A few years ago, I wrote best-selling book (Baggage) about my dreadul relationship with my mother, a difficult woman I never understood until after her death.REVEALED: Why Anthony Hopkins and his daughter have barely...Share this articleHundreds of women told me they had had difficult relationships with their mothers, and they had little in common. The relationship between fathers and their daughters is equally sacrosanct - if a parent dares to step out of line and tell the world that they can\u0027t stand their child, that they find it hard to be in the same room, that they have nothing in common, the world is disgusted, repulsed - you\u0027re not seen as \u0027human\u0027.Maybe this is because we live in an age of fake friendliness, people who you have only ever \u0027liked\u0027 on instagram or fakebook get rated as pals. We want everything, from relationships to families, to function in a warm lovely rosy glow, when life isn\u0027t not like that.           Some have questioned whether playing evil creeps has changed Hopkins\u0027 personalityFamilies are messy, full of liars and cheats and adulterers. The truth is, we are lonelier than ever, and have far fewer real friends that two decades ago.As for families - we are not connected by choice, but were born into them, and only blood ties us together. These days, people get married more than once, and have children with multiple partners. Sir Anthony Hopkins\u0027 daughter Abigail was born during his first marriage to Petronella Barker, one which didn\u0027t last very long. Abigail has consistently said he \u0027walked out on them\u0027 but in fact she and her father were speaking for a while, and he secured her small parts in two of her films. She changed her name to Harrison, presumably to try and start a career under her own steam, not hanging onto his coat tails.          If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say helloHopkins has been very candid about his struggles with booze and his unsociable behaviour, and hasn\u0027t touched alcohol since 1975. He moved to the US with his second wife and his career really took off, but he still sounds like an extremely hard man to be around, let alone be related to. He disappeared from his American home without warning and moved into another house for months on end, leaving his wife behind, and later lived as a hippie in the desert for a couple of months. He says he\u0027s been diagnosed with Asperger\u0027s, which might explain the need for solitude and struggles with empathy.Abigail - his only daughter - had a breakdown whilst studying at University, so they might have more in common than is immediately apparent. Hopkins has been happilly married to his third wife since 2003, and still lives in the USA. His daughter is now in her late forties and based in the UK, and they are never in touch. Abigail is said to blame her father for leaving her mother all those years ago, but isn\u0027t it time to move on? Her father is a talented artist, a gifted actor and musician. Why not celebrate what he\u0027s good at, not moan on what he lacks? Empathy might not be his forte, but he is undoubtedly telling the truth in his latest interview - life is cold, life is tough. Why pretend otherwise?We shy away from stark language like this - when people die, we talking of \u0027passing\u0027. When we want to contact someone we gush drivel about \u0027reaching out\u0027 - I want to retch. Let\u0027s revert to plain speaking. If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say hello.Sir Anthony is a proud old man who cannot be held responsible for what happened nearly half a century ago. I am sure he is self-centred, difficult, obsessive and a pain in the arse - but I\u0027d be happy to claim him as my dad.Meghan was criticised by some when it emerged that the only member of her family to be invited to the Royal wedding was her mother. She tried to include her dad - but he turned out to be a flake, although she remained loyal throughout the fiasco over whether he was coming or not and those ‘posed’ pap pictures. Her decision not to include her nephews was absolutely correct - the police visited their hotel room in London and confiscated a knife from Tyler (the cannabis grower) and an illegal pepper spray from his brother Thomas. The pair flew straight back to the USA after making an apology to the police - to avoid being arrested and charged.Meghan\u0027s decision to exclude her family was wise - luckily she has a mother who\u0027s a better role model than that tawdry bunch.Sir Anthony Hopkins isn\u0027t the only person whose life functions better without pretending every relative is a best buddy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/10/4C9D17C200000578-0-image-m-10_1527240775310.jpg","title":"Sturgeon bids revive floundering Scottish independence campaign","story":"    Nicola Sturgeon (pictured yesterday in te Scottish Parliament) today tried to revive her floundering bid for Scottish independence by pleading with voters to see it as an escape from the \u0027despair of Brexit\u0027Nicola Sturgeon today tried to revive her floundering bid for Scottish independence by pleading with voters to see it as an escape from the \u0027despair of Brexit\u0027. The Scottish First Minister is publishing a new report on how independence would work today despite repeated setbacks at the ballot box as voters reject the idea.Ms Sturgeon insisted there was now a \u0027very different political and economic situation\u0027 to when the last referendum was held in 2014. Her report advocates keeping the pound during a transition period after an independence vote - before potentially moving to a new currency. She said: \u0027There is no status quo and we know that being taken out of Europe and out of a market around eight times bigger than the UK market alone will hit our economy.\u0027That is why it is time to begin a fresh debate and to replace the despair of Brexit with optimism about Scotland\u0027s future.\u0027We look forward to debating the report\u0027s recommendations - both within the SNP and with business, trade unions and communities across Scotland.\u0027 Corbyn admits he would NOT fight to keep Britain together in...Share this articleThe Sustainable Growth Commission was set up to look at the future economic prospects of Scotland.The 354-page report will outline that the pound should remain as Scotland\u0027s currency for a period of time after any break from the Union.There has been speculation the country would then move to a new Scottish version of Sterling.

She previously took part in the kingdom\u0027s first driving protest in 1990, in which 47 women were arrested          Hessah Al-Sheikh has also been freed. She\u0027s a professor at King Saud University and volunteers with Saudi-based charities focusing on women and childrenIn 2016 Al-Hathloul attended a humanitarian summit together with the now Duchess of Sussex, Emma Watson, Cher as well as the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.In one picture Meghan was in a group of four posing by the water\u0027s edge alongside al-Hathloul, poet Fatima Bhutto and former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson.The \u0027global leaders\u0027 all spoke at the One Young World Summit taking place in Ottawa at the time.

Saudi activist and campaigner Aziza al-Yousef is said to be one of the arrested activists She has worked for years assisting women fleeing abusive marriages and homes.

He was later led out in handcuffs and taken to a criminal court where he pleaded not guitly.He posted $1 million cash bail, and was released on condition he wore a GPS bracelet. In December, Damon, landed himself in hot water when he spoke about the #MeToo movement in a series of interview promoting his latest film Downsizing. In one interview with Business Insider, Damon reminded women that not all men in Hollywood were predators.\u0027We\u0027re in this watershed moment, and it\u0027s great, but I think one thing that\u0027s not being talked about is there are a whole s**tload of guys - the preponderance of men I\u0027ve worked with - who don\u0027t do this kind of thing...I don\u0027t do that, and most of the people I know don\u0027t do that,\u0027 he said. In another interview with ABC\u0027s Peter Travers, Damon said it was important to recognize that there is a spectrum of offenses.           Weinstein turned himself in today at a New York police station on sexual misconduct charges          He was later led out in handcuffs and taken to a criminal court where he will be officially charged\u0027I do believe that there\u0027s a spectrum of behavior, right?

With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th.

There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company. They do, however, have a small weekend cottage in Gloucestershire.

Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/13/4C9DC0CA00000578-0-image-a-93_1527250987996.jpg","title":"The Hipster Fascists Meet Britains sinister far Right group","story":"    Tom Dupre is the leader of the far-Right group Generation Identity (GI UK) and is openly an admirer of Enoch Powell, the Tory minister best known for his 1968 Rivers of Blood speech It is no surprise to learn that Dupre is a fan of the late politician. The former junior city banker is the leader of a new far-Right movement in Britain called Generation Identity (GI UK).Unlike the traditional image of the far-Right, epitomised by shaven-headed thugs from groups such as the English Defence League and National Action, Tom Dupre is well-spoken, educated, polite and personable. It makes him more plausible and, ultimately perhaps, more dangerous than the easily-dismissed stereotypes from this end of the political spectrum which we have become accustomed to.The bank holiday getaway heats up!

They’ve been accused of using modern branding and sophisticated coded language to ‘normalise’ extremist views.But Dupre insists Generation Identity is neither fascist nor racist, despite the fact that it is campaigning to preserve ‘our ethnocultural identity’ against what it describes as the ‘great replacement’ of white people in Britain’s cities with black and minority ethnic people.    The group, which includes Benjamin Jones, pictured, has been dubbed \u0027Hipster Fascists\u0027The rhetoric echoes Powell’s infamous speech, in which he recounted a conversation he’d had with a middle-aged constituent who had voiced his fear that ‘in this country in 15 or 20 years’ time, the black man will have the whip hand over the white man’.The words, spoken 50 years apart, might be different, but the message delivered by Tom Dupre and Enoch Powell is the same.Posters in Manchester last week reinforced that message, declaring that ‘each new census heralds the end of England and the English. By 2061, we will be nothing more than a footnote in the history books.’The group, which claims to have members in every major city in the country, was launched last summer in the UK with a banner being unveiled on Westminster Bridge reading: Defend London — Stop Islamisation. It was emblazoned with the ‘lambda’ symbol, the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet, which has become the official logo of GI UK.The lambda is synonymous with the ancient military republic of Sparta, famous in battle for being ‘a patriotic army defending its native soil’.The symbolism is obvious.          Jordan Diamond, pictured, who is a leading member of the group, has been previously filmed expressing his concern about being \u0027swamped by the third world\u0027GI UK members come from ‘all walks’ of life, the promotional material informs us. However, the leadership is exclusively middle class, as are many of its activists. Universities up and down the country have been targeted for potential recruits.Tom Dupre himself grew up in a six-bedroom £1 million home in Sevenoaks, Kent. His parents were co-directors of a firm of insurance brokers his mother, a volunteer with the Samaritans, ran a local children’s choir. Both his brother and sister, an opera singer, went to Cambridge. A more unlikely family background for a far-Right leader would to be hard to imagine.Dupre studied psychology at Bristol University, speaks several languages and is an accomplished clarinet player.Until this week, he worked for Standard Chartered in the bank’s glass-fronted HQ in the heart of the City, near Mansion House, where a bright future beckoned until his political activities came to light last weekend. He was dismissed a few days ago following an internal investigation.Dupre’s closest associate is Ben Jones, the 24-year-old co-leader of Generation Identity. At first glance, his life is a picture of suburban respectability. He lives in the Midlands with his fiancée and two border collies. Jones has a degree in journalism and works in marketing.A third key figure within the organisation is Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, 38. She graduated, she says in her online CV, in business management and economics from prestigious University College Dublin, before joining a number of firms in the U.S. including the Federal Aviation Administration and Saab. She has also run her own video production company.‘We want to bring a revival to our culture and our way of life,’ she said in a recent newspaper interview. ‘Our biggest concern, of course, is becoming a minority in our own country.’ GI UK founding members also include the son of an accountant and an IT specialist with a leading cyber security firm.So, the demographic make-up of GI UK could not be more different from the English Defence League or the banned National Action. The tactics of this group are very different, too. There have, for example, been no provocative marches, no clenched fists and no violence.Still, in under a year, Generation Identity has become the most active far-Right organisation in Britain.In place of rallies, they like to spread their message through meetings, leaflet-drops, recruitment drives and ‘study circles’.It is within these seemingly civilised gatherings, which have been held in towns and cities from Luton to the Lake District, that activists discuss ‘identitarian’ ideology. Word of these meetings tends to be featured on GI UK’s Facebook page.One photograph on Facebook shows young Tom Dupre and two supporters, wearing bright yellow waterproof tops with the lambda logo, handing out food to the homeless at King’s Cross and Moorgate stations in London.‘Warm pork suppers’ were deliberately chosen to exclude Muslims, claim anti-fascist campaigners.Dupre strenuously denies this. ‘It had nothing to do with being anti-Muslim,’ he insisted to the Mail.But he did go on record to confess that he does not regard Mayor of London Sadiq Khan as European. Not because he is a Muslim, he says, but because ‘he’s against British values’.          Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, who attended University College Dublin, said in one newspaper interview \u0027our biggest concern is becoming a minority in our own country\u0027You may well not know this, but last December, GI UK staged a tasteless publicity stunt to embarrass Mr Khan. Someone playing the part of the Mayor, accompanied by two people in niqabs, went to Westminster Abbey and St Paul’s Cathedral to ask people to sign a petition to ‘ban Christmas’. Thankfully, the stunt received little publicity.Generation Identity’s first British conference was held last month — in Tom Dupre’s home town.The gathering at The Stag Theatre in Sevenoaks, Kent, ended with the police being called when anti-fascist protesters, in black balaclavas, descended on the venue. Witnesses described how a young GI member was chased across the car park by masked men — proof that extremism, even when it is clothed in middle-class normality, almost always breeds more extremism.The conference was news-worthy for another reason. Two senior GI figures from Europe — one of them was Austrian Martin Sellner — were detained and deported as they tried to enter the country to attend the event. This is evidence, if any were needed, that the authorities are not taking the potential threat posed by GI UK lightly.GI UK is part of a 13-nation European network which claims to have thousands of supporters in France, Germany and Austria, and an extensive infrastructure including branded bars and gyms.Unlike their British counterparts, the methods employed by European ‘Identitarians’ are far less subtle. They have mounted missions to ‘defend Europe’. They have chartered boats to disrupt operations in the Mediterranean to rescue refugees, and have conducted ‘patrols’ of the French border in the Alps.Sellner, a student of law and philosophy, who makes a living as a graphic designer, is the leading GI figure on the Continent. Often seen wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses, he has strong links with his counterparts in Britain.After being prevented from attending the conference in Sevenoaks, he instead spoke to Tom Dupre, live on stage, via a video link.The European experience of this group offers a salutary warning for Britain.‘Identitarians’ argue that globalisation has created a homogenous culture with no distinct national or cultural identities. This can only be reversed, they claim, by ‘remigration’.In Britain, critics insist, this would mean the forced removal and repatriation of non-white and Muslim immigrants who GI UK believe shouldn’t be resident here. Such a credo took hold in France around six years ago and has grown stronger following the wave of ISIS terror attacks across Europe.What is happening in Europe was exposed by undercover reporters from ITV last year. In a documentary, members of Generation Identity were seen practising hand-to-hand combat at an ‘Identitarian Summer University’ in France.This was, in effect, a military-style training camp. Members were also filmed taking part in a mock demonstration (complete with pepper spray) before ‘passing out’, wearing uniforms bearing GI’s distinctive lambda logo.Jordan Diamond, one of the early leaders of GI UK, has been filmed attending other GI events with Martin Sellner. Diamond, smartly-suited and in his early 20s, who was brought up in a picture postcard village in the North- West of England, has been recorded talking about his fears of being ‘swamped’ by the Third World.‘Would you,’ he has asked rhetorically, ‘be happy, honestly, if white people didn’t exist? Because naturally, at the rate it’s going, we’re not going to.’Diamond insisted, however, that he was not racist, arguing that no indigenous population should become a minority in its own land. He has said that he does not condone violence.In other footage online, Diamond has spoken about the need to mobilise ‘99ers’. These are young people born since the Millennium, whom he wants to be taught to protect what he describes as their ‘white heritage’.‘We’ve not got much time,’ he said in one address. ‘When the 99ers turn 30, our fate will be sealed. It’s down to our generation to make some change.’Diamond’s childhood home is in a millionaires’ row of mock Tudor houses and gated walled mansions. Diamond’s father is an accountant with the NHS and his mother is a music teacher. A sports car was parked on the drive earlier this week. Neighbours of the family say their son went to university.On Twitter, where he has 2,500 followers, Diamond describes himself as an ‘identitarian’ and quotes Winston Churchill: ‘There is a forgotten, nay almost forbidden word, which means more to me than any other. That word is England.’Back in Sevenoaks, Tom Dupre, described by one who used to know him as ‘a lovely lad from a very liberal family’, declined to say what his friends, parents and extended family think of his views.However, he insisted: ‘We reject racism. We are not fascist.‘We do not want to throw all foreign people out of England. We’re not against all immigration or all immigrants at all.‘But my generation is much more concerned about the issues we are raising than people who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s.‘We have grown up with terrorist attacks in London.

As we continue to make using a handheld mobile behind the wheel as socially unacceptable as drink-driving, we would hope to see an even bigger reduction in those going to court throughout 2018.’He added: ‘You are twice as likely to crash while text-driving as drink-driving, so the best way for drivers to avoid picking up their phone is to turn the phone off before their journey and convert their glove box into a phone box.’Despite the figures being hailed as a success, there are concerns that the fall in convictions could also be due to fewer people being caught after a drop in the number of frontline traffic police officers.

Activists say al-Hathloul was arrested again in June of last year in connection with her advocacy.Activists say al-Hathloul was then stopped by authorities in Abu Dhabi, where she was residing, and transferred to Saudi Arabia earlier this year where she\u0027s been under a travel ban since March.Al-Hathloul attended a humanitarian summit in Canada in 2016, where she was photographed in Vanity Fair magazine with former American actress Meghan Markle, who wed Prince Harry over the weekend.AZIZA AL-YOUSEFA retired professor at King Saud University, al-Yousef is a mother of five and a grandmother of eight.Although she hails from a conservative tribe with links to the royal family, she is among the most prominent women\u0027s rights activists in Saudi Arabia. In 2016, she delivered a petition signed by thousands to the royal court calling for an end to guardianship laws that give male relatives final say over a woman\u0027s ability to marry or travel abroad.          Saudi activist and campaigner Aziza al-Yousef is said to be one of the arrested activists She has worked for years assisting women fleeing abusive marriages and homes. She also defied the kingdom\u0027s ban on women driving on several occasions.\u0027This is a good step forward for women\u0027s rights,\u0027 al-Yousef told The Associated Press last year when the kingdom announced that women would be allowed to drive. However, she cautioned it was just \u0027the first step in a lot of rights we are waiting for.\u0027EMAN AL-NAFJANAn assistant professor of linguistics and a mother of three, including a toddler, al-Nafjan runs one of the first English blogs on Saudi Arabia.She describes the \u0027Saudiwoman\u0027 blog as an effort to counter the many non-Saudis and non-Arabs \u0027out there giving \u0027expert\u0027 opinions on life and culture\u0027 in the kingdom.Al-Nafjan has protested the driving ban, including publicly driving in the capital, Riyadh, in 2013 as part of a campaign launched by women\u0027s rights activists.           Eman al-Nafjan runs one of the first English blogs on Saudi Arabia and protested the driving ban She has worked closely with al-Yousef and other women\u0027s rights activists to help domestic abuse victims and bring attention to repressive guardianship laws.In recent years, she has been cautious about voicing her opinion on Twitter out of concern over a growing crackdown on rights advocates. She was among dozens of women who were warned by the royal court last year to stop speaking with the press or voicing opinions online.MADEHA AL-AJROUSHA psychotherapist in her mid-60s, al-Ajroush runs a private therapy practice in the capital, Riyadh, which specializes in gender orientation, according to activists.She helped initiate a nationwide program in Saudi Arabia to provide support for domestic abuse victims and train police and courts on how to receive and treat such victims.          Madeha al-Ajroush is said to be one of the detained women. She helped initiate a nationwide program in Saudi Arabia to provide support for domestic abuse victims and train police and courts on how to receive and treat such victimsA longtime advocate of women\u0027s rights, she took part in the kingdom\u0027s first driving protest in 1990 and subsequent campaigns to end the ban on women driving.She has faced years of harassment by authorities, including house raids, travel bans and being fired from her job.Last year, al-Ajroush told the AP after women were promised the right to drive: \u0027I had no idea it was going to take like 27 years, but anyway, we need to celebrate.\u0027AISHA AL-MANALike al-Ajroush, the 70-year-old al-Mana took part in the kingdom\u0027s first driving protest in 1990, in which 47 women were arrested.She also took part in driving protests in 2011 and 2013.She is director of Al-Mana General Hospitals and the Mohammad Al-Mana College of Health Sciences.           Aisha al-Mana previosuly took part in the kingdom\u0027s first driving protest in 1990, in which 47 women were arrestedShe completed her bachelor\u0027s and master\u0027s degrees in the U.S. in sociology. In 1980, she became one of the first Saudi women to obtain a Ph.D., also in the U.S. from the University of Colorado.In 2016, she established a scholarship program for Saudi women to study global health at her alma mater. She also established a $2 million endowment to support Saudi and Arab women at the American University of Beirut who are studying advanced degrees in nursing and health sciences.Activists say she suffered a stroke last year and are concerned for her health while in detention.IBRAHIM AL-MUDAIMIGHAl-Mudaimigh is a lawyer who defended al-Hathloul during her detention in 2015 for attempting to cross the UAE-Saudi border while driving. He has supported human rights defenders in court and offered legal representation to activists in the kingdom.He\u0027s also represented Waleed Abulkhair, a human rights lawyer now serving a 15-year sentence who\u0027d represented Raif Badawi, a blogger who was publicly flogged in 2015 and is serving 10 years in prison.Activists say al-Mudaimigh, who ran his own practice, was one of the few lawyers in Saudi Arabia willing to defend human rights activists since others have either fled or been detained.HESSAH AL-SHEIKHA longtime women\u0027s rights activist who took part in the kingdom\u0027s first driving protest in 1990, al-Sheikh is a professor at King Saud University and volunteers with Saudi-based charities focusing on women and children.She hails from the prominent Al Sheikh family who are descendants of Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Abdul-Wahhab. His ultraconservative teachings of Islam in the 18th century are widely referred to as \u0027Wahhabism\u0027 in his name.          Hessah Al-Sheikh is a professor at King Saud University and volunteers with Saudi-based charities focusing on women and childrenShe co-authored a 100-page study that was published this year by the Center for Women\u0027s Global Leadership in partnership with Rutgers University, examining Saudi women\u0027s advocacy since 1990. The study says questions remain over whether new policies will lead to real changes in how women\u0027s lives are governed in Saudi Arabia.The study notes that international media exposure \u0027can be a protective shield against severe punishment for active engagement in women\u0027s causes.\u0027WALAA AL-SHUBBARActivists say al-Shubbar, in her late 20s, works as a nurse in the capital, Riyadh. She has been active in calling for an end to guardianship rules and appeared on Arabic news programs to discuss issues of patriarchy in the kingdom.          Activists say al-Shubbar, in her late 20s, has been active in calling for an end to guardianship rulesIn an interview previously aired on France24, al-Shubbar is quoted as saying that in Saudi society \u0027men are viewed as superior to women, and men are seen as capable of achieving anything and a woman is not.\u0027MOHAMMED AL-RABAEAl-Rabea is a writer and an activist in his 20s who has organized discussion groups about philosophy and social issues. He worked with some of the activists to push for greater women\u0027s rights.ABDULAZIZ AL-MESHAALThe Gulf Center for Human Rights describes al-Meshaal as a businessman and philanthropist who was listed as a board member in an application by activists to the government to establish a non-governmental organization called \u0027Amina\u0027 to protect women survivors of domestic violence.                                                      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/08/4CA15C8200000578-5771809-image-m-26_1527320873160.jpg","title":"Pensioner battling council EIGHT YEARS flowers","story":"    Thelma Peppert has lived in Rose Cottage in the village of Dalton Piercy, near Hartlepool, since 1967          Pictured: Rose Cottage in 1967, the year Mrs Peppert moved in to the country home          Since moving into the listed building, Mrs Peppert (pictured) has tended a flower border by her front wallEight years on and a petition has now been launched after the council sent a letter to 92-year-old Mrs Peppert requesting that she remove it - or they will.Mrs Peppert\u0027s son John Proudlock, who lives with his disabled mother and is her full-time carer, said the letter from the council left her physically sick.Lady Gaga shows off her ample cleavage in skimpy red dress...\u0027The English clubs were ahead of the rest of Europe... our...\u0027Doomed\u0027 northern white rhino CAN be resurrected: Frozen...Share this article\u0027My mother is housebound and in deteriorating health, the house and flowers have been her pride and joy for 50 years,\u0027 he said.\u0027The threat of the needless destruction of such a pretty flower border is causing her huge distress and anxiety.

And it is their belief, he said, that Mrs Peppert and her son John are deliberately trying to block the way for a proposed footpath to the side of their house which would lead to a new children\u0027s play area for the villagers to enjoy.

There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company.

Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/13/4C9DC0CA00000578-0-image-a-93_1527250987996.jpg","title":"The Hipster Fascists Meet Britains sinister far Right group","story":"    Tom Dupre is the leader of the far-Right group Generation Identity (GI UK) and is openly an admirer of Enoch Powell, the Tory minister best known for his 1968 Rivers of Blood speech It is no surprise to learn that Dupre is a fan of the late politician. The former junior city banker is the leader of a new far-Right movement in Britain called Generation Identity (GI UK).Unlike the traditional image of the far-Right, epitomised by shaven-headed thugs from groups such as the English Defence League and National Action, Tom Dupre is well-spoken, educated, polite and personable. It makes him more plausible and, ultimately perhaps, more dangerous than the easily-dismissed stereotypes from this end of the political spectrum which we have become accustomed to.The bank holiday getaway heats up! Millions take to the...Two British tourists are arrested over the suspected rape of...Share this articleHe was smartly dressed in a business suit during our encounter with him, but slick publicity photos of him and his fellow ‘patriots’, as they like to call themselves, show them in skinny jeans, trendy trainers and sunglasses with some sporting upswept hair and beards.The Sunday Times has described them as the ‘Hipster Fascists’. They’ve been accused of using modern branding and sophisticated coded language to ‘normalise’ extremist views.But Dupre insists Generation Identity is neither fascist nor racist, despite the fact that it is campaigning to preserve ‘our ethnocultural identity’ against what it describes as the ‘great replacement’ of white people in Britain’s cities with black and minority ethnic people.    The group, which includes Benjamin Jones, pictured, has been dubbed \u0027Hipster Fascists\u0027The rhetoric echoes Powell’s infamous speech, in which he recounted a conversation he’d had with a middle-aged constituent who had voiced his fear that ‘in this country in 15 or 20 years’ time, the black man will have the whip hand over the white man’.The words, spoken 50 years apart, might be different, but the message delivered by Tom Dupre and Enoch Powell is the same.Posters in Manchester last week reinforced that message, declaring that ‘each new census heralds the end of England and the English. By 2061, we will be nothing more than a footnote in the history books.’The group, which claims to have members in every major city in the country, was launched last summer in the UK with a banner being unveiled on Westminster Bridge reading: Defend London — Stop Islamisation. It was emblazoned with the ‘lambda’ symbol, the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet, which has become the official logo of GI UK.The lambda is synonymous with the ancient military republic of Sparta, famous in battle for being ‘a patriotic army defending its native soil’.The symbolism is obvious.          Jordan Diamond, pictured, who is a leading member of the group, has been previously filmed expressing his concern about being \u0027swamped by the third world\u0027GI UK members come from ‘all walks’ of life, the promotional material informs us. However, the leadership is exclusively middle class, as are many of its activists. Universities up and down the country have been targeted for potential recruits.Tom Dupre himself grew up in a six-bedroom £1 million home in Sevenoaks, Kent. His parents were co-directors of a firm of insurance brokers his mother, a volunteer with the Samaritans, ran a local children’s choir. Both his brother and sister, an opera singer, went to Cambridge. A more unlikely family background for a far-Right leader would to be hard to imagine.Dupre studied psychology at Bristol University, speaks several languages and is an accomplished clarinet player.Until this week, he worked for Standard Chartered in the bank’s glass-fronted HQ in the heart of the City, near Mansion House, where a bright future beckoned until his political activities came to light last weekend. He was dismissed a few days ago following an internal investigation.Dupre’s closest associate is Ben Jones, the 24-year-old co-leader of Generation Identity. At first glance, his life is a picture of suburban respectability. He lives in the Midlands with his fiancée and two border collies. Jones has a degree in journalism and works in marketing.A third key figure within the organisation is Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, 38. She graduated, she says in her online CV, in business management and economics from prestigious University College Dublin, before joining a number of firms in the U.S. including the Federal Aviation Administration and Saab. She has also run her own video production company.‘We want to bring a revival to our culture and our way of life,’ she said in a recent newspaper interview. ‘Our biggest concern, of course, is becoming a minority in our own country.’ GI UK founding members also include the son of an accountant and an IT specialist with a leading cyber security firm.So, the demographic make-up of GI UK could not be more different from the English Defence League or the banned National Action. The tactics of this group are very different, too. There have, for example, been no provocative marches, no clenched fists and no violence.Still, in under a year, Generation Identity has become the most active far-Right organisation in Britain.In place of rallies, they like to spread their message through meetings, leaflet-drops, recruitment drives and ‘study circles’.It is within these seemingly civilised gatherings, which have been held in towns and cities from Luton to the Lake District, that activists discuss ‘identitarian’ ideology. Word of these meetings tends to be featured on GI UK’s Facebook page.One photograph on Facebook shows young Tom Dupre and two supporters, wearing bright yellow waterproof tops with the lambda logo, handing out food to the homeless at King’s Cross and Moorgate stations in London.‘Warm pork suppers’ were deliberately chosen to exclude Muslims, claim anti-fascist campaigners.Dupre strenuously denies this. ‘It had nothing to do with being anti-Muslim,’ he insisted to the Mail.But he did go on record to confess that he does not regard Mayor of London Sadiq Khan as European. Not because he is a Muslim, he says, but because ‘he’s against British values’.          Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, who attended University College Dublin, said in one newspaper interview \u0027our biggest concern is becoming a minority in our own country\u0027You may well not know this, but last December, GI UK staged a tasteless publicity stunt to embarrass Mr Khan. Someone playing the part of the Mayor, accompanied by two people in niqabs, went to Westminster Abbey and St Paul’s Cathedral to ask people to sign a petition to ‘ban Christmas’. Thankfully, the stunt received little publicity.Generation Identity’s first British conference was held last month — in Tom Dupre’s home town.The gathering at The Stag Theatre in Sevenoaks, Kent, ended with the police being called when anti-fascist protesters, in black balaclavas, descended on the venue. Witnesses described how a young GI member was chased across the car park by masked men — proof that extremism, even when it is clothed in middle-class normality, almost always breeds more extremism.The conference was news-worthy for another reason. Two senior GI figures from Europe — one of them was Austrian Martin Sellner — were detained and deported as they tried to enter the country to attend the event. This is evidence, if any were needed, that the authorities are not taking the potential threat posed by GI UK lightly.GI UK is part of a 13-nation European network which claims to have thousands of supporters in France, Germany and Austria, and an extensive infrastructure including branded bars and gyms.Unlike their British counterparts, the methods employed by European ‘Identitarians’ are far less subtle. They have mounted missions to ‘defend Europe’. They have chartered boats to disrupt operations in the Mediterranean to rescue refugees, and have conducted ‘patrols’ of the French border in the Alps.Sellner, a student of law and philosophy, who makes a living as a graphic designer, is the leading GI figure on the Continent. Often seen wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses, he has strong links with his counterparts in Britain.After being prevented from attending the conference in Sevenoaks, he instead spoke to Tom Dupre, live on stage, via a video link.The European experience of this group offers a salutary warning for Britain.‘Identitarians’ argue that globalisation has created a homogenous culture with no distinct national or cultural identities. This can only be reversed, they claim, by ‘remigration’.In Britain, critics insist, this would mean the forced removal and repatriation of non-white and Muslim immigrants who GI UK believe shouldn’t be resident here. Such a credo took hold in France around six years ago and has grown stronger following the wave of ISIS terror attacks across Europe.What is happening in Europe was exposed by undercover reporters from ITV last year. In a documentary, members of Generation Identity were seen practising hand-to-hand combat at an ‘Identitarian Summer University’ in France.This was, in effect, a military-style training camp. Members were also filmed taking part in a mock demonstration (complete with pepper spray) before ‘passing out’, wearing uniforms bearing GI’s distinctive lambda logo.Jordan Diamond, one of the early leaders of GI UK, has been filmed attending other GI events with Martin Sellner. Diamond, smartly-suited and in his early 20s, who was brought up in a picture postcard village in the North- West of England, has been recorded talking about his fears of being ‘swamped’ by the Third World.‘Would you,’ he has asked rhetorically, ‘be happy, honestly, if white people didn’t exist? Because naturally, at the rate it’s going, we’re not going to.’Diamond insisted, however, that he was not racist, arguing that no indigenous population should become a minority in its own land. He has said that he does not condone violence.In other footage online, Diamond has spoken about the need to mobilise ‘99ers’. These are young people born since the Millennium, whom he wants to be taught to protect what he describes as their ‘white heritage’.‘We’ve not got much time,’ he said in one address. ‘When the 99ers turn 30, our fate will be sealed. It’s down to our generation to make some change.’Diamond’s childhood home is in a millionaires’ row of mock Tudor houses and gated walled mansions. Diamond’s father is an accountant with the NHS and his mother is a music teacher. A sports car was parked on the drive earlier this week. Neighbours of the family say their son went to university.On Twitter, where he has 2,500 followers, Diamond describes himself as an ‘identitarian’ and quotes Winston Churchill: ‘There is a forgotten, nay almost forbidden word, which means more to me than any other. That word is England.’Back in Sevenoaks, Tom Dupre, described by one who used to know him as ‘a lovely lad from a very liberal family’, declined to say what his friends, parents and extended family think of his views.However, he insisted: ‘We reject racism. We are not fascist.‘We do not want to throw all foreign people out of England. We’re not against all immigration or all immigrants at all.‘But my generation is much more concerned about the issues we are raising than people who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s.‘We have grown up with terrorist attacks in London. I was just seven years old when I saw the Twin Towers collapsing on the TV. It did not make sense to me. A lot of people my age feel the same way.’Yet, critics claim that behind the slick branding and expertly produced promotional videos of Generation Identity lies an ugly message of white supremacy and ‘racial separatism’.These young men might look the picture of respectability with their snazzy suits, fashionable labels and super-cool haircuts. Their rhetoric, however, tells a different story.One of Tom Dupre’s big questions during a recent address to a GI convention was: ‘Are we a threat?’ Compared to the bomber jackets and beer bellies of the English Defence League, the answer, quite possibly, is very much, yes.Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron and Mark Branagan"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9F5FA300000578-0-image-m-68_1527260898804.jpg","title":"Actress Maureen Lipman faints stage West End performance","story":"    Actress Maureen Lipman has fainted on stage during a West End performanceJames Norton dons spectacles and a retro woollen suit as he...Share this articleAn employee at the theatre said: \u0027She did faint, but everything seems to be fine, she did not go to hospital or anything, she just went home for the evening.\u0027Quizzed on how Lipman was, they said: \u0027I did not see anything wrong, she was alert and talked normally - I don\u0027t know why she fainted but as far as I could tell she seemed fine.\u0027It is understood the show stopped for around 10 minutes after she became unwell, restarting with someone else playing her character. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/00/4C956FD900000578-0-image-m-5_1527292199051.jpg","title":"Number people caught using phones wheel drops third","story":"Motorists now face six points on their licence and fines of £200 if they are caught using a handheld mobile phone while behind the wheel of their carThe number prosecuted for the offence also fell 30 per cent from 12,853 to 9,039, meaning the conviction rate is 92 per cent.The figures from the Ministry of Justice show that a total of 86 per cent of drivers prosecuted for using their phone at the wheel were men.The introduction of tougher penalties followed the Mail’s End the Mobile Madness campaign, which highlighted the shocking scale of the problem and a spate of deaths caused by drivers distracted while using their phone at the wheel.UK backs the decision to hold Russia legally responsible for...Share this articlePolice forces vowed to take a tougher stance on the offence after being accused of turning a blind eye in too many cases.Motorists who use a phone while driving now face six points on their licence and a £200 fine – up from the previous three points and £100. Those caught using their mobile twice or accruing 12 points on their licence face being disqualified and fines of up to £1,000.Jack Cousens, of the AA, said: ‘Campaigns by both the AA and the Mail have clearly contributed towards the reduction of people being presented at court for using a handheld mobile phone behind the wheel, which has dropped by more than a quarter. As we continue to make using a handheld mobile behind the wheel as socially unacceptable as drink-driving, we would hope to see an even bigger reduction in those going to court throughout 2018.’He added: ‘You are twice as likely to crash while text-driving as drink-driving, so the best way for drivers to avoid picking up their phone is to turn the phone off before their journey and convert their glove box into a phone box.’Despite the figures being hailed as a success, there are concerns that the fall in convictions could also be due to fewer people being caught after a drop in the number of frontline traffic police officers. The number of road police officers fell by nearly a third between 2007 and 2017, from 3,766 to 2,643.          The Mail has a long-running campaign to target motorists using their mobile phones while behind the wheel of their carsA poll of 19,500 drivers carried out by the AA found two-thirds of motorists think they can get away with careless driving due to a lack of police on the roads.The official figures also revealed a drop in convictions for speeding, drink-driving and failing to stop or provide information after a crash.Despite a rise in car thefts, the number of people convicted of the crime fell more than 10 per cent last year to 4,441.Speeding accounted for just over half (51 per cent) of the 664,000 drivers prosecuted for motoring offences last year.The number of prosecutions for causing death or injury by dangerous driving hit 900, the highest level in a decade.Steve Double, a Tory member of the Commons transport committee, said: ‘I’ve been out with the police and it’s clear they take a hard line on anyone they see using their phone while driving.‘These figures are encouraging. A combination of greater awareness and tougher penalties does seem to be working.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/06/4CA339EA00000578-5773895-During_intermittent_explosions_at_Kilauea_s_summit_ash_shoots_hi-a-25_1527313241219.jpg","title":"Volcanic ash turns one campus nearly grey","story":"    This explosion at Kilauea Volcano\u0027s summit, which occurred just after 6:00 p.m. HST on May 24, 2018, produced an ash cloud that rose to 10,000 feet above sea level  During intermittent explosions at Kilauea\u0027s summit, ash shoots high into the sky (pictured) and drifts down onto small rural villages across the island          The smog and ash has led to many absences, with 48 per cent of students missing school one day last weekKau High and Pahala Elementary School is inundated with gritty, gray ash that has been spewing out of a volcano some 20 miles  away.During intermittent explosions at Kilauea\u0027s summit, including one late Thursday, ash shoots high into the sky and drifts down onto the small, rural campus and nearby areas.No matter how often Akamu sweeps the floors or how many times custodians spray water on buildings, a dusting of ash leaves a normally green tennis court looking gray.

One day last week, 48 per cent of students were out, she said.School officials have been monitoring air quality. Students were kept inside Wednesday morning, when sulfur dioxide emissions were high.Officials have handed out ash-filtering masks, though they keep running out because some kids misplace them.

Volcanic ash covers coffee plants at the Ka\u0027u Coffee Mill in Pahala, Hawaii, U.S., May 25, 2018. An eruption Thursday night sent an ash cloud about 10,000 feet into the air. Neal said she didn\u0027t notice much more ash after that, likely because the winds had died down.The National Weather Service said it expects trade winds to slow this weekend, creating hazardous air quality. Volcanic gases, pollution and ash could increase along with sulfur dioxide levels downwind of lava fissures.Volcanic ash is the reason the area has such rich soil for crops, such as coffee, Akamu said. \u0027We\u0027re not complaining about the ash.

The latest figures will further stoke concerns over the strength of the UK economy, amid increasing signals for deteriorating growth as Britain prepares to leave the EU next year. Some economists, including officials at the Bank of England, thought the growth rate would be revised higher as more data became available.Threadneedle Street delayed raising interest rates earlier this month after the weak first GDP estimate, despite arguing that the negative hit to the economy from heavy snowfall in late February and early March had probably been overblown. Instead the ONS said it had seen a longer-term pattern of slowing growth in the first three months of the year.Rob Kent-Smith of the ONS said: “Overall, the economy performed poorly in the first quarter, with manufacturing growth slowing and weak consumer-facing services.”While admitting bad weather will have had some impact, particularly for firms in the construction industry and some areas of the retail business, statisticians said the overall effect was limited, with increased online sales and heightened energy production during the cold snap. Much will now hinge on how consumers fare over the coming months, with some early indications there could be a rebound in stronger retail sales data for April.

The celebrations continue over the weekend with live music, dancers from China and Bangladesh and poetry readings. “It doesn’t surprise me that so many people came on the opening day,” says Pere Escofet, standing at his brand new cheese and charcuterie stall. “This market is very symbolic and there was a lot of expectation.” Barcelona’s barris, or neighbourhoods, revolve around their markets. There are 39 food markets in the city and no one is more than a 10-minute walk away.  “The market generates business, it’s a point of attraction but it’s also a social nexus,” explains Agustí Colom, head of commerce on the city council and the man charged with implementing Barcelona’s costly citywide market renovation plan. “People don’t just shop, they talk and they feel part of a community. We run programs in markets for elderly people who feel isolated. Because they’re regular customers, there are people there who know them and to whom they can talk about their problems.”  Sant Antoni actually consists of three markets. As well as a food area with 52 stalls, there are 95 stalls in the Encants (enchantments), the lightly ironic Catalan term for a flea market. In this case it mainly sells cheap clothes. On Sundays, Sant Antoni also hosts one of Europe’s largest open-air book markets, with 78 stalls selling new and secondhand books, comics, stamps and other collectables. The market’s move to a temporary structure nearby lasted longer than expected as excavations for an underground car park uncovered part of the ancient city wall, as well as a stretch of the Roman Via Augusta that runs from the Pyrenees all the way to Cádiz in southwest. There were inevitable delays after the archaeologists were called in and the architects, Pere Joan Ravetllat and Carme Ribas, were obliged to rethink the design. All but four of Barcelona’s 39 markets have had a makeover, with Sant Antoni the most expensive. The Mercat de Santa Caterina, which was rebuilt by Enric Miralles, architect of the Scottish parliament building, ran over budget when work unearthed a 12th-century convent and a Roman necropolis.  So what drove the city to invest tens of millions in refurbishing its markets? “Spending on markets is probably one of the investments with the biggest return, both economically and socially,” says Colom. “This network of markets gives us a city that is structured much better than most.” One notable feature of the refurbished markets is that each includes a small supermarket. While the rent they pay helps the city to recoup its investment, Colom insists that the supermarkets are not in competition with the stallholders. “A supermarket attracts more people to the market and they shop in both,” he says.  As people begin to care more about fresh food and its carbon footprint, the markets are becoming more attractive, he says, and since the citywide refurbishments began the number of people shopping in them has risen. The city has also initiated a “green market” campaign to encourage stallholders to prioritise local produce.  Sant Antoni was the first market to be built outside the city’s medieval walls. It was initiated by Ildefons Cerdà, the architect responsible for the Eixample, the grid system of streets that extended Barcelona beyond the Old City. In common with several other markets in the city it took advantage of the novel technique of erecting steel-framed buildings.  It opened in 1882 and by the time it closed in 2009 it had become a gloomy warren of stalls and bars. “Now everything is new and works a lot better,” says Escofet. “But costs are higher, we have to pay for cleaning and parking and the air conditioning is more expensive because the price of electricity has shot up.” Colom points out that the €80m price tag includes both the cost of the temporary market and, more importantly, the creation of the city’s second “super block”– covering a 26,000 square metre area surrounding the market. The blocks are designed to “bring life to the street” by prioritising pedestrians over cars, with newly planted trees and children’s play areas. The Sant Antoni neighbourhood, once reminiscent of one of the poorer Paris arrondissements, is undergoing a process of gentrification. Rents are rising and some of the city’s must upmarket restaurants have moved in. And then there are the tourists.  Some fear the revamped market will follow the city’s famous Boqueria, now so overwhelmed by tourists photographing the food that it’s effectively a no-go zone for residents. Part of the problem is that the city, while investing in the markets for its citizens, also promotes them as tourist destinations. Colom insists that what the city and the stallholders want is for Sant Antoni to be for local people.“The Boqueria is next to the Rambla,” says Escofet, referring to Barcelona’s iconic and tourist-plagued pedestrian thoroughfare. “This is not the same situation. There’s more tourism here than before because there are more tourist apartments, but this is a family market.” Colom says they have reduced the number of bars in the market from 10 to three and tourist-oriented outlets will be discouraged. For now, everyone in Sant Antoni seems happy to have their market back.

I was lucky enough to be there, and have been thinking ever since about the videos he showed. In one, a Cha’palaa speaker in Ecuador goes to a hole-in-the-wall shop and asks for some cooking oil. Receiving it, he turns away and leaves. In another, a British student eyes up another’s biscuits and asks for one. As he reaches into the proffered packet, he smiles and says, “Sweet!”This week, Royal Society Open Science published Floyd and his colleagues’ work, and caused a flutter. The Times headlined its piece “Britons really do say ‘thank you’ more than anyone else”. The Independent referred to Britain’s famed “unrelenting penchant for\u0026nbsppoliteness”.If Britain is famed anywhere for “unrelenting politeness”, it is nowhere more so than in Britain itself, where the national reputation for good manners is treated as a badge of honour. While there’s plenty of British self-deprecation in the use of words like “please”, “thank you” and “sorry”, it comes with some implicit self-congratulation: we use these words because we’re so polite, the reasoning goes. The unspoken assumption is that others are less so.Some humility (not the same as self-deprecation or politeness) might be in order here, since the research does not show that the British thank “more than anyone else”, but that they thank more (in certain situations) than seven other cultures. Whether British English speakers thank more than people in China, Japan, India or the Middle East is yet unknown – and whether the British thank more than other English speakers is yet another matter. Research for the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English, for instance, found that Americans say “thanks” or “thank you” twice as much in conversation as Britons, while Britons say “please” twice as much as Americans.That doesn’t mean Britons make politer requests or that Americans are more grateful. It means that we’ve acquired different habits. With Rachele De Felice of University College London, I’ve been trying to dig down into those numbers. If “thank you” is used at different rates in two cultures, it probably means different things to those cultures. Indeed, in our studies of British and American email correspondence, we’ve found that Britons are more apt to begin emails with thanks for the previous message, while Americans are more likely to thank people for their time or interest. We’ve also found that the lesser American use of “please” is offset by more expressions of appreciation in making requests.British “thanks” comes into its own at the shop till. I was inducted into this thanking culture in the early 2000s, when I was a fresh immigrant from the US, and volunteered in a Brighton charity shop. There, to my surprise, I learned that English shop assistants and patrons can begin an interaction with “thank you” the customer who places a box of Christmas cards in front of the shop assistant can use “thank you” to indicate that they are ready to start a transaction. The assistant may then say “thank you” as they take the item to ring up. Before the end of the interaction, what with the back-and-forth of credit cards or cash, pin machines or change, receipts and bagged goods, there may well be half a dozen more thanks. Do these thanks show gratitude? An alternative reading (made in the 1970s by sociolinguist Dell Hymes) is that the British “thank you” sometimes means “I am asking you to take the next turn in this interaction” or “I am accepting that it is my turn to do something in this interaction”.When we visit other cultures that don’t use thanking to manage their interactions in the same way, it can feel off-putting. But to conclude from ample “thanks”-giving that “we’re more polite” is only to conclude that “we do the things we consider polite more often than other cultures do the things we consider polite”. Hardly a surprising finding.The prevalence of thanks in English-speaking cultures doesn’t show we care more about others and the impositions we make on them. It may instead be a side-effect of our culture’s inidualism. I have to thank you because I cannot assume that we’re close enough for you to naturally be generous towards me. In a more intimate situation or collectivist culture, expressing “thanks” can imply “I\u0026nbsphadn’t trusted that I could count on you for that.”Anyway, thanks for reading.• Lynne Murphy is professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex and author of The Prodigal Tongue: the Love-Hate Relationship between British and American English"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e922f7665467b27f7da168ff5e1b321069ea81ae/0_162_3520_2112/master/3520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=518e1aa46c3fa2f72e12770a4db478e3","title":"jeremy corbyn prime minister eu brexit october general election","story":"Unhappy Brexiteers could yet force an October general election, and open the way for the Labour leader to reshape BrexitThe idea that the British people are on the brink of “liberation” from the European Union is starting to look very odd indeed. The evidence increasingly suggests that by the middle of the next decade, we may very well still be fully bound by most of the key terms and conditions of EU membership.Yet while we may be obliged to accept EU laws and regulations affecting the single market and the customs union and still have to pay into the EU budget, the British people may notice one difference: we will have neither voice nor vote in determining European laws and regulations. We will be law-takers, not lawmakers.There is likely to be another serious inconvenience to doctrinaire Eurosceptics: the UK may not be able to actually implement any of the promised “amazing trade deals” with the rest of the world until the mid-2020s. In the meantime, it should be noted, Commonwealth countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand are indeed already busy finalising or negotiating some amazing new trade deals. But these are with the EU, not the UK.Legally, we are on course to leave the EU next March that’s when the period allowed under article 50 for negotiating the principles of a new relationship with the EU expires. We then have a further short period, until the end of 2020, to finalise a new, full-scale trade and cooperation treaty with Europe.The trouble is that – outside the May cabinet – no one any longer really believes in this sort of timetable. It is conceivable, but improbable, that the article 50 deadline could be extended by a very short period, but there will be serious legal problems to face. What is more likely is that the subsequent transition (or implementation period), during which the substance of a new treaty would have to be agreed, could be extended.UK customs experts have joined British business and industrial leaders in saying significantly more time will be needed before the UK would be anything like prepared for life outside the customs union and single market. Hence discussion of further proposed deadlines, ranging from the end of 2022 to around 2025.Two major political events in the UK could upend this kind of extended period of grace. The first is the possible collapse of the May government. This may not transpire, but no one can ignore the ever louder drumbeat from hardline Brexiteers that an October general election cannot be ruled out.What is beyond question is that it is a constitutional obligation for the next general election to be held no later than early summer 2022. Even at that stage, the UK may still be in a state of limbo in relation to the EU – bound by obligations, but deprived of democratic rights.In the event of an election this autumn, the focus would increasingly shift from how May can survive and complete the Brexit process to how a Jeremy Corbyn-led government would handle the Brexit process if elected. Indeed, in the event of an October election, he would have to make it clear how he would handle future talks with Brussels.He may state unambiguously that he wishes to reopen negotiations with Michel Barnier, the European council, and indeed the European parliament, at the earliest possible date. He could signal that a Labour government would approach these talks in a very different manner – and say that Labour wants to commit to the standards set by the EU in areas such as workers’ rights and social standards. Corbyn might also express readiness to back further strengthening of EU-wide environmental standards and democratic rights.In particular, as prime minister, there’s a good chance that Corbyn would support some of the reforms now promised by the European commission – notably the planned new European Labour Authority. More specifically, the mooted reforms of the posted workers directive – to close loopholes in free movement exploited by rogue employers to undermine local wages and labour conditions – would be attractive to Corbyn. As a Labour prime minister who pledged to end austerity and gross inequality, his government will have every interest in cooperating as closely as possible in a Europe-wide strategy for faster growth and job generation.For its part, the EU would have every interest in giving an incoming Labour government time to talk through these issues with Brussels – and perhaps an opportunity to put the results to parliament or the people for approval through a referendum.It is worth remembering that, before the 1975 EU referendum, Harold Wilson opposed the terms of the agreement which had been negotiated by Edward Heath’s Tory government. The resulting so-called “renegotiated agreement” was then endorsed in that referendum. A Corbyn “reform and remain” agreement would give voters a constructive alternative to being in the EU only for obligations, and out in terms of democracy and law-making rights.• John Palmer is a former European editor of the  and former political director of the European Policy Centre"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44a907a988a05425d55a38143918e713ec961fe3/0_32_3336_2002/master/3336.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4c957faf85581e90700b82cd4b7e43e","title":"senior epa officials collaborated with climate change denial group emails show","story":"Newly released emails show senior officials from the Environmental Protection Agency worked closely with conservative thinktank the Heartland InstituteNewly released emails show senior Environmental Protection Agency officials working closely with a conservative group that dismisses climate change to rally like-minded people for public hearings on science and global warming, counter negative news coverage and tout Scott Pruitt’s stewardship of the agency.John Konkus, EPA’s deputy associate administrator for public affairs, repeatedly reached out to senior staffers at the Heartland Institute, according to the emails.“If you send a list, we will make sure an invitation is sent,” Konkus wrote to the then Heartland president, Joseph Bast, in May 2017, seeking suggestions on scientists and economists the EPA could invite to an annual EPA public hearing on the agency’s science standards.Follow-up emails show Konkus and the Heartland Institute mustering scores of potential invitees known for rejecting scientific warnings of human-caused climate change, including from groups such as Plants Need CO2, The Right Climate Stuff and Junk Science.The emails underscore how Pruitt and senior agency officials have sought to surround themselves with people who share their vision of curbing environmental regulation and enforcement, leading to complaints from environmentalists that he is ignoring the conclusions of the majority of scientists in and out of his agency, especially when it comes to climate-changing carbon emissions.They were obtained by the Environmental Defence Fund and the Southern Environmental Law Centre, which sued to enforce a Freedom of Information request. The EPA maintains close working relationships with a broad range of public and private groups, and Heartland is just one of many the agency engages with “to ensure the public is informed”, said the EPA spokesman Lincoln Ferguson.“It demonstrates the agency’s dedication to advancing President Trump’s agenda of environmental stewardship and regulatory certainty,” he said.The public hearing referred to in the May 2017 email was cancelled when the EPA official who runs it fell ill, the EPA said.But Bast contended in an email sent to EPA staffers and others that the official called off the hearing after learning that climate change “sceptics planned to attend”.The Heartland Institute calls itself a leading free market thinktank. It rejects decades of science saying fossil-fuel emissions are altering the climate and says on its website that curbing use of petroleum and coal to fight climate change would “squander one of America’s greatest comparative advantages among the world’s nations”.“Of course The Heartland Institute has been working with EPA on policy and personnel decisions,” Tim Huelskamp, a former Kansas Republican congressman who now leads the group, said in a statement. “They recognised us as the pre-eminent organisation opposing the radical climate alarmism agenda and instead promoting sound science and policy,” Huelskamp wrote.He said Heartland would continue to help Pruitt and his staff.Ferguson said Pruitt and his top officials had also met with groups known for their campaigns against climate-changing emissions and pollutants from fossil fuels, including the Moms Clean Air Force, the American Lung Association, and others.But Ben Levitan of the Environmental Defence Fund said mainstream climate-change groups have received nothing like the outreach and invitations that Heartland and other hard-right groups have been getting.Certainly, “in some ways this is normal and in the course of business that ebbs and flows with the ideology of the administration in power”, said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, a not-for-profit group promoting ethical government and bipartisan political reform.An email last February shows Bast forwarded to followers an email with the line “From the White House”, rallying activists to public hearings the EPA was then holding around the country on repealing an Obama-era power plan meant to curb fossil-fuel emissions.The email is signed by a Pruitt political appointee and gives the name of another EPA official for activists to call. It’s not clear from the email, however, who initiated the attempt to rally conservatives for the public hearing.The Washington Post reported in September that Konkus had been scrutinising grant applications for mentions of climate change, which he reportedly calls “the double C-word”.Emails show he and former EPA spokeswoman, Liz Bowman, repeatedly reached out to Heartland to talk over critical coverage by the Post.And an email from Bast, shared with EPA staffers and others, shows the then-Heartland president celebrating news that a reporter, Justin Gillis, was leaving the New York Times.“Ding Dong, the Witch is Dead. Still waiting for Chris Mooney and Juliet Eilperin at the WaPo and Seth Borenstein at AP to flame out,” Bast writes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/233f1ec684e15247b26a82bcf183d0443069fa60/0_0_5508_3305/master/5508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188d236bbeb75e48c918d5a2562747a1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Wild horses, an Ethiopian wolf and a dolphin attacking a porpoise are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df4818ca6aa2b20ba7d03fb76d70d5c4e001595/0_337_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=327d159d0ba1c148f1e98a5c8ce5e6fa","title":"bonnie wright from harry potter to a menopause movie","story":"Playing Ginny Weasley aged nine was Wright’s first job. Now in her late 20s, she talks about directing her Potter peers and her new AS Byatt AdaptationAn unassuming hairdressing salon in a shopping precinct in Lincoln is an unlikely venue for the world premiere of a film directed by a globally famous actor. But behind a velvet rope, between the washbasins, that is exactly what is happening in Sincil Salon in Sincil Street in Lincoln town centre. The film is called Medusa’s Ankles, and the director is Bonnie Wright – better known to tens of millions as Ginny Weasley in the Harry Potter film series.The venue, in fact, is wholly appropriate: Medusa’s Ankles, adapted from a short story by AS Byatt, is set entirely in a hairdresser’s. It stars Kerry Fox as a woman disconcerted by the signs of ageing – particularly her greying hair, which she is determined to keep “natural” – and Jason Isaacs as a charismatic, bullying hairdresser with whom she has a fraught, fractious relationship. The 20-minute film is showing over three days in the salon, which will be open for normal hairdressing operation throughout.“What’s so great about this,” says Wright, “is that we spend so much time experiencing things on the internet and social media that an actual physical film screening is rare.” Wright also says she likes the “exhibition-y” feel of the event, which appears as much a gallery installation as a cinema premiere. The screening has been organised by Lincoln-based Mansions of the Future, a three-year cultural project designed to “allow the public to collaborate directly with artists” future events include a new production with nonprofessional actors of Steven Berkoff’s 2001 play Ritual in Blood, about the medieval “blood libel” surrounding Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln. Wright very much approves of Mansions of the Future’s aim to bring culture to the people: “I was very lucky to have grown up in London and had that access to the arts. The way I got into this was through culture and education, and it’s so important to take it outside of the capital city.”Wright, 27, bears little resemblance to the pale-faced schoolgirl we last saw settling down to raise a family with Harry Potter (after helping to see off Voldemort’s army at the climactic Battle of Hogwarts). Since finishing the series eight years ago in 2010, she has opted to develop a career largely behind the camera, directing short films, shooting music videos and art projects and recently branching out into commercials. Unlike her fellow Potter alumni, Wright has taken only a few acting jobs since, opting instead to study film-making at the London College of Communication and setting up her own production company in 2012.Medusa’s Ankles has an unlikely subject for a film-maker in her late 20s: a woman experiencing a menopausal midlife crisis. “It’s something I am obviously yet to experience!” she says. “But I think I and a lot of people can understand it: we’ve all sat in a hair salon and been at the mercy of someone else’s opinion. Sometimes you go in knowing exactly what you want, other times it’s about what they think you should have. The story – and the film – is about that sensory interaction, that heightened space between the hairdresser and their client.”The film, she says, is also partly intended as a showcase for how she can handle larger sets and complex lighting setups (“It’s definitely strategic”), and she has her sights set on a full-length feature film. Wright is a committed activist for environmental causes, and is working on a script that, she says, is “heavily inspired by the work I’ve been doing with Greenpeace around ocean plastics, but with a mythological and science fiction twist”.Wright is keen to show she has moved on from Potter, but acknowledges the debt she owes to the role she secured as a nine-year-old after her older brother Lewis suggested she go along to an open casting call. “At the beginning I was in complete awe of whole thing,” she says. “All of us were pretty much learning about film-making and acting as it was happening. It was only as the films developed and the characters became more complex that it became more like a job. Looking back, what I loved about those films is that everyone, from the cinematographer to the set designer, were at the top of their field. To watch people for whom the craft of film-making was so important – that stayed with me.”She also credits the Potter films for pushing her towards writing and directing: “Doing such big films gave me a desire to get more out of film-making, to get deeper into the process. When you are acting you are observing so much happening around you. I am directing actors having been directed myself, and there is specific type of language you have that is so unique. If you’ve been on the other side of it, it’s such a lovely experience.”Wright has not been shy about putting her industry contacts to good use. Her graduation film, a 10-minute drama about a small girl who befriends a bereaved older man, featured David Thewlis, who played Remus Lupin in the Potter films and the star of her second film, a poetic piece about a young man dealing with the death of a lover, was Christian Coulson, who played the teenage Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Isaacs, in her new film, is another Potter regular, having played Lucius Malfoy in six of the films.“For sure, I have an advantage in terms of the access to these people,” she says, “as well as to the experiences I’ve had along the way. But respecting that is really important. If you are going to call upon actors or connections, it’s important not to utilise them when they are not needed. Only if the actor would be right for the role, rather than choosing them for the sake of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1fab6440f682619e6b2041e33fe41102afed9df/0_244_3162_1897/master/3162.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26d263b3809999b07a205f64df3a280f","title":"cristiano ronaldo mohamed salah real madrid liverpool final championsh league","story":"Mohamed Salah, in the red of Liverpool, and Cristiano Ronaldo, in the white of Real Madrid, will be expected to score goals tonight worthy of European football’s annual showpieceTwo teams of 11 men apiece will emerge into the Olympic stadium in Kiev on Saturday night for the 2018 Champions League final but much of the attention of Europe’s fans will be focused on two iniduals whose head-to-head battle is likely to define an outcome worth not just around £80m to the winner but pride and prestige of incalculable value.Mohamed Salah, in the red of Liverpool, and Cristiano Ronaldo, in the white of Real Madrid, will be expected to score goals worthy of European football’s annual showpiece. In that sense the two men play the same role but in very different ways and with strongly contrasting personal styles.A 33-year-old Portuguese who has spent the last dozen years competing with Barcelona’s Lionel Messi for the title of the world’s best player, Ronaldo has preened and strutted like a superstar since he was a teenager. In big matches he celebrates his goals by removing his jersey to reveal an astonishing display of musculature, tanned, oiled and depilated to perfection it is honed by a ferocious fitness regime involving exposure to temperatures reaching -200C in a cryotherapy chamber, high-pressure water massages and improbable numbers of one-armed press-ups.He came to prominence under Sir Alex Ferguson with Manchester United before moving to Madrid in 2009 for a world-record £80m fee, having won every available inidual award during his five seasons in English football. He has scored 121 goals in 156 Champions League matches and is on course to become the competition’s top goalscorer for an extraordinary sixth year in a row, with 15 in 12 matches so far in the present campaign. He has been awarded the Ballon d’Or five times – the same as Messi – and is the all-time top scorer for his country and Real Madrid.Salah, an altogether less self-conscious figure, spent an inconclusive season at Chelsea in 2014-15 before moving to Roma and rebuilding his career effectively enough to attract the interest of Liverpool’s manager, Jürgen Klopp. He returned to England a year ago for a fee of £36.9m – a relatively modest sum, given the world record stands at £200m – and is now the idol of the red half of Merseyside and all of Egypt.As well as bringing him player-of-the-year awards from his fellow professionals and the football writers, his 44 goals for Liverpool this season in all competitions obliterated fans’ painful memories of the loss to Barcelona first of Luis Suárez and then, this past January, of Philippe Coutinho. Each had been a prolific goalscorer few anticipated that Salah, who had failed to impress José Mourinho while at Stamford Bridge, would outshine them both. Ten of his goals this season have come in the Champions League, carrying Liverpool to within touching distance of their sixth win in the competition.Ronaldo was born in Funchal, the largest city of Portugal’s Madeiran archipelago, where his mother worked as a cook and his father as a gardener. With a dedication to self-improvement that has impressed a succession of managers, he turned himself into the greatest Portuguese player of all time, his deeds eclipsing those of Eusébio, the Mozambique-born forward who won the European Cup with Benfica in 1962 and was top scorer at the 1966 World Cup. Ronaldo is bidding for his fifth European Cup winner’s medal while his club are going for their 13th title, and their third in a row.Salah is from Nagrig, a farming community in the Nile Delta, 80 miles from Cairo, where he was born into a middle-class Muslim family. His childhood was spent reading his schoolbooks during the long journey to and from training sessions with El Mokawloon, a Cairo club, involving several buses in each direction. Now he is Africa’s player of the year and his popularity at home is such that in the recent Egyptian presidential elections a million voters are said to have written in his name on their ballot papers.His Liverpool wages have subsidised a youth centre and an ambulance station in his home town, and he is building a school to provide a non-extremist Muslim education for girls and boys. Ronaldo has given money, including his £600,000 winning bonus from last year’s Champions League final, to many causes, one of them a school in Gaza.At their best each man offers a thrilling spectacle. Where Ronaldo surges and shimmers before bemusing goalkeepers with shots that weave and dip viciously, Salah simply explodes. From his regular station on the right wing, he cuts inside his marker and moves across the face of the penalty area before shooting with his stronger left foot, usually aiming to place the ball inside the far post.Both have alternative weapons in their armoury. Ronaldo, at 6ft 2in, has the power and the leap that enable him to score memorable headed goals. The 5ft 9in Salah exploits his low centre of gravity to twist and turn inside the penalty area, flicking the ball away from more cumbersome opponents with something of Messi’s mesmerising deftness.A sixth win for the pouting and obsessively groomed Ronaldo, now with the edge perhaps gone from his once blistering speed, or a first for the smiling, tousle-headed Salah, entering his prime propelled by an infectious optimism? Whichever way it goes, this is one final likely to justify the hype."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f12c60a23678d1c502434b9614ce72589632c344/0_193_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24226fd8ed60fb2b722e09fba737fdc1","title":"sergio ramos leadership real madrid champions league final","story":"He raps, has dozens of tattoos and knows nothing but Champions League success as Madrid’s captainSergio Ramos was born with golden balls. That’s what Sergio Ramos says, anyway – and, he adds, they’re right where they’re supposed to be. It’s no Ossie’s Dream and it’s not the Anfield Rap either, but this week Real Madrid’s captain released a cup final song of his own: a European Cup final song, offered up with the words “my house, some friends, a lot of magic and this is the result: my life in a song and lots of verses still to write”. With the usual rapper’s brag and bravado, SR4 tells his journey from the streets – well, the square in Camas, Seville – to the World Cup and close to another Champions League title. Already “a legend,” as the track has it, it would be his fourth.Nothing was handed over free, runs one line of the rap “his ‘testiculine’ is not for sale, it comes out as a Panenka” – that moment when, in the semi-final of the 2012 European Championship, he dinked in a penalty. That was one of a handful of moments that define a player with a gift for the epic and the grand gesture, for goals too, late ones, important ones, who is almost a cartoon character at times. It was also two months since the European Cup semi-final when, during the shootout, he sent the ball sailing over the bar and some, including Manuel Neuer, into fits of laughter. That night Ramos vowed that he would show them. So he did.When he missed the penalty against Bayern Munich, it denied Madrid a shot at their 10th European Cup. They had waited a decade and it had become an obsession. Two years later they reached the final against Atlético, but it was slipping away they were “on a tightrope”, as the track has it. The clock showed 92.48 – a number that makes up one of the dozens of tattoos he has, the latest added a few days ago – when Ramos headed in the equaliser and Madrid went on to win.Ramos was, by his own admission, close to joining Manchester United in the summer of 2015. He had been at Madrid for 10 years, was attracted to something new and the relationship with the president was strained. No one represents Madrid quite like him and not only had he scored that goal to finally win the 10th European Cup, he had also scored twice in Munich in the semi-final in 2014. But, as the possibility of a move became clear, some powerful voices turned on him and he asked to go.Madrid would not let it happen. Casillas had just departed – badly. Had he not gone, United’s chances may have been increased, but Florentino Pérez would not allow both to depart. When Ramos and Pérez emerged from a tense meeting in China that went on for hours, just the two of them alone, accusations made, the decision had been taken: he was staying. It has worked out rather well.Despite all that, despite a decade at the club, there was some concern over the fans’ response, which was one of the reasons there had never been a public rebellion. But he overcame that and fast. Ramos was made the club captain and by the end of the season he was lifting the European Cup, having scored the opening goal in the final against Atlético. A year after that, he lifted it again. On Saturday night may be the third time. Add 2014 to that and it is four finals in five years.In SR4 there’s a line that runs: “MVP of the Champions League, another big-ears for Chamartín.” At the end of this month’s semi-final against Bayern, the fear finally flushed from their bodies, Ramos, who had spent the previous hour throwing himself in front of everyone and everything, went to the fans at the south end, climbed in among them, took the mic and sang. “Kings of Europe! We’re kings of Europe!” There was also a rendition of “How could I not love you, if you won the European Cup a 12th time?”Oh, they love him, all right. How could they not? The outrageous outfits, the occasional daftness, far more tongue-in-cheek than some seem to realise, the dark arts, do not change that they only deepen the admiration. He joined them at 19 and is 32 now, the only current player who had Zinedine Zidane as a team-mate.There may be doubts at times – Ancelotti was tearing his hair out in that first autumn – but when the big moments arise he is always there and they may never have had a leader like him no one has led them through an era like this. “He symbolises the values of Madrid,” Zidane says.“It all started with you,” one line of the rap runs with him wearing the armband seasons have a familiar ending. There is a basic and pretty stunning fact: as captain of Real Madrid, Sergio Ramos has never not won the trophy that defines the biggest club of all.No one has lifted this trophy three times at Madrid. Only Paco Gento captained Madrid three times in a final and he lost two of those, in 1962 and 1964. Miguel Muñoz was twice a European Cup-winning captain as was Manolo Sanchís, in 1998 and 2000. No one has played more Real Madrid games than Raúl or Casillas: Raúl never lifted it and Casillas won it once, in 2014. The player with the fourth-most appearances, Santillana, was captain when they lost the 1981 final to Liverpool in fifth, Fernando Hierro has won it as captain once. Ramos is set to overtake them all.Nor is it just going up to collect this cup. It is no coincidence that this has happened under Ramos. He is a captain in the most cliched sense: direct, firm, open, driven to lead the collective. By his own admission the pressure at Madrid is special, a place where the hits you take are real, where “every ‘lesson’ here is three elsewhere”.He says: “I have been here a long time, I know what it means to have this badge on your chest.” But perhaps that is the way he likes it, just as he embraced the switch to centre-back, because of the “hierarchy”, the “status”, the responsibility. The armband was an adornment that reinforced his character: “I was like that anyway.”“The key to this team is the commitment of the leaders, Ramos and Ronaldo,” says Sanchís, himself the son of a European Cup winner with Madrid. “Ramos is the standard-bearer of this generation.”Only two players played more games for Madrid than Sanchís junior. No one at Madrid has lifted the European Cup more times. Until now, perhaps. “Sergio says he is taking the record off me and I’m delighted,” Sanchís says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb986e5bfaca0a78bc839d761981b22f633fbe80/0_69_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=411bfcbfab0041613146fd6b0b26261a","title":"martin parr day at the chelsea flower show a photo essay","story":"Magnum photographer Martin Parr captures his unique view of gardening fans at the annual extravaganzaby  Martin Parr and  Maev KennedyMagnum photographer Martin Parr captures his unique view of gardening fans at the annual extravaganzaby  Martin Parr and  Maev KennedyJust one woman at Chelsea, peering through a thicket of foxgloves with a wry smile on her face, has clocked the quiet man in the brown shirt, owner of the most famously satirical eye in British photography. Martin Parr, she has realised, has invaded one of the most prestigious flower shows in the world.“It does happen that somebody recognises me, but not often – and certainly not at Chelsea,” Parr says. “It happens if I go to London openings, but these people on the whole don’t go to exhibitions, they just like plants, they only go to gardens.“I’m always interested in people and Chelsea is heaving with a certain type: rock-solid middle England, middle-aged, middle-class, grey hair, grey pound – still a very important part of the constituency. It’s as white as it gets: I think the only ethnic minority people I met were stewarding or working in the shops.”Anyone who does recognise Parr might worry they are about to be gently mocked in searing colour, like his scorched ice-cream eaters on pebbly beaches, or his silent couples perched glumly at cafe tables.He can barely tell a dandelion from an orchid, but he loves Chelsea, where every hat bears more flowers than any show garden, every recklessly patterned shirt is stretched over a post-prandial stomach.“Oh, I do love Chelsea,” he says. “I love anywhere where there are people. That’s my only dread, that there won’t be enough people, and you don’t have to worry about that at Chelsea. The only problem is that there are just so many of them, you have to fight your way through the crowds.”Parr has been accused in the past of artificially tweaking the colours in his images: “Another urban myth about me, not true.” But that’s not a problem at Chelsea – it bursts with colour.Having captured a man in crimson trousers intently studying some Wedgwood china that matches his floral shirt, Parr positions himself by a violently pink rose.“I thought it would be fun to do a sequence of people smelling the same rose, and I knew this was the one. It had the maximum smell in appearance and the minimum in results – that accounts for the expression of disappointment on so many of the faces.”Many people have given up even pretending to enjoy themselves. He snaps one bench entirely occupied by weary figures who have been left minding the shopping.Few men feature in his Chelsea images. Parr spends the next day at the cricket, realising where all the men have gone. “These are two perfectly matched events – exactly the same types, but the men are at Lords and the women are at Chelsea. Two sides of the same coin.”He is going back to Chelsea for the last day, when the temporary gardens are dismantled and sold. “Mobs of people staggering out trying to carry plants bigger than themselves – that’s what I’m hoping to see. Lovely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d6c078b886138b61ac0c59b610a9605f740997a/49_25_5266_3160/master/5266.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=171bd8777848faee31afeb630589a09a","title":"a letter to my slob partner","story":"‘There are some quite basic things you could do, such as replacing your revolting pants’: the letter you always wanted to writeI know you think there should be more sex in this relationship, and I know you think it’s my fault. But you must realise that nobody is obliged to have sex if they don’t want to, even if they are in a long-term relationship. I never signed up to anything or made any promises to you. I can exercise my own free will about what I do with my body, just as I can about what I eat and how I spend my spare time.Instead of focusing on me, therefore, I think a positive move for you would be to consider your own level of sexual appeal and how it can be enhanced. Although men tend not to obsess about their physical appearance in the way women are encouraged to, maybe you should have a think about it. Nobody wants to get into body-shaming but there are some quite basic things you could do, such as getting a haircut that doesn’t look as if it was done with a knife and fork, and buying jeans that fit so as to minimise the appearance of the builder’s arse whenever you bend down. Most of your pants are pretty revolting, too: new pants are not expensive.There is also your behaviour. Never offering someone any help, support, kind deeds, compliments or affection is all very well, but I really think it is only polite that that should be extended to never offering them sexual opportunities either, by which I mean slyly pawing or pressing against them in bed. If you want the sex, then start by doing the other stuff.Finally, I think you should consider the potential aphrodisiac properties of being less messy and performing simple everyday household tasks, so I don’t have to. Put the dishwasher on. Clean the worktops. Refrain from flicking teabags into the bin so I don’t have to repaint the kitchen wall every six months. As someone once said, it’s hard to shout at a man when he’s vacuuming. And on the flip side, it’s hard to find a man attractive when you have washed his undies and scrubbed the loo and carried out all those other acts of drudgery. There is a possibility that doing all this will render you tired and resentful enough to put you off sex, too let me say that I am willing to take that risk.It is quite possible that you will do all of these things and I will still give you the cold shoulder. But at least then you can say you have tried, and if it does happen then I will happily take the blame and wear the mantle of “frigid bitch” with pride.• We will pay £25 for every letter we publish.

It was never clear exactly how it could make you lose weight, but “longer” and “tauter” sounded a lot like “thinner”. Dancers did it because it was one of the only things you could do with a ton of historic injuries those of us who had never done enough exercise to amass any injuries did it because dancers did.Reformer pilates is a little more recent, as a craze, a lot more involved, in terms of hardware, and a lot more expensive. (The class I went to, in Clapham, south London, was £21 for an hour, which would make me think twice. Or maybe I’m just tight.)The hardware is a sprung bench (no giant beach ball here). You lie on it, there are straps you can put your legs in, straps you can put your arms in, and five springs of varying strength, which determine the difficulty of each exercise. Its peculiar design enables you to\u0026nbspdo things you wouldn’t – without leg straps, a movable bench and some spring – be able\u0026nbspto do, like a shoulder stand. There’s one piece\u0026nbspof equipment with a frame over the top, in which you can get practically upside down and feel like an acrobat. It’s important to remember that your human strength hasn’t changed, and no\u0026nbspself-respecting circus would employ you.I went with two friends, though luckily they were behind me, so I didn’t have to measure my failings against their success. You start off like a ballerina in stirrups, pointing your toes and flexing your legs towards different parts of the room. The instructor had a very evolved sense of direction, in which – so far as I could make out – she was alone. “Legs towards the high street! Shoulders up, legs towards the south wall.” Horizontal, and trying to move multiple limbs at once, I can just about remember which way is up. The concept of north is a world away. We were basically just watching each other and copying whoever seemed the most certain. It is all very hard on the muscles: controlled, sustained anything, if you keep at it for six minutes, will kill your hamstrings or anything else involved.About halfway through, the standing-on-the-bench commences, which seems as if it will be easier, because it looks it. One foot on the static part of the bench, one on the moving part, you slide your working foot in and out like a\u0026nbspcharacter in an 80s computer game of warrior bearing but limited skills. It turns out who knew? – that this is hard, too.The “reformer” element adds complexity and unexpectedness, which makes the time go faster but doesn’t make it feel any easier. I had the vague expectation of a mindfulness component, mainly because the kind of people who like pilates also like yoga. But this is not an activity in which you can drift off and connect with the true you. It requires the same level of concentration as driving on a motorway at the same time as having an argument which is in itself is quite mentally cleansing.

But at least three young Brits have lost their lives, as Rupert Neate reportsIf Dirk Zimmerman’s boss fancies a fresh tomato salad, the 35-year-old German hangs up his chef’s apron, dons a headset and takes to the skies. Zimmerman, who has been working on superyachts for more than a decade, has lost count of the number of times he’s been sent out on a ship’s helicopter or seaplane to source food, from courgettes in Oman to truffles in Argentina or vine tomatoes from a nearby Pacific atoll.“It might shock you to know how much money some people spend privately,” he says as he prepares sushi in the professional-grade kitchen on the 60-metre St David, moored in Monaco. “But to be able to take a helicopter and fly two hours somewhere to get the boss’s preferences makes his day.”As the rich become even richer – 145 more dollar billionaires were minted last year – orders for new superyachts (longer than 24 metres) have hit a record high. More than 500 are being built in shipyards around the world, and with many requiring at least 100 staff, superyachts now employ more than 37,000 people. Britain’s seafaring history has made it the biggest source of employees crewing on a superyacht is so popular among young adventurers that Southampton Solent University now offers degree-level training at its Warsash Superyacht Academy. Every spring, dozens of young Brits decamp to Antibes on the Côte d’Azur, the unofficial centre for superyacht crew recruitment, where you can wander along the docks looking for opportunities.While it is a dream job for some, other deckhands and chefs have horror stories of working punishing hours. Accidents, injuries and deaths are also commonplace, with union leaders believing working on superyachts to be more dangerous than life on oil rigs over the past few years at least three young Brits have died while serving their billionaire bosses. Because many superyachts continually float around the world (this is marketed to some as a way to avoid being registered in any country and hence to avoid paying tax), their crews may not be afforded the same legal protections as those on land. Families complain about a lack of assistance and sympathy from owners and those in charge of the vessel. None of the owners attended the three British men’s funerals.Michael Hanlon, 22, left Cumbria for his dream job as a deckhand and watersports instructor on 62-metre superyacht Faith, owned by the Canadian fashion billionaire Lawrence Stroll, in March 2013. Less than a month later, and before he’d had a chance to spend any of his first $3,500 (£2,600) monthly pay cheque, he was dead.Michael, known as Milo to his friends and family, had returned exhausted from a night out to the vessel docked in Antibes on the French Riviera. He had done two shifts back to back, working night and day, then gone to local bars to celebrate sailing across the Atlantic. Faith had been locked up for the night, and Michael climbed to its top in an attempt to get inside via an unofficial emergency entrance. An inquest found he fell from the top deck, hit his head on the quay and drowned. His body was recovered the next day.Jacob Nichol, from Cornwall, died last summer, aged 24, two years after he suffered severe brain injuries after falling from superyacht Kibo, while cleaning it as it was docked in a Majorcan port. Jacob, the yacht’s third assistant engineer, had been hanging in a harness when he fell and fractured his skull. His sister, Jenade Moon, said he had never been asked to clean the boat before: his job focused on engine maintenance. The owner of the £90m yacht, Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut – until last month owner of Waterstones, and friend of Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich – was not on board at the time.After 10 days in a coma in a hospital in Palma, Jacob was repatriated to Shropshire, where he needed constant care. In September an inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death. “Our beautiful Jacob has sadly passed away,” his family said. “A young, bright, intelligent, kind soul has left us after an excruciating two years.”In 2010, Robin Black received a call from the captain of the £15m sailing superyacht Burrasca, on which Black’s son Will was bosun, or officer in charge of crew and equipment. At the time, it was moored at the Monaco yacht show in Port Hercules, the annual beauty parade held in the industry’s global hub. The captain told Black that Will, 28, hadn’t been seen since the night before, when the rib he was piloting (a small boat used to ferry passengers to and from the yacht) collided with another boat. He thought Will may have been knocked overboard.By the time Robin, Will’s mother Judith and his sister Rosanna, now 37, arrived in Monaco to join the search, the yacht had left. “The captain said: ‘Don’t worry, we threw some flowers over the side and gave his belongings to the police,’” Rosanna says, fighting back tears as she describes “the worst days of our lives”. “I couldn’t comprehend that the boat had gone before Will was found and before we got there,” she says. “How could they just leave a family to deal with the death of one of their crew, and the police and paperwork and everything? I can’t believe that if something goes wrong – if someone dies – they can just raise the anchor and leave.”The family don’t know who owns Burrasca, though he is thought to have been a Russian billionaire (owners do not have to declare themselves). He was not on board at the time of the accident. The yacht did not request ers to look for Will’s body, leaving the captain of another superyacht, who was a friend, to pay for search and recovery ers. But they were unable to find Will, who had not been wearing a life vest.Will’s life was not insured. “But it’s not about money,” Rosanna says, “it’s about respect for another life.” She says that the owner didn’t and doesn’t seem to have cared. A spokesman for the yacht’s management did not respond to the ’s requests for comment.If something goes wrong on a superyacht, it can be incredibly difficult for crew and their families to understand which laws and rights apply. Vessels are often operating in international waters, their day-to-day operations run by management companies on behalf of often unidentifiable owners their yachts are registered via offshore companies in places such as Panama or the British Virgin Islands.To add to the confusion, superyachts can be registered with another country and fly their flag, even if the yacht is not based there. At the time of Will’s death, Burrasca was registered in St Vincent and the Grenadines. There was no British inquest, and local authorities recorded this report of the accident: “Mr William Black was on tender duty between the mothership at anchor and the shore. The anchorage was very crowded. Returning to the mothership, the tender hit an unattended vessel that was anchored in the bay. The tender was found drifting with no one on board… Mr Black’s body was not found.”Will, who had always wanted a life of adventure, had worked his way up from a deckhand on smaller boats to an officer on Burrasca. He’d recently begun his role as bosun on the 55.7-metre yacht and Rosanna says he was passionate about his job. “Will had found his calling. He worked hard, but he played hard, too, and always came back with the most amazing stories,” she says as she shows me photos of Will on a night out with 50 Cent and Jamiroquai. “We still get letters from some of the families he worked for. They send cards for Uncle Whale, as he was called,” she says. “He had a huge personality and everyone loved him.”Despite the circumstances of his death, Rosanna says she would not discourage others from joining the superyachting world. “I would just tell them to make sure they’re always on top of safety, and to find out who the owner is before they join.”It’s shorts, T-shirts and deck shoes weather at the Monaco yacht show, as I weave my way through champagne receptions, passing Ferraris and Aston Martins for sale on the quayside. This year’s display of yachts is collectively worth more than £2bn the combined annual spending on the world’s 6,281 superyachts could wipe out all developing countries’ debts.There are so many superyachts docked for the show that Top Shop boss Sir Philip Green’s £100m Lionheart has been forced out of its mooring into the Bay of Monaco. The 110-metre Jubilee, which was built for the late emir of Qatar, is on sale for $300m.On board the six-cabin St David, which is on sale for just under £20m, Zimmerman is preparing canapes for a party. He says the industry keeps many people in well-paid employment, adding that he can’t envisage going back to work on land, as “the pay cannot compare. I have three children, and working here pays for their education.” But, he adds, newbies have to decide early on whether they can sit by and watch their billionaire bosses spend vast amounts enjoying themselves, while appearing not to care about those around them. “It’s a compromise that everyone has to make – can you accept it?”Liz Brasler, 29, is chief mate, or second-in-command, of one of the yachts in the harbour. She won’t say which but “it’s one of the bigger ones”. She has worked her way up the ranks from deckhand since 2006. “It can be great fun but it’s also exhausting, delivering the highest standards invisibly, magically, with no apparent fuss,” she says. “Owners expect the best in the world. They want to go wherever, whenever, and demand the highest standards without delay. Money is not a problem for them.”For most of her career, Brasler, who is South African, bunked with colleagues in small cabins now she has a cabin of her own. But while she has more privacy, she says she can’t remember the last time she had seven hours’ sleep while on charter or at sea.The billionaires’ superyacht designer of choice, Andrew Winch, knows all about the needs of the super-rich. We speak on Cloud 9, the 74-metre, £59m yacht he designed for the Australian retail tycoon Brett Blundy this is the first time he has stepped aboard since he handed it over. Winch, who has designed yachts in a London studio since 1986, created Madame Gu, the 2014 motor yacht of the year, and Phoenix 2, owned by the late Polish billionaire Jan Kulczyk. His yacht designs have proved so popular that he now designs clients’ homes and planes, including Roman Abramovich’s Boeing 767.“Most clients will have three, four or five houses around the world,” he says. “We have clients we’ve already worked with on their jet and their yacht, and soon there will be a ‘rollover’ and we’ll start on another sequence.”Everything on board is designed for the owner, from the bedroom suites named after Star Wars characters (his favourite film), to the extra head space above the gym’s treadmill (he’s tall) and the proliferation of chess sets: “He likes to play chess, for several days, with various guests at the same time,” Winch says. In the hair salon, a wall folds down to create a balcony “because it’s very nice, when the sun’s setting in Greece, to have a massage outside”.A short ride downstairs in the ship’s glass-topped elevator is the “beach club” at the bow. From here Blundy and his guests can hit the water with the boat’s “toys”, including a speedboat for waterskiing, jetskis and what Winch calls a “James Bond-style personal submarine”. A “water sports and boys’ toys” instructor will be on hand to help guests get the hang of it and take care of “all the boring things”, like cleaning and clearing away. For guests who dislike the swell or salt of the ocean, there’s a swimming pool above an espresso bar.The ship’s teacher, one of 22 staff, is on hand to guide their learning. There’s also a nanny, personal trainer, masseuse and hairdresser. “You take your life with you,” Winch explains.“Life on board is perfect for owners – they receive a seven-star service. But for officers and crew it can be a lot more difficult,” says Danny McGowan, the strategic organiser of seafarers’ union, Nautilus International. He has come from their offices in London to the Monaco show to draw attention to the deaths of young workers, highlighting the dangers of working in an industry that to outsiders appears the height of glamour.“They will often be working very long hours, right around the clock, looking after guests,” says the fair-skinned, red-haired McGowan, sheltering from the sun in Monaco’s famous La Rascasse bar, which a crew recruitment company has hired out for the week. “These are tragic situations where young people have lost their lives, and there are hundreds of other injuries and complaints that aren’t reported.” He says staff have had their passports confiscated and wages withheld they talk of being sent home for the slightest uniform infraction.Superyacht owners can view crew as “dispensable and replaceable” and don’t consider the impact on their families. “Often an owner feels they can just get a new third engineer, rather than thinking of the consequences for the inidual,” he says. “We’re not here to be up against these billionaires. We want to work with them to make employment in this industry better.”Most recently, McGowan has been representing the 42-strong crew of a £67m superyacht owned by the Indian multimillionaire Vijay Mallya. The crew, among them several Britons, haven’t been paid for months, and are owed more than $1m. McGowan helped them take their case to court, to have the yacht impounded in Malta. Mallya, a co-owner of the Force India Formula One team, was arrested in London last year over allegations that he supported the team with laundered cash, and Indian authorities are currently seeking his extradition to face trial. He is living in a Hertfordshire mansion while on bail the yacht, which features a 15-seat cinema and Sir Elton John’s baby grand piano, remains impounded, with some of the crew still on board.Sitting on the harbour wall overlooking Cloud 9 and a fleet of other superyachts, Fiona Hanlon fights back tears as she remembers the “heartbreakingly impersonal” way she was informed of the death of her 22-year-old son, Michael.Hanlon has flown to Monaco from the family home in the Lake District to scatter Michael’s ashes. At the same time, knowing he had worked two shifts back to back, she is taking the opportunity to highlight the plight of some other superyacht crew, who she says are often forced to work long hours – conditions that might be illegal in the UK. “It was Michael’s dream job,” she says. He grew up sailing on Windermere. “He had just got his first salary and he’d sent me photographs of the sunglasses and travelling guitar he was going to buy. He was so excited, it was wonderful.”Michael had been texting his mother daily updates about his adventures sailing across the Atlantic. But on 7 April 2013, Fiona’s phone didn’t ping. She texted him: “Worried about you now – no contact gets me thinking something is wrong – say hello soon please x” followed by, “My baby where are you x x please get in touch angel – we just want to know you are OK.”The next day his mother was told Michael was missing. “It was seen as an inconvenience, as the boat was going on to pick up Catherine Zeta-Jones,” she says. The following day Michael’s body was found under the yacht by police ers.The coroner for Cumbria, Philip Sharp, ruled that he died from drowning and recorded a verdict of accidental death. He wrote to the yacht’s registered owner – a PO box in the British Virgin Islands – to raise concerns that “crew members and in this case the deceased were likely to have been asked to work additional shifts when the boat came in to port, potentially causing tiredness”. Sharp’s letter required the yacht’s owner to provide all crew with a key to the boat, and to ensure the captain check the crew are not required to work excessive hours.An unnamed director of the superyacht’s owner, Pluteus Limited (a company based in Monaco, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and registered in the Cayman Islands), wrote to the coroner to say: “We are keen to cooperate and address the concerns you have identified as a result of the inquest. However, please note that in doing so, no acknowledgment or admission of failings or liability is intended or to be inferred.”The director said that access to the yacht had been improved by the provision of keyless codes to all staff. It was also promised that working hours would be monitored, “to ensure crew members are not working additional hours without the requisite rest periods, in particular between shifts, unless the safety of the boat, crew and passengers is in danger”.Meanwhile, chief mate Liz Brasler is wondering what job she might do next. She says that while working on superyachts has been fun, it can be difficult, demoralising and sometimes dangerous. Friends have been injured and she knows of others who have died. “We’re insured, but it doesn’t cover everything. I know the price of my life,” she says. “And it’s less than my parents think.”• Commenting on this piece?

The company behind Stranger Things and The Crown must continue producing hits, poaching Hollywood talent and gaining subscribers at a rapid rate if it is to justify the faith of an investment community that pushed its valuation to nearly $162bn (£121bn) on Thursday – $10bn ahead of Disney.Netflix had reverted to second place by the close of trading but the trajectory is clear: the California-based business that started out as a DVD rental outfit in 1997 is putting Hollywood and conventional broadcast networks in the shade. It has 125 million subscribers worldwide – including more than 55 million in the US and more than 8 million in the UK – and this year the company is spending $8bn on content, including 700 original TV shows and 80 movies. This week, the company announced yet more of the high-end content deals that underpin its growth, signing up Barack and Michelle Obama to produce films and documentaries, and announcing a $150m blockbuster, Six Underground, starring Ryan Reynolds. The expenditure behind the casting coups and award-winning content, however, is significant. Netflix expects a negative free cash flow of between $3bn to $4bn this year – meaning the amount its spends on content, marketing and other costs in 2018 will exceed what it earns from subscribers by at least $3bn. It needs debt, and willing banks, to do this. Last month, Netflix raised almost $2bn in debt – its largest raise to date and the second time in less than a year it has turned to the debt market – to continue to feed film and TV content to the binge-watching generation it helped create.“They need to keep on borrowing as they are investing so much so quickly in content and have to stay ahead, there’s nothing else they can do,” Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders, says. “They have to stay ahead of Amazon and Apple, and soon Disney. They are at the moment but there are very well funded, larger, competitors starting to get their act together.”The Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, does not like to come second and showed his intent to take the fight to Netflix with an edict to find a Game of Thrones-style hit for its Prime Video service resulting in executives striking a $1bn deal to bring the Lord of the Rings to TV. So, too, Apple, which outbid even Netflix’s seemingly bottomless pockets for a TV series starring Reese Witherspoon, who on top of her Hollywood star premium commands astronomical fees after the success of HBO’s Emmy-winning Big Little Lies, and Jennifer Aniston.Disney has pulled its vast array of content – from Star Wars and Toy Story to Beauty and the Beast and the Marvel universe of superhero films – from Netflix before launching its own streaming service next year.In the global quest to win subscribers Netflix has sparked a content arms race that is becoming an increasing financial burden on the company.Netflix declares a small profit – net income was $290m in the first three months of 2018 – because it is able to spread the spiralling costs of making programmes over a number of years. However, the company has almost $30bn of debt and liabilities across its balance sheet.Netflix’s total streaming obligations, for making and licensing TV and film content, will cost $17bn over the next few years, while its long-term debt as of 31 March was $6.5bn. It also has $3bn to $5bn in costs it expects to pay relating to “traditional film output deals or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown”. Including the recent debt raising, the company’s total liabilities are around $30bn.However, Netflix’s practice of spreading the cost of programmes over a multi-year timeframe – an industry standard – is being questioned by some analysts who argue that the binge-watch nature of an on-demand world means the value of a programme or film expires much quicker than on traditional linear TV.Meanwhile, the content deals keep coming. It has an agreement with Shonda Rhimes, creator of hits including Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder a $300m deal with Ryan Murphy, whose credits include Glee, NipTuck and American Crime Story the Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman, and Jenji Kohan, who is behind Weeds and Orange is the New Black. All of these cost a lot of money and are driving inflation in Netflix’s content costs.Netflix is adamant it can continue growing at a healthy rate. Its backers argue: 700m broadband and pay-TV homes around the world (excluding China) have yet to take up a subscription Disney and its ESPN sport unit happily shoulder sport programming commitments of $50bn and the S\u0026ampP credit rating service has put the company’s debt, which carries the riskier junk status, on a positive watch.The question is, can Netflix add enough new subscribers – and hopefully raise subscription costs – to keep up its increasingly costly spend on content, and service its debt.“Providing Netflix’s growth on subscribers and revenues remains at the same trajectory it is sustainable,” Broughton says. “Netflix has been adept at increasing pricing without losing subscribers but that is going to be difficult in its new growth markets like Asia and Africa, where there are cheaper competitors already. This year could be when Netflix starts to see slower growth. If the growth slows they are in trouble.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d08499cf0bb5d1a94fa3224f42443f8cc34bf89c/0_0_5426_3394/master/5426.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=532f495610bd02050110657c951e6354 700w","title":"majority of eu27 favour simple approach on britons residency","story":"Only about 10 countries likely to use system similar to that planned by UK for EU nationalsA majority of the EU27 do not plan to force UK nationals living within their borders to apply for a special residency status after Brexit, in contrast to the UK government’s treatment of EU nationals.An initial meeting of officials and diplomats in Brussels on the treatment of UK nationals post-Brexit found a mood in favour of a “smooth and simple” approach.Governments across Europe have different approaches to dealing with foreign EU nationals who move to live in their country, with some encouraging or demanding registration.Many in the meeting on Friday expressed the view that imposing an additional mandatory system on British nationals in their country would prove an unnecessary complication and expense.Britons who move to EU countries before the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December 2020 will be granted rights similar to those available today, although with some gaps, including the right to onward movement between member states.The UK has opted to set up a new system for resident EU nationals, under which applicants will be charged £72 each. The former home secretary Amber Rudd vowed it would be as simple as setting up a shopping account with the high-end retailer LK Bennett.It subsequently emerged that the app for the system would not work on iPhones, a brand used by more than half of the adult population in the UK.Ingrid Taylor, 61, a translator who has lived in Germany for 30 years and who is a member of the lobby group British in Europe, said her fellow Britons abroad were keen to avoid unnecessary paperwork.“We need some kind of document to show that we have rights but it should be a declaratory system, not a long application that people have to fill out,” she said. “That will bring all sorts of problems and pitfalls, as we have seen with the 85-page permanent residence application form in the UK.”Of the 27 member states represented in the meeting in Brussels on Friday, about 10 were minded to establish a system similar to the UK’s with 17 were opposed, according to EU sources.Of those with the most UK nationals, Spain said it was undecided and representatives for France did not share their thoughts. Germany said it was undecided but was leaning towards an obligatory system for Britons, in order for the government to be able to recognise people conferred with rights under the withdrawal agreement and those not.The European commission proposed a uniform set of identification documents to be made available for UK nationals who make their home in the EU before the end of the transition period. A follow-up meeting on the issue is expected in September.

The vouchers are available to any woman who receives benefits such as income support or jobseeker’s allowance, or who lives in a home where someone does.The vouchers were brought in UK-wide in 2006 by Labour in an effort to improve the diets of poorer families and narrow the nutritional gap between rich and poor. Specialist children’s doctors and public health experts have praised the scheme for playing a key role in tackling obesity and ensuring low-income families can access healthy foods that some may otherwise struggle to afford.The Labour MP Frank Field, a former welfare minister and veteran anti-poverty campaigner, who obtained the take-up figures through parliamentary questions, said: “Healthy Start vouchers have quietly developed into a key weapon in our armoury to defeat malnutrition. They radically improve poorer families’ diets by increasing their consumption of fruit and vegetables as well as vitamin intake, while simultaneously reducing the pressure on their weekly budgets.“As things stand, too many of the most disadvantaged families remain exposed to malnutrition because they are not registered for the scheme.”Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the low take-up was worrying given rising obesity.“Eating well early in life is key to ensuring good eating habits last into adulthood,” he said. “We know that children living in the UK’s poorest households are more likely to be overweight and have poor nutrition, which is why this scheme is vital. “The low uptake is particularly concerning as this week a commitment to deliver the Healthy Start vouchers appears to have been dropped as a priority from the Department for Health and Social Care’s business plan.”Failure to register could be linked to not knowing the vouchers exist, the system’s complexity, and stigma of exchanging them for food, he said. “My plea to the prime minister is to take all necessary steps towards securing full take-up, perhaps by initiating a policy of automatic registration which overcomes issues around stigma and complexity,” Field said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “The Healthy Start scheme provides vital assistance to help children from lower income families access free fruit, vegetables, milk and vitamins.“While participating is a personal choice for eligible families, we publicise it widely to encourage uptake. It is also promoted at a local level through midwives and healthcare professionals, and we are exploring how digital technology could make it easier to receive Healthy Start benefits in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c4c63ef54e9f831af540cbb774bf8a2afe85f9/708_881_4504_2703/master/4504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0906ab051d1c01e6742de0cad3798dee","title":"chris froome solo pink jersey giro ditalia stage for the ages cycling","story":"• Remarkable breakaway catapults Briton to the front• Simon Yates falls out of contention amid stage dramaOn one of the most extraordinary days in Giro d’Italia history Chris Froome produced a performance that ripped the breath away, obliterating his rivals with a solo 80km escape to seize the maglia rosa with two stages remaining.It was remarkable to watch, especially up close. For not only did Froome defy a series of brutal climbs and temperatures that climbed into the 80s but he continued to take massive chunks of time out of the overnight leader, Simon Yates, and then Tom Dumoulin during a breakaway that began on the Colle Delle Finestre and lasted more than two hours.“It was going to take something really special to get rid of Simon and to get away from Dumoulin,” admitted Froome. “I wasn’t going to go from fourth to first on the last climb alone, so I had to do it from far out and Colle Delle Finestre was the perfect place to do it. The gravel road reminds me of riding in Africa and I just felt good and thought, ‘It is now or never.’”Yet cycling’s charred history inevitably means that “something really special” will, rightly or wrongly, be accompanied by suspicion. And Froome, remember, is riding under a cloud as he fights to clear his name having failed a drugs test for salbutamol in September, as first revealed by the .Many – including David Lappartient, the president of UCI, cycling’s world governing body – also believe Sky should have withdrawn the 33-year-old until his case was resolved. However, Froome insists he has done nothing wrong and continues to fight to clear his name.”I know I have done nothing wrong and soon that will be clear to everyone,” Froome said. “There will always be one comment or another but the fans in Italy have been great, so grazie mille.”For now, though, his sole focus is on becoming the first man since Bernard Hinault in 1982-83 – and only the third in history after Hinault and Eddy Merckx – to hold all three grand tours, the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and the Giro, at the same time. Given his astonishing performance, which quickly erased a 3min 22sec deficit over Yates and then put him 40 seconds clear of his nearest challenger, Dumoulin, that looks a certainty.Before Friday’s 19th stage from Venaria Reale to Bardonecchia everyone knew that Froome would attack on the Finestre, the Cima Coppi of this year’s Giro, with its 45 hairpin bends along a summit 2,178m high. No one, though, expected the attack to be so frenzied or so sustained.Before the start Yates’s directeur sportif at Michelton-Scott, Matt Scott, had punchily dismissed suggestions that his man was spent – or that Froome was a threat to the maglia rosa.” If it happens it will be on the Finestre,” he conceded. “But we’re ready for it.”Yet his best-laid plans soon turned to dust as Yates cracked early and began to ride with all the uncertainty of a club rider on his first hors catégorie climb. For two weeks the 25-year-old from Bury had worn the pink jersey with distinction. Now he had to suffer the ignominy of finishing 38 minutes back.Froome, however, was merely getting started. A sustained attack with 80km remaining instantly left the rest of the field gasping and by the summit of the Finestre, he had already opened a gap of 42 seconds to a group of four riders headed by Dumoulin.“We took the decision on Thursday night to ride in this way,” saidFroome. “I know the roads like the back of my hand so it made it a lot easier. It was a big risk to attack so far from the finish but it was a well-calculated risk. The team were fantastic, they made a really strong pace at the Colle Delle Finestre to make the pace for me to go. This is what bike racing is all about.”At the summit Froome passed a man in an inhaler suit – a reference to his failed salbutamol test – but he still wanted more. And he found it on a thrilling descent. At times his riding looked reckless and at one stage a motorcycle had to brake suddenly to avoid knocking him off his bike but it was hugely effective.By the time Froome began his climb up the Sestriere, an ascent famous for Lance Armstrong breaking away from the bunch in the 1999 Tour de France, Froome’s lead had extended to one minute and 52 seconds.Try as he might, Dumoulin was unable to respond and by the time Froome passed the “40km to go” sign, he was virtual race leader – although there was nearly disaster when he had to swerve past a crashed motorbike. That, however, was only a minor hiccup and Froome continued to power up to the finish at Bardonecchia.Now with only Saturday’s 214km stage from Susa to Cervinia facing him before reaching Rome on Sunday, Froome stands on the verge of an astonishing victory – and he clearly has no plans to falter now.“We are not going to celebrate just yet,” he said. “But we can see how quickly things can change here. I gave it everything but I tried to stay within my limits so hopefully we can finish this off tomorrow.”Yates was mystified at his performance: “At the start there was no signs of anything wrong. I was just tired, extremely exhausted and that’s bike riding unfortunately. I tried to manage (the gap) but I really had nothing to give.“I gave everything today,” he added. “It’s just how it is. But I’ll be back. It obviously hurts, but I have said all along that this is how I needed to ride this Giro to try to win it and if I achieved nothing more I can still be happy. And I will be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddabdb74b812ed6c3ff2c4b6c90a6a8a61fe051c/0_99_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dd21050ad3ea78ab9d669c387771b07","title":"rugby union premiership final saracens exeter schalk brits","story":"The ‘Peter Pan’ of north London rugby is planning to celebrate whatever the result of Saturday’s Premiership final against Exeter at TwickenhamSchalk Brits will be celebrating win, lose or draw after Saturday’s Premiership final. The South African hooker brings the curtain down on nine remarkable years with Saracens after yet another final, before beginning another career in finance, starting with a masters degree at Oxford.He admits the doubts of whether he may have a bit more rugby left in him have been surfacing more than usual of late – at the start of the season he was described as “Peter Pan” by his director of rugby – but it is not a decision the 37-year-old seems to regret.Just this week there was another offer from a different club but his final outing at Twickenham provides him with the chance to sign off with a fairytale ending. It is the measure of the man, however, that he will not let his season, or his career, be defined by one match. “It’s never been part of our makeup, we don’t focus on winning, we try to make memories,” he said. “It would be nice to finish on a high note, but if we don’t, as long as we try our best we’ll still celebrate a great season with great memories.”Brits, despite his still remarkable form, continuing to redefine the limits of what a hooker is capable of with ball in hand, gives the impression that matches on a weekend are secondary to what he wants to take out of rugby. Asked what his best memories from his time in north London are, it is not European or Premiership finals that spring to mind. Rather the notorious team-bonding trips undertaken by Saracens to far-flung places such as Bermuda, Barcelona, the Alps or Oktoberfest.Brits has been named on the bench against Exeter but he is sure to play a key role – Mark McCall would be crazy not to introduce him as the game breaks up in the second half, not least considering how he performed at Twickenham on the opening weekend of the season against Northampton. It is Jamie George who gets the nod at hooker though, and he has questioned whether Exeter will feel the strain of arriving as the defending champions. Exeter contest their third straight final at Twickenham, having struggled in their first, two years ago against Saracens, going down 28-20. Having beaten Wasps last year, however, they are a different animal but George believes they could find being champions rather than challengers a trickier proposition. “Exeter might feel a little bit more pressure, we’ve wanted to have a shot at Exeter in one of these big games since last season so it’s nice to be given the opportunity,” said George.McCall is boosted by being able to name an unchanged starting XV from the side that defeated Wasps 57-33 – which means Billy Vunipola starts at No8 – but he acknowledges his side must improve defensively if they are to get their hands back on the trophy. “It is obviously something we were not happy about,” he said. “But we also think it is something we can correct and fix. We are a good defensive team, we all know that, but something like that happening the week before the final and getting away with it is probably not a bad thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a6a92193a0e2780b23bf58ddf7c23abbb3cdcae/12_74_4865_2919/master/4865.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bc831ef0efdad3581b7ed00ef051885","title":"talking horses battaash can burn off rivals temple stakes haydock horse racing tips","story":"There are a few things for odds-on gamblers to worry about as Battaash (4.00) returns to the track in Saturday’s Temple Stakes at Haydock. Personally, if I’m going to back something at 8-11 or similar, I prefer to know that this race is the big day.No such comfort is available because the Haydock contest is a reappearance run, intended to get the freshness out of this zippy sort before Royal Ascot. He is giving weight to all his rivals and is partnered by the owner’s second jockey because the No\u0026nbsp1 has gone to Ireland for the day. All the same the credentials of this Prix de l’Abbaye winner are hard to fault. He is easily the most likely winner and I would rather be with him than against him, even at such short odds.1.55 Goodwood Second time out has been the right time to catch First Sitting in his three seasons since coming over from Ireland and it may be the same story after his reappearance sixth in the Gordon Richards Stakes. Chris Wall’s veteran bounced back from a similar effort in the same prep race to take this prize last year by a nose from Spark Plug. The pair look well placed to fight out the finish again.2.15 Haydock The run was surely needed when The Grand Visir dropped out in the closing stages at Newmarket three weeks ago. Better is expected for this step up in trip, with the cheekpieces he wore for most of last season now refitted.2.30 Goodwood William Haggas’s Society Power, having won his last four by a sum of about two lengths, has been hard for the handicapper to wrestle into submission. The three-year-old is up another 6lb for his Ascot win last time but looked as if he had more to give that day. Stall two is a good draw as long as connections do not insist on holding him up, at the back as they did in a smaller field on a straight course last time.2.50 Haydock Having won the Silver Bowl twice in the past five years, Mark Johnston has another live chance with Ventura Knight. The winner of three in a row last summer, he battled well to score at Doncaster last weekend and should be competitive again. The back-to-form champion jockey, Silvestre de Sousa, takes the ride.3.05 York Lightly raced since 2016, when coming within a neck of winning a Group Two, Do Re Mi Fa Sol has joined Francis Graffard for this season and improved on her first run when second in a Listed race at Longchamp. She is up to winning this if at her best and may be underestimated in the betting, as French raiders sometimes are here.3.25 Haydock A line is easily put through the only moderate runs on the résumé of Sands Of Mali, since they came in the Middle Park and at the Breeders’ Cup at the end of last year. He won a French Group Three on his reappearance last month and is easily up to scoring in this class, having landed the Gimcrack last year.3.40 York Having come up short by less than a length in a similar race here nine days ago, Carlton Frankie could be worth another chance. Her best form last year was in her first couple of runs.4.10 Curragh To be shown in Britain on At The Races, this Irish 2,000 Guineas has a British-trained favourite in Elarqam, despite there having been only one British winner in the past seven runnings. Elarqam would need to settle a lot better than he did in the Newmarket version and a better bet may be the 3-1 about U S Navy Flag. Last year’s Dewhurst Stakes winner has excuses for his two defeats this year and things should work out better for him here on the drying ground."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c97a2edbdf694faf63db6feef62be47640e055a9/0_57_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ce6da030871d02e8ae99ec903fd228f","title":"england v pakistan first test day three live","story":"We’re obvously behind in the game. It’s down to us to get this last wicket and then put on a good show with the bat. If we can match what Pakistan get in this innings, it gives us something to bowl at. Potentially in hindsight yes but I also think we didn’t do ourselves justice with the bat. Again with the ball, I think we bowled pretty well yesterday and on another day I think we could have bowled them out much cheaper.He’s then asked about England bowling the wrong length, and his statistically better performance from the Nursery End:Yesterday I didn’t think the ball did as much as the first day. We want to bowl that fuller length and find that edge, it depends on the batsman you bowl at. We talk a lot about length, but if you’re not making the batsman play it doesn’t matter what length you bowl. I like bowling this end when the ball’s swinging. My grouping is a lot better from this end in terms of line.And then about Stokes taking the second new ball yesterday, and all those dropped catches:I didn’t feel in particularly great rhythm from this end. It’s just the way it goes. As a captain, you want your in-form bowlers to take the new ball and I was probably down the pecking order a bit yesterday.We met up on Monday, and we put so much work in on the catching, in the slips in particular. It’s frustrating, but they’re not doing it on purpose. We’ve got areas to improve and the catching is one of them. We’ve put in a lot of work trying to get that better.Weather watch: it has rained overnight in north London but currently it’s brighter than it was at any stage yesterday, and no further rain is forecast until this evening. So, we’re all set.So, day three. Pakistan lead by 166, with one first-innings wickets remaining, Babar Azam having been ruled out for the remainder of the series with a fractured forearm. England’s position in the match is bad, and the tourists have a chance to turn that to downright terrible in the first hour of the day. And then England have to bat, and they have to do it better than they did on day one.

Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2cecdc043738e91561632fa9822476a60421e7e/590_476_3037_1822/master/3037.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31bee2535774eecb862b5df2a269b61a","title":"chelsea clinton vitriol flung at me","story":"The former first daughter on privilege, female leadership, dealing with critics, and how Trump ‘degrades what it means to be American’When the American media describe Chelsea Clinton as royalty, they refer not to her popularity but to her ubiquity. Her very first home was the governor’s mansion in Little Rock, Arkansas the family home she left for university 18 years later was the White House. Ordinarily, it’s only young royals who grow up in lavish official residences and the pitiless media spotlight, a permanent presence in our consciousness. It is a uniquely strange and unenviable version of celebrity that stole Clinton’s anonymity before she was old enough to spell it.When we meet there is, therefore, a disconcerting sense of deja vu. Everything begins exactly as one might expect. On the previous day there had been the pre-interview call from one of her handlers, who was ostensibly warm and yet conveyed an impression of wary control, leaving me worried about how far I’d be allowed to stray from the subject of Clinton’s new book. The interview takes place at the Clinton Foundation, a vast but discreetly unadvertised expanse of midtown Manhattan office space populated by serious-looking people and elegantly adorned by African-inspired artwork chosen by Clinton’s father. Clinton is waiting in the glass boardroom the interview starts precisely on schedule, to the second.The 38-year-old displays impressive fluency in British current affairs, knowing all about the NHS’s missed mammogram test results, and praising David Lammy’s recent Windrush speech in the Commons. Her father once talked about the importance of really seeing people – the person who opens his car door, or pours his coffee – and I’m struck that Clinton notices the medical support sleeve I’m wearing, and asks about the origins of the name Decca. But any impression of intimacy is offset by a facial expression that remains glassily still, and a voice that never modulates. Clinton has inherited her mother’s unnerving composure, and speaks in monotone paragraphs consisting almost entirely of language no human being I know ever uses. “The choices that they made,” for example, “were fundamental to me feeling affirmed in charting my own journey”, which is not how anyone else talks about their mum and dad.Clinton has just published her third children’s book, and will be appearing at the Hay festival next weekend. She Persisted Around The World is a picture book in which she tells the stories of 13 extraordinary women through the ages, from Marie Curie to Malala Yousafzai, who persevered in the face of prejudice and changed history. It’s the sequel to her New York Times bestseller She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World, the title inspired by Republican senator Mitch McConnell’s scathing attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren for trying to read aloud a letter from Martin Luther King Jr’s widow in the senate. Warren was famously silenced, under an obscure senate rule that McConnell later defended with: “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,” only for his words to be swiftly converted into a feminist rallying cry.Clinton is completely right, of course. But later, listening back to my tape, I notice that when I say it feels important to me for my sons to know these stories, she responds with: “Thank you for framing it around both our daughters and our sons.” A few minutes later, when I tell her I took them to see Ava DuVernay’s A Wrinkle In Time, which features a geeky female protagonist who’s good at maths, Clinton replies: “I’m really grateful that you took your sons to see it.” Her odd construction of gratitude (most people would say, “Oh, well done,” or “That’s great!”) means that – even when we’re agreeing – it can feel hard to connect.She has talked in the past about inheriting her maternal grandmother’s “responsibility gene”, and mentions to me that her daughter’s nursery has been encouraging conversations about the concept of fairness. “It gives us the chance to talk with her about what is fair, and that she already has unfair advantages because of who her parents are. I don’t think she really understands the concept of privilege yet, but I want her to be able to understand that as soon as she’s old enough to. So we can start having larger conversations about privilege, and about the clear responsibility that comes with privilege. It’s also about kindness and respect.”My guess is that Clinton feels unable to say something as simple as “Oh, well done”, for fear of sounding superior. The unfortunate irony is that her thanks, intended to convey humility, end up making her seem either inauthentic or grand.It’s just a tiny glimpse into the lifelong impossibility of being Chelsea Clinton. At elementary school in Arkansas, her teacher called her precocious – “and it wasn’t meant as a compliment” – though her parents told her it was “a very good thing”. She’d begun reading newspapers when she was just four, “and my parents expected me to have an opinion about what I thought the most important stories were, and then to be able to muster an argument in support of what I thought was right or wrong. They taught me early on the difference between opinion and fact. A crucial distinction,” she adds dryly, “that seems to be not as appreciated at the moment by some, unfortunately.”Just 12 when she moved into the White House, an awkward adolescent jumble of frizzy hair and braces, Clinton was 18 when the father she idolised confessed to an affair with Monica Lewinsky. Two hundred and fifty journalists covered her arrival at Stanford University, where she was criticised for keeping a low profile, hidden away in her bulletproof dorm, but then criticised again for partying with celebrities when she moved to Oxford for an MPhil in international relations. She tried working for management consultants McKinsey, and then a hedge fund, but her heart wasn’t in it as she has said, “I tried to care about things like money. I just didn’t.”Following another master’s in public health she became a special correspondent for NBC, but was widely panned, one critic describing the decision to hire her as “journalistically bankrupt”. New York magazine ran the headline: “Chelsea Clinton at NBC: When Nepotism Goes Wrong”.The caution with which she parses my questions is therefore unsurprising. Now vice-chair of the family foundation, she seems to have found a public voice and role that fits, campaigning for girls’ empowerment, early access to childhood education and global healthcare initiatives – but even so, for the first half of the interview she sounds more like a policy paper than a real person.And then, quite unexpectedly, something changes. Feminist opinion is ided, I observe, between women who feel we should seize this #MeToo moment and go all out to tear down the patriarchy, and those who fear our rage will alienate support. Does Clinton still believe we should go high? She gazes at me in silence, as though making up her mind whether or not to become present, and when she opens her mouth it feels as if she is suddenly here.“For me, maybe because I’ve had so much vitriol flung at me for as long as I can literally remember, people saying awful things to me even as a child, I’ve never found it productive, personally, to engage in that way. To retaliate with crass language or insult someone personally – I just don’t think I’m built that way.”Does she tell herself they’re not really talking about her? “Oh, no,” she flashes back, with a low chuckle. “I know they’re talking about me. I just think that the way they’re talking about me, to me, to my face, online, is a reflection on them and not about me. The savagery that is directed at me, sometimes it’s because I’m just the person that they happen to see and recognise, and they’re angry, and so that anger kind of spills out. Sometimes they’re mad at me because of something that my mum or dad did, or something that my mum or dad never did – but they have been fed the narrative that they were trafficking children, or drugs, or some other heinous crime.”She used to believe the right thing to do about “all of the meanness” was simply ignore it, she reflects. “Now I’ve come to feel differently, because I think that the way that our president and many people around him have not only mainstreamed hate, but mainlined it, is so deeply dangerous.” Her eyes fill with dismay as she cites the rising reports of bullying in schools catalogued by the Southern Poverty Law Centre. “Not just the hundreds but now thousands of instances in schools across America, where children are citing the president as they’re demeaning a little girl, or they’re chanting ‘Build a wall’ in an attempt to demean and degrade brown children. So the reason, now, I no longer ignore it when people say hateful things to me on the street or on social media is, I think we have to shine a light. I think those of us who have platforms to do that have to say this is wrong and unacceptable, so we don’t normalise it but try to detoxify what has been unleashed. Because if we don’t, we leave a vacuum. And I think the darkness fills that vacuum.”I tell her a lot of people in Britain are wondering how they should receive Trump’s visit in July. What’s her advice? “Well, I’ve been to multiple protests since the election. Charlotte’s been to at least three, maybe four. Aidan’s been to one. If I lived in Britain I would show up to protest, because I don’t agree with what he’s doing to degrade what it means to be an American.”We are meeting two days after a smiling Ivanka Trump opened the US embassy in Jerusalem, as dozens of Palestinians were massacred. I ask if Clinton feels any sympathy for the first daughter, obliged to do her father’s grotesque bidding, or considers her complicit. Her expression hardens.“She’s an adult. She can make the choices for herself. I mean, she’s 36. We are responsible for our choices. In 2008 I was really proud to support my mum – but I disagreed with her fundamentally on a few things, particularly her then opposition to equal marriage rights for LGBTQ Americans. I never defended that position, because it wasn’t what I believed was the right thing to do.”Ivanka and Chelsea used to be friends, and seemed to have much in common: famous and powerful parents young families and busy jobs in Manhattan. In 2015 Clinton told American Vogue, “She’s always aware of everyone around her and ensuring that everyone is enjoying the moment. It’s an awareness that in some ways reminds me of my dad, and his ability to increase the joy of the room. There’s nothing skin-deep about Ivanka.” The friendship somehow survived the election campaign, but not Trump’s presidency the pair haven’t formally fallen out, but Clinton says they haven’t spoken in “a long time”.Were Ivanka to succeed her father in the White House, as some have speculated, would the election of the first female president still constitute a triumph for feminism? “Well, I didn’t support Sarah Palin when she was the vice-president nominee in 2008. And I hope my son is as much a feminist as my daughter. I think it is more about what we stand for, and how we do it, than the gender of the person there.” With the exception of Barron – “He’s 12 let him be 12, please” – she has no sympathy whatsoever for Trump’s children. “They’re adults who’ve made the decision to work in this administration.” Had her mother been elected, she says she would never have gone to work for her, so I ask if she shares others’ distaste at Trump employing his family.“I think the president should be able to hire whoever he or she thinks are best qualified. I do not believe that many of the people that he has hired have been qualified to do the jobs. Not only do I want an administration that isn’t venal, corrupt and focused on making life harder for millions of Americans, I also want a competent administration. So for me, the larger question is the collision of cruelty and incompetence and corruption that we see across the administration.”Given her father’s track record, I’m curious to know how she would feel if Stormy Daniels were to take down the presidency. “I haven’t followed that as closely as I have everything that’s emerging around the Russia investigation. But I do think it’s important that no one is above the law, and so whatever investigations come out of what Mueller’s doing, or the other ways in which many people are attempting to hold the president accountable, I think it’s important that those continue.” Following the scenes in Charlottesville last summer, she must have considered the danger of violence if Trump’s supporters feel he is unduly hounded out of office. The spectacle of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Klansmen marching through the Virginia town last August, bearing torches and swastikas, sent shockwaves through America and cost one counter-protester her life. When Trump declared there were “fine people” marching on the Unite The Right rally, to many frightened Americans the nation’s politics felt profoundly and ominously altered. Just how febrile does Clinton consider the situation? She looks grave. “Quite, I think.”Her assistant announces that our time is up, and I turn my recorder off, but Clinton tells me to turn it back on. Now that she’s really here, she wants to keep talking.Since Barbara Bush died, she says, she’s thought a lot about the importance of intentions. “I disagreed with her husband on so much, and with her on so much. But I also never doubted that she believed what she and her husband were fighting for was going to be to the benefit of most Americans. She really believed that what they were doing was the right thing to do.“I used to believe all that mattered was the bottom line of the outcome, like, how many lives were improved, how many people were saved, how many more people got to go to school without debt, how many people had healthcare, how many women got to have paid maternity leave. I still believe that is what matters most. But I also now believe that intentions and tone and decency matter, because I think the wreckage that we’re seeing at this moment is one that will, I hope, be repaired on the policy standpoint when we elect Democrats. But I think we will still then have work to do on repairing the tone in our country, the exposure of the real racist and sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic and antisemitic feeling which is on the rise in our country – a rot that has been exposed.”We are well over time now, and I glance at her assistant, but Clinton hasn’t finished. “I think one of the big mistakes,” she continues, “was, for so long, we focused on tolerance, which I just think is insufficient. People tolerated casual misogyny, but casual misogyny is maybe the gateway drug. We have freedom of speech, which I do think is hugely important – and yet people thought you couldn’t dispute hateful things, because they’re like – well, it’s freedom of speech. Well, freedom of speech doesn’t mean there is freedom of consequences.“Sure, you should not be in prison because you said something racist. But you also shouldn’t be able to run for president. And yet here we are.”She Persisted Around The World, published by Philomel Books, is available at the  bookshop for £9.99 (discounted from £12.99).

This is the inner matter of the UK,” Putin said.“And I guess we can suspect that those who wanted the UK to leave the EU are Russian agents,” he added, noting that the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was among those campaigning to leave the European Union.“If they want to worsen their relationships with Russia they can blame all their mortal sins on us and this is actually the case nowadays,” Putin said. “Brexit, and Catalonia and the Skripal case, God knows what – and this plane again.”Putin’s comments to the heads of international news agencies on the margins of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, follow a statement by Johnson backing international demands for Russia to be held accountable for the fate of MH17, the Malaysian Airlines flight downed over war-torn eastern Ukraine nearly four years ago killing all 298 people on board. In a statement, Johnson said the incident, which claimed the lives of 10 British nationals, was “an egregious example of the Kremlin’s disregard for innocent life”. “The Kremlin believes it can act with impunity,” he said. “The Russian government must now answer for its actions in relation to the downing of MH17. “The UK fully supports Australia and the Netherlands in their request to the Russian Federation to accept state responsibility, and to cooperate with them in their efforts to deliver justice for the victims of this tragedy. “Instead of seeking to undermine the investigation through the deluge of disinformation we have seen from Russia about MH17 in the past, the Russian Federation must fulfil its obligations under UN security council resolution 2166 to provide any requested assistance to the investigation. “To do otherwise would be a violation of the UN’s resolution, and to deny the families the justice they seek for their loved ones.” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the MH17 findings, saying Russia had been barred from taking part in the investigation and did not trust its results.The Russian defence ministry said the missile “more than likely” came from Ukrainian arsenals.

She was anxious. “I kept telling myself don’t worry, relax, have a good night’s sleep and a fresh start tomorrow.” Her husband, a doctor, was on a night shift, so she was alone. At about 1am, her son started to cry. While holding him, she also burst into tears.“He was crying and I was crying,” she said. At that point, Liu decided she would never have another child. “Thank you, family planning. One is definitely enough,” she said.For decades, from the late 1970s, China’s one-child policy barred many couples from having multiple children. Over the past five years, the country has been phasing out that policy, making new exemptions and eventually allowing all parents to have two children. Now authorities may be considering lifting limits altogether. But experts say the change is unlikely to much affect the country’s demographic direction. Prohibited by the high costs of education, housing and childcare, few Chinese couples actually want more than two children. Even under the two-child rule, few have chosen to have more than one.“Even if our government lifts the limits on how many children a family can have, I don’t think there will be a big increase of newborns,” said Wen Xi, 28, head of marketing at a radio station in Beijing. “Feeding ourselves is hard enough, let alone feeding a new life.”She has decided to spend her energy and money on herself and her mother, who raised Wen on her own.It was reported this week that China’s state council, its cabinet, had commissioned a study on the impact of scrapping restrictions on family size, a move that could happen as soon as this year. It would mark an end to one of the largest social engineering experiments the world has seen, one that many regard as a mistake. Today, China faces an ageing population with little social support, a shrinking workforce and one of the world’s lowest fertility rates.“It is just another historical policy blunder that the government, perhaps society as well, would like to erase from memory quickly. But this one will not be easy,” said Wang Feng, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine.Liu, for example, has been resisting her mother-in-law’s calls for another grandchild. “From the day my son was born, we were competing with other parents on what kind of milk powder he was drinking, what kind of instrument he would learn, which kindergarten was better, which primary school would be better, which tutor is better. All this competition is driving us and our son crazy,” she said.More young, professional women want just one child or none at all. “Definitely not,” said Wei Teng, a cultural studies scholar based in Guangzhou, on whether she would consider a second child. Even if couples were willing to have more children, the cohort of Chinese parents today is small. According to Yong Cai, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, China experienced a “baby bust” in the 1990s, a decade after the one-child policy was implemented. At the end of the 1980s, the number of births a year was about 28m by the mid-1990s it had dropped to 18m.“We have fewer people having children, so the number of new births will continue to decline no matter what,” Yong said. Now we were seeing “the echo of that baby bust”, he said. China’s family planning limits have been maintained through forced abortions and sterilisations, and steep fines. Some joke that Chinese authorities will deploy its interventionist methods to encourage the birth rate. An image of one of China’s iconic red propaganda banners, doctored to say “If you don’t have children when you should, we will push you to become pregnant”, received more than 6,000 likes after it was posted online this year. It is already common for managers in the private sector and academia to refuse female applicants. Many companies prefer to employ women who have already had one child, safe in the knowledge that their child-rearing days are over. “If the Chinese government does not enforce protections on female employees, companies will have more reasons to turn down female candidates,” said Emily Zheng, an academic based in Beijing who studies popular culture.Still, loosening family planning restrictions has already had a positive impact at the micro-level, on inidual families. Ning, 34, who works at a bank in Hangzhou, remembers when his mother became pregnant in 1989 with what was then known as an illegal second child. Afraid that neighbours would report her to family planning controllers who would force her to have an abortion, Ning’s mother hid in a nearby village. When Ning’s little sister was born, his parents, both farmers, paid their life savings in fines, the equivalent of about $100.In 2015, Ning found himself in the same situation. His wife was expecting another child after already having a girl. They considered an abortion but heard there might be a loophole. For months the couple shuttled between government departments. A few months before his wife’s due date, they were little more than halfway through applying for the exemption when China announced all parents could now have a second child. “All our problems were gone. All we needed now was proof that my wife was pregnant, that’s all, and then we waited for our second child. We felt really lucky.”Ning said he and his wife were unlikely to have a third child. “Having two kids is enough for us,” he said.

The White House described the move as “Orwellian nonsense”, but Malaysia Airlines, Air Canada, Air France, and Finnair, among others, made changes to the way they described Taiwan before a reported deadline late on Friday. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Qantas, the only Australian airline targeted, has been given an extension until mid-2018 to decide on its course of action.  Australia has found similar changes were also made on two of Australia’s biggest flight booking websites: Student Flights and Flight Centre.The list of Taiwanese destinations on both websites was simultaneously altered from “Taiwan” to “Taiwan, Republic of China” in mid-2015. References to Hong Kong were also changed to describe it as a special administrative region of China, replacing “Hong Kong” with “Hong Kong (SAR) China”. The company that owns both websites, the Flight Centre Travel Group, denied suggestions that the Chinese government mounted pressure over the descriptions. A spokesman said the changes were made by a third-party data supplier – who compiles and updates the list of international airports – and were not directly done by the Flight Centre Travel Group. The company has operated in China since 2002, but announced an expansion in the Chinese mainland in early 2016. The description of Taiwan as part of China is highly contentious and a sensitive issue for Beijing. Taiwan views itself as an independent sovereign state, and maintains separate relations with more than a dozen other countries. Beijing, however, treats Taiwan as a breakaway province and believes it will eventually be reunified with China. It refuses diplomatic relations with any state that formally recognises Taiwan.In recent months, the issue has created difficulties for multinational corporations, Taiwan’s last remaining allies, and even regional councils in Australia. The Marriott International hotel chain was forced to apologise to China this year after an online customer survey described Macau, Taiwan, Tibet and Hong Kong in a way that suggested they were independent countries. Beijing shut down Marriott’s website and China’s Cyberspace Administration, the internet regulator, said the company had “seriously violated national laws and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people”. Marriott issued an apology saying it respected China’s territorial integrity but not the “separatist groups that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China”. The US retailer Gap was also forced into an apology after selling a T-shirt with a map of China that did not include Taiwan or Tibet. This month, the Dominican Republic dumped official ties with Taiwan in favour of China, leaving the island state with just 19 diplomatic allies worldwide.The Caribbean country said at the time that it “recognises that there is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory”.Weeks later, Burkina Faso followed suit and severed formal ties with Taiwan. This month, the Rockhampton council’s commercial arm in central Queensland took responsibility for airbrushing the Taiwanese flag from a children’s art project before a big international beef expo.“Advance Rockhampton made a decision to change one bull statue on display in Quay Street in line with the Australian government’s approach of adhering to the one-China policy,” the Advance Rockhampton general manager, Tony Cullen, told the ABC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00231bfbcc1f511f4277dd86620655c238bfe4c2/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=145f68334d0ea332fdc256f567b82e69","title":"ramadan easier nigeria new york bim adewunmi","story":"Back when we lived in Nigeria, the rules were simple and the daylight hours of the fasting month remained (almost) constantIt’s that time of year again. Thanks to the vagaries of a lunar calendar, Ramadan 2018 is upon us a little earlier.When I lived in Nigeria, the rules were simple and the daylight hours of the fasting month remained (almost) constant. Day 1 was not that dissimilar to Day 15 or even Day 26, year in, year out our position just north of the equator served to bring a reliable sameness to the holy month.

Further away from the equator as we are, the day’s length changes with the seasons.

Photograph: Getty Images Record numbers of third-level students are seeking counselling for anxiety and related mental health problems, new figures show.Counsellors say numbers seeking therapy or counselling have surged since 2010, from 6,000 students to well over 10,000 last year. The latest set of figures – which relate to the 201617 academic year – are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of demand given that data is still being compiled from a quarter of higher education institutions.They come at a time of growing concern over the rate of anxiety among pupils at primary and second-level, as well as third-level.Anxiety was the single biggest issue of concern among students last year, accounting for 40 per cent of all those seeking counselling.Counsellors say they believe social media is playing a key role by amplifying stressful events such as relationship break-ups, disagreement with friends and long-term effects of school bullying. However, they caution that a range of other factors may also be at play, such as increased awareness and openness around mental health issues, along with social issues such as the impact of the economic crash on families, the cost of rent, pressure to succeed in college and thwarted expectations over employment or home ownership.Treasa Fox, a spokeswoman for Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education, said most students seek help when they face issues such as social anxiety, panic attacks, acute stress, persistent worrying, phobias, withdrawal and isolation.An inability to problem-solve or cope with normal life challenges, alcohol and substance misuse, acting out in class or with peers, along with self-harm or suicidal thoughts or actions are also common issues.“Anxiety issues are showing more in lecture theatres and in practicals, so another substantial part of our work is to provide consultation and guidance to academic staff who encounter this in their daily interface with students,” she said.An estimated 190,000 students are registered in higher education, with one counsellor for every 3,000 students.Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education says international guidelines recommend one professional staff member for every 1,000 to 1,500 students.“Funding of student counselling services has not kept pace with the year-on-year increase on demand for services,” Ms Fox said.“When coupled with increased complexity of presentations, and ever increasing levels of self-harm and suicidal risk among this population, the provision is out of kilter with what’s needed.”She said underfunding means many students may not be able to access support for several weeks.“We need more full-time staff, to continue the institution-wide work, and funding to increase provision when demand increases,” she said.The Department of Education says it has increased funding for higher education in recent years, following almost a decade of cuts.This includes a new PRSI levy on employers that is set to further increase funding for the sector over the coming year. * Are you in crisis?

Photograph: Will OliverEPAProposals that the UK would use the Irish “backstop” provisions in Britain as well as Northern Ireland after Brexit will simply not be acceptable, the EU told British negotiators at talks in Brussels this week.A senior EU official on Thursday night described the proposals from prime minister Theresa May as a “fantasy”.The UK is proposing to maintain regulatory alignment with the whole of the EU for a limited period after transition out of the EU to avoid cutting the North off from the rest of the UK and to obviate the necessity for a border on the Irish Sea.But its negotiators were told during three days of talks here that “regulatory alignment was not available on an all-UK basis”, because it would mean a form of cherry-picking and a breach of fundamental single market rules.And the UK could not be allowed simply to commit to joint all-UK customs controls on a “time-limited basis” because they would “undermine the whole purpose of the guarantee”.The EU official warned that progress on the Irish border – “let alone substantive progress” – was proving “elusive”.The UK is suggesting the withdrawal agreement protocol and its backstop guarantee should include an assumption that an eventual alternative arrangement will be agreed for frictionless borders between the UK and the EU as a whole. But if such an agreement is not forthcoming, officials here say, there must be the backstop provisions to fall back on. Time-limiting their application would remove that guarantee.In the Northern Ireland strand of the discussions, they had made progress on issues such as the single electricity market, and VAT rules, but had not discussed the “crunch” issues of the Border, regulatory alignment and customs.The issue was raised, however, by the UK team in the discussion on the future relationshiptrade agreement, where they said that Ms May was determined to implement the backstop on an all-UK basis “through the overall EU-UK relationship”.The EU team said that the “backstop must be Northern Ireland-specific”.“We have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to this,” the senior official said.A senior official described the talks on the full range of Brexit issues, from Northern Ireland to the future relationship, as frustrating, observing that: “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa, I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.”The  reported senior sources at the Brexit department, however, rejecting the suggestion that Brussels had dismissed the UK’s new backstop plan, suggesting that it was “simply a negotiating position” and that they believed the EU was open to the idea. “It’s a public stance for them to take during the negotiation,” one said.A No 10 source added: “This is what they do every time. As usual we’ve heard it all before. There’s nothing they’ve said which concerns us.”In their discussions of an overall trade deal, the UK rejected the suggestion from the EU of a free trade pact, and pressed their demands for a generalised system of mutual recognition and managed ergence. EU officials said that a system of mutual recognition, however, would not be available outside the single market – it would require higher external levels of trust than internally.10:33\t\t\t        A Yes vote will mean Ireland has finally grown up as a nation that now will respect all it\u0026#8217s citizens,\u0026hellip -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3508852.1527281263!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord yes yes yes a resounding emphatic yes","story":"President Michael D.

Photograph: Cyril Byrne Yes, Yes, Yes. A resounding, emphatic Yes. And what a way to say it – the only way to say it: with conviction and clarity. This massive vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution leaves no doubt. The Irish people have taken ownership of their abortion issue. They have taken it out of the hands of unrepresentative lobby groups and celibate clerics and decided how they want to approach it.On Friday, with steely assurance, a new generation of all the generations faced down the suffocating old certainties and swept them aside. On Friday, May 25th, 2018, they stood up and were not afraid to be counted. Because those days are gone now.The official result has yet to be declared, but the exit polls point only in one direction, and it is going to be a monumental change and a major milestone in modern Irish history.You could feel it in the air in the last week of the referendum campaign. Something had changed and something big was about to happen. It was there in the faces of the younger people – out there agitating, unashamed to be seeking basic rights for Irish women, because they were in the right.It was there in the noncommittal comments of older men and women. People misinterpreted them as the words of No voters who didn’t fancy being ridiculed for bucking a liberal trend. Instead, they were merely keeping their counsel and waiting to have their say.Thirty-five years is a long time to wait for a isive and dangerous clause to be excised from the Constitution. But for those who waited decades to see those lines equating the life of a foetus from conception to its living, breathing mother, the 15 hours it would take for the nation to vote probably felt like a lifetime.There couldn’t have been a better day for a vote. The sun shone on the island, welcoming back the thousands of men and women who traversed the globe and returned to vote. The sight of them arriving at ports and airports with their “Repeal” jumpers and wheelie cases moved the most hard-hearted observers to tears.These where the children of the women who had no choice, returning home from far-flung places and bringing back the gift of choice.All day, up and down the country, the voters streamed into polling stations, exceeding turnout expectations from early morning. The huge number of young people, young women in particular, many with babies and toddlers, did the heart good. You could sense the mood of charge in their faces as they came into the polling stations, anxiously scanning the tables, eager to hand over their cards.“I was torn, but I voted for my daughters,” said one women.“We were only exporting the problem,” said her husband.The Taoiseach voted in his local school in Castleknock. Scoil Thomáis was swarming with photographers when Leo Varadkar arrived.He said he was confident.“The lads at my gym all told me they are voting Yes.”Many more were in rural locations around the State. These were the men and women from the big international photo agencies, hoping to capture the image of Catholic Ireland voting away the vestiges of church authority from their private lives.The presiding officer in Knock had to tell them to leave. With its shrine and place as the pilgrimage capital of Ireland, they descended on the Mayo village in the search of voting nuns, but they were unsuccessful. They had been told there was a big mural of the Blessed Virgin in Knock, but that has been painted over. They were most annoyed.If the smiling women and the reticent men and the huge numbers voting in Dublin and other major urban areas was an indicator of rapidly gathering change, there were worries in more rural areas.“The voting is very brisk, but everyone is very elderly. I think they’re being bussed in. I’d be worried,” said an acquaintance in Roscommon.But everywhere the change was happening.As the day wore on, and the figures climbed, the staying hand of pious history was always there in the background. There have been disappointments before. Powerful interests who exert huge influence in Irish political and social life were not going to lightly give up the fight.In the headquarters of Together for\u0026nbspYes, they had run out of posters and people were offering to walk the city streets wearing sandwich boards. Minister for Health Simon Harris called in to see them for the first time.Artwork along one wall of their offices – quieter than ever they have been in the last three months – had a quote from WB Yeats: “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”Education is the enemy of those who would work to keep Irish men and women slaves to a dark past.The volunteers were optimistic, and a little teary. But, sure, who wasn’t.They recounted trips to the airport to welcome those who were home to vote. One overseas camera crew was trying to find a No\u0026nbspvoter to balance their report. They couldn’t, until somebody noticed a plane from Medjugorje was due in.They waited for the passengers to come through and finally came up with three people who would be voting No.Yes, the signs were there. Driving into town, groups of volunteers gathered on roundabouts were being cheered and beeped by passing motorists. Joggers gave the thumbs-up. But on a flyover, a group of anti-abortion campaigners were getting nothing from the cars travelling below.The Taoiseach wore his little Yes\u0026nbspbadge on his lapel. He said in the Dáil during the week that if there is a vote for repeal “Ireland will still be the same country it was before the vote. It will just be a little bit more compassionate.”And some who have been around since 1983 will be a little bit more emotional.\u0026nbspOur morning started with a trip to the Phoenix Park to see Michael D Higgins vote.\u0026nbspThe then senator Michael D was fiercely opposed to the “callous” referendum on the Eighth Amendment in 1983, when he was president of the Labour Party.\u0026nbspHe said the TDs promoting it were “monumental in their hypocrisy” and then quoted Michael Davitt: “If the Irish had a weakness worse than drink, it was moral cowardice.” Not anymore.\u0026nbspAfter he voted, he got into his car and prepared to leave. Then he saw me and got out again, striding over to say hello.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Donegal looks like one of the few counties in the country which could return a no vote, Stephen Maguire reports at 10.20am.With 14,652 votes tallied, the No vote stands at 52 per cent and the Yes vote at 48 per cent.Those boxes relate mainly to the Inishowen peninsula, including Letterkenny. The figures at present suggest that the peninsula will return a No vote in the abortion referendum.The result appears to be slightly closer in areas such as Buncrana and Moville.Boxes are still being opened with both the No and Yes campaigns suggesting a very close contest in Donegal.It is early days in the count centre at the Aura Leisure Centre in Letterkenny, but it appears that Donegal could be again about to return a no vote.At 10.11am in Offaly, Eoghan MacConnell reports that while the constituency may be the stronghold of No campaigners like Renua Leader Cllr John Leahy and rebel Sinn Féin TD Carol Nolan, early tallies suggest the Yes side will win with ease in the mainly rural constituency. Counting for OffalyNorth Tipperary began this morning in Banagher College as the first 36 of the 125 boxes were opened at 9am. According to the very early tallies, the Yes side has a 59.17 per cent lead on the No side at 40.83 per cent. The tallies showed just two of 42 boxes counted so favoured the No side. That box was from Kinnitty near Birr with 169 No votes to 138 Yes and a second box in nearby Cloghan. Offaly North Tipperary FG TD Marcella Corcoran Kennedy said she was delighted by the early indications. Speaking at the count centre this morning, she said overturning the Eighth Amendment will be one of the most memorable points in her political career. Ms Corcoran Kennedy said she believed the large majority indicated in the poll should ensure legislation is passed quickly. “The fact that it looks like the result is so resounding means that those who chose to filibuster, chose to delay legislation, chose to behave irresponsibly and recklessly in the chamber, will be thumbing their nose at the will of the Irish people and I don’t think that that will be tolerated,” she remarked. Ms Nolan, who had canvassed for a No vote and lost the Sinn Féin party whip having voted against her party on the referendum, was not in the count centre this morning. Meanwhile, Renua Leader John Leahy admitted he was surprised by the strong Yes vote and would respect the vote of the electorate. With 30 to 40 per cent of the electorate opposed to repeal, Cllr Leahy said he believed there could be political instability in the wake of the vote. He said he felt sorry for the cohort of people who voted No, adding that Renua would now focus on ensuring there were supports for women in Ireland. “We have half of GPs saying they are not going to administer abortions,” he claimed. At 10.09am, Elaine Keogh reports from Louth that with 25 of the 179 boxes (14 per cent) tallied Yes is on 66.92 per cent and No on 33.08 per cent.Stan Henderson reports from Laois at 10.07am that early tallies indicate a 63 per cent Yes vote and a 37 per cent no vote so far. This is based on the opening of 30 ballot boxes out of 110 in total and a mixture of both rural and urban.In Galway East at 10.07am, Declan Rooney reports that early tallies in the constituency suggest a substantial Yes vote is likely with 60.58 per cent of votes counted.So far 31 of the 130 total boxes in the Galway East constituency have been opened and counted, which is almost 24 per cent of the total number of boxes, and there are clear suggestions that the national exit poll trends will continue in this rural Connacht constituency.While some of the larger Galway towns like Loughrea were included in that early tally, there were also a significant number of small villages included in the 31. To date only three boxes tallied have returned No votes.The tally counters are by and large representing the Yes campaign and they reported a huge swell in their numbers last night in Galway East after a Facebook appeal for them to join in the effort at the count centre in Headford Co Galway today. The tally figures provided for this constituency are from the Yes campaign.In Louth at 9.58am, Elaine Keogh reports that 13 of the 179 boxes tallied, the Yes are on 66.76 per cent and the No on 33.24 per cent. The returning officer does not expect a final result before 3pm.Meanwhile in LongfordWestmeath, the story might be slightly different.Liam Cosgrove reports at 9.58am that while last night’s exit polls may well have indicated a landslide victory for the Yes side, it would appear the outcome in LongfordWestmeath could be considerably tighter.That is from the initial indications taken from early tallies in the Longford end of the constituency with two boxes returning wins for the No side while another in north Longford had both sides deadlocked.There is a considerable presence here in Kenagh’s St Dominic’s Community Centre too, reflecting the huge level of engagement the referendum ignited among the wider electorate.In Cork East at 9.53am, Olivia Kelleher reports that 15 per cent of boxes had been opened and the vote in those was tallied at Yes 64 per cent and No 36 per cent.Overall indications from the postal vote which is comprised of gardai and army is 62 per cent Yes and 38 per cent No, while special votes from the elderly and infirm were coming in at 60 per cent Yes and 40 per cent No.In RoscommonEast Galway, Dan Dooner reports at 9.51am that there is cautious optimism among the Yes campaign after the opening of the first boxes at The Hyde Centre. One box from the town of Boyle showed 221 votes for repeal and 112 for No, according to Fine Gael Senator Frank Feighan, while MEP Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan tallied a box from Roscommon town, which he said showed a vote of about 55 Yes and 45 No.“If that is reflected around the county, hopefully we’ll get a win,” he said.The MEP added that he had taken readings from around Roscommon and said he “had a general feeling that people were going to go for it”. He added that campaigners had received “at worst a 5050”on the doorsteps and praised those who had driven the Yes campaign in RoscommonEast Galway. Roscommon was the only county in Ireland to vote No to marriage equality in 2015.Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here10:35\t\t\t        \u0026#10I\u0027m a Slovenian living and working in Ireland and went to check Slovenian news and the first thing I see\u0026hellip -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3508377.1527276417!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"get your voice heard on brexit talks corbyn urges ni politicians","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s Labour Party, poses for a selfie with Prof Deirdre Heenan during a visit to Lifford Bridge on the Border.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireNorthern Ireland needs a voice at the Brexit talks table in London, British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he urged Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party to reach a deal on restoring Stormont. “Please, to the parties in Stormont: you have to come together to re-form a government there. I hope they understand that message and I hope that we can make very rapid progress on that,” Mr Corbyn declared in Derry.“It is impossible to go through a period so crucial as Brexit negotiations without a voice for Northern Ireland being made at the table by the political classes in NI,” he told Derry Chamber of Commerce.The local economy in Derry “depends absolutely” on the ability of local businesses to travel freely across the Border with the Republic, said the Labour leader, on the second day of a visit to NI.“The idea of a hard Border is impossible to conceive that it would do anything other than seriously damage this area and damage the life-chances of people in this area in a place which has already suffered.“Any kind of border, physical border, virtual reality border, technological border, whatever, would be very damaging to the economy,” he said, sharply criticising the performance of Conservative prime minister, Theresa May. Emphasising that he wanted to see a Brexit deal that protects jobs across the United Kingdom, Mr Corbyn yet again favoured a customs deal with the European Union and continued tariff-free access after it leaves.Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee welcomed Mr Corbyn’s commitment to avoid a hard border.She repeated the Government’s call for the British government to agree to a “legally operable text” around the backstop option post-Brexit that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the European Union’s customs union and single market in the event of no alternative proposal to maintain an invisible border.“Our preferred option continues to be the closest possible relationship and any proposals to that effect are welcome but the backstop must be dealt with separately it would ensure no border or related customs checks or controls in the absence of a close relationship,” she told The .“Irrespective of Mr Corbyn’s comments the British government must still come forward with the proposals on the backstop and we need to see sufficient progress on this by the June European Council. I remain optimistic that this can happen.”During his time in Derry and Belfast, Mr Corbyn heard mounting concerns about the post-Brexit existence of the Border and, indeed, concerns about the wider Brexit exit deal.Under a “backstop” deal reached last December, Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU regulations necessary to ensure that no hard Border is needed, though this deal is increasingly being questioned now by leading British Cabinet members.“Crucial decisions are going to be made in the next three months, and I understand very clearly the message that you have given me here this morning,” he told his audience.Meanwhile, the Labour leader said the situation where unelected civil servants have had to take major policy decisions because of the lack of the NI Executive and Assembly cannot continue.“It is unconscionable that you have civil servants making major decisions, then challenged by the courts, with elected politicians having no say whatsoever,” he declared.Welcoming the Labour leader, the president of Derry’s Chamber of Commerce, Jennifer McKeever, said Derry is “the city at the heart of the Brexit conundrum”.Delivering a strong message that 90 per cent of local businesses want to stay in the European Union’s customs union and single market, she said they serve two counties, two countries, two jurisdictions.“Every day, thousands of us cross the Border for work, for education, for health and for trade. The EU is not a foreign, far-away bureaucracy – it’s a couple of miles from where we sit. “It’s where many of our staff live and where we find our customers and trading partners. Everybody accepts that it would be unacceptable to reintroduce a hard Border in Ireland.”However, she warned that it is “infinitely more difficult to understand” the declarations from London politicians that the UK “can pull out of the customs union and single market” and avoid a hard Border.“The truth is we just cannot see how you can square this circle: to both leave the EU and to ensure no Border – to create the unique solution for NI Ireland and to do it without damaging our peace and prosperity.”Speaking directly to Mr Corbyn, she said the customs union and single market offer a market of 500 million people: “It’s under those conditions that we have built the business community that you are sitting with this morning.”Warning that local patience is “wearing thin”, she insisted that the British government’s favoured options of a customs partnership, or a technological deal to solve Border issues do not “inspire confidence”.Urging more British politicians to visit Northern Ireland, Bonnie Anley, the chair of Foyle Port, said it is “vital” that they “experience and see” the day-to-day realities that are now facing local firms.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Three in five Britons support a \u0026#39hostile environment\u0026#39 for illegal immigrants, poll showsAbortion referendum exit poll results trigger calls for Northern Ireland to follow suitAfghan interpreter scheme fails to relocate any to safety in UK, report findsDonald Trump hails \u0026#39very productive talks with North Korea\u0026#39 amid signs Kim Jong-un summit could go aheadDonald Trump says ZTE will pay $1.3bn fine and provide \u0026#39high-level security guarantees\u0026#39 to resume businessWounded Indiana teacher \u0026#39ran towards bullets\u0026#39 as he stopped school shooterObese people should start work later to avoid rush hour crush, government advisor saysComment: SNP\u0026#39s monster report on independence is much ado about nothingAdding iodine to salt could help children reach full academic potentialMatilda the Musical moves start time to 7pm as audiences say they want to hit the town afterwardsHugh Grant finally ties knot at 57 as he marries Swedish girlfriend Anna Eberstein Dispatch: Emotions run high as bitter ides are laid bare in Ireland\u0026#39s abortion referendum Comment: SNP currency proposals  \u0026#39disastrous\u0026#39 for an independent Scotland\u0026#39s economyComment: The monarchy reaches parts politics cannot reach – it should stay that wayRoy of the Rovers for the modern age: star gets flash haircut, million pound contract and hints of transferExposed: How \u0026#39betting scam match fixers\u0026#39 planned to rig England cricket TestSri Lanka groundsman: ‘Make sure England Test ends within four days?

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares. At minimum it is adding 3 million tonnes of rice. We have also developed SUB1 varieties with salt, drought and stagnant flooding tolerance.”Biofortified beans in RwandaDfid is now the biggest funder of HarvestPlus, whose work into fortified crops was started in 2003. Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM. The salutary lesson on this is “golden rice”, a GM strain engineered to boost vitamin A. More than a decade after it was hailed as a potential game-changer, its progress to farmers’ fields has stalled in a blizzard of regulation and public opposition.If the next green revolution is to come, harnessing nature rather than genetically modifying it may prove to be quickest and most efficient route.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Three in five Britons support a \u0026#39hostile environment\u0026#39 for illegal immigrants, poll showsAbortion referendum exit poll results trigger calls for Northern Ireland to follow suitAfghan interpreter scheme fails to relocate any to safety in UK, report findsDonald Trump hails \u0026#39very productive talks with North Korea\u0026#39 amid signs Kim Jong-un summit could go aheadDonald Trump says ZTE will pay $1.3bn fine and provide \u0026#39high-level security guarantees\u0026#39 to resume businessWounded Indiana teacher \u0026#39ran towards bullets\u0026#39 as he stopped school shooterObese people should start work later to avoid rush hour crush, government advisor saysComment: SNP\u0026#39s monster report on independence is much ado about nothingAdding iodine to salt could help children reach full academic potentialMatilda the Musical moves start time to 7pm as audiences say they want to hit the town afterwardsHugh Grant finally ties knot at 57 as he marries Swedish girlfriend Anna Eberstein Dispatch: Emotions run high as bitter ides are laid bare in Ireland\u0026#39s abortion referendum Comment: SNP currency proposals  \u0026#39disastrous\u0026#39 for an independent Scotland\u0026#39s economyComment: The monarchy reaches parts politics cannot reach – it should stay that wayRoy of the Rovers for the modern age: star gets flash haircut, million pound contract and hints of transferExposed: How \u0026#39betting scam match fixers\u0026#39 planned to rig England cricket TestSri Lanka groundsman: ‘Make sure England Test ends within four days?

This is what I want you to knowThis risk, and the cost to the NHS, increases with every point of BMI and could result in a major economic toll as well as the health cost if governments fail to get to grips with it, the researchers from the UK and Ireland said.While Scotland currently has fractionally higher rates of morbid obesity, 4 per cent in 2015 compared with 3 per cent in England and Wales, this is due to reverse.Under current trends it is predicted that 11 per cent of the population in Wales will be morbidly obese in 2035, roughly 340,000 adults, while Scotland is likely to plateau at about 5 per cent and England will rise to about 8 per cent.“Wales have a greater portion of the population deprived per capita than England, this may be a potential reason,” Laura Webber, an honorary assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a director of public health modelling at the UK Health Forum, told The Independent.“In terms of morbid obesity specifically, Wales only have one obesity clinic, which could also impact.”Morbidly obese people should be given free flu jabs, says healthKhan to ban junk food advertising on London transportIn England, where close to 4.4 million adults will be affected, 16 per cent of men between the age of 55 and 64 are predicted to be morbidly obese – the highest prevalence of any group.“The morbidly obese group are particularly vulnerable to diseases, which is of course very costly to the NHS,” Ms Webber added.Morbid obesity is already a huge burden on the economy and health services, accounting for around a third of all obesity-related costs.While overweight and obesity trends for Great Britain have been projected to 2035, until now there have been no trend estimates for morbid obesity.BMI is a widely accepted measure of obesity, calculated as a person’s weight ided by their height squared, to be morbidly obese it must exceed 40kgm2. Other metrics look at whether a person is suffering obesity related diseases before age 35.The latest findings on morbid obesity are being presented at the European Obesity Congress in Vienna on Saturday.Webber and her co-author, Laura Keaver from the Sligo Institute of Technology in the Republic of Ireland, said measures to reverse these trends and the underlying social causes “must be an important public health priority”.Health news in picturesHealth news in picturesResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping activeA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.\u0026#13Research from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.The family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said.

Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.\u0026#13Growth in obesity is predicted from annual health reports from each country – there was insufficient data for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – coupled with employment and education data – socioeconomic factors that have been shown to be important predictors of BMI.In Scotland, the significantly slower rate of growth can be attributed to work carried out by the Scottish government in addressing inequality, the researchers said.“The government put a massive push on developing a route map for how we can actually combat this,” said Ms Keaver.“They put together resources from the NHS that were proving to be effective. They did put a lot of work into it.”Meanwhile in England a tax on sugary drinks has helped many producers reformulate their products, but a voluntary levy on sugary foods has not resulted in manufacturers making significant reductions.For Wales, where the inequality between people in managerial-level jobs and routine or manual professions is expected to become more significant, the pair say health interventions should be targeted at these groups.A spokesperson for Public Health Wales told The Independent: “Health trends and future predictions are complex, and predictions should not be taken as facts – they provide us with a picture of where past trends may take us if nothing changes, and give us great motivation to try and change those trends for a better future.While tackling obesity, especially in early years, is a priority and a new obesity strategy is under development – to be published in the autumn – they added “we have a significant challenge to overcome”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s old ambassador to the EU, was criticised after he advised ministers in 2016 that leaving the EU would take around 10 years. He stepped down from his post shortly after.The EU says under the December agreement just Northern Ireland would stay in full alignment with the single market and customs union to prevent a hard border, while UK negotiators say they actually agreed that the whole UK would do so. The relevant text is somewhat ambiguous as to what was agreed.EU officials do not want the backstop to apply to the whole UK because it would give Britain access to the single market without having to uphold the so-called “four freedom” or submitting to the European Court of Justice. The UK says it cannot accept the backstop only applying to NI because that would create a potential customs border between Great Britain and NI  – which the DUP oppose. Theresa May has relied on the DUP for her majority in the House of Commons since she called an election and lost seats last year.The time-limiting element has now been introduced by the UK because Cabinet Brexiteers like Boris Johnson fear that an indefinite backstop could be a backdoor way of keeping the UK aligned with the EU in perpetuity. Ministers have publicly confirmed that a time-limited backstop is on the way.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

They say commitments already made by British negotiators in December – that the backstop would apply “unless and until” another solution is found – rule out a time-limit.The UK’s transition is designed to give officials more time to come up with another solution to solve the border – but means there would be yet another cliff-edge.A Government spokesperson did not deny the reports of the plan, only telling The Independent: “We\u0027re not going to be drawn on speculation – the PM has said we will bring forward our plans on the backstop shortly.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But when Tassi, the goat she raised with her business partner, Jason Lewis, gave birth to twins in the midst of a goat yoga session in Suwanee, Georgia, on Sunday afternoon, she was delighted.Ms Kibby and Mr Lewis run Red Wagon Goats, a goat yoga business based in Stone Mountain, Georgia (Ms Kibby teaches the yoga). They knew that Tassi was going to give birth soon. Another of their goats, Emmylou, had given birth to twins the previous day and, as Ms Kibby put it, “when one of them goes they all go.”  A post shared by Goat Yoga™ Arizona (@azgoatyoga) on May 21, 2018 at 6:31pm PDTThey did not think it would happen in the middle of a class.Red Wagon Goats was holding a goat yoga fundraising event at one of city’s parks on Sunday, when Tassi — named for the Tassili n’Ajjer site in Algeria — began to paw the ground, looking for a place to nest. Mr Lewis picked her up intending to take her to a trailer where she could give birth more privately, when she began to deliver.“She’s having this baby right here,” he said. (Several days later, the story of the birth was featured in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)     Mr Lewis and Ms Kibby are just two of the many goat owners who have joined the goat yoga craze. It started in 2016 and has spread from the Pacific Northwest to the rest of the country, and others, including Canada, South Africa and Australia.Goat yoga did not spring from some Burning Man brainstorm. It was born at a children\u0027s birthday party in Albany, Oregon, at the home of Lainey Morse, who had between six and eight pet goats at the time. One of the parents in attendance, Heather Davis, was a yoga instructor. Watching the kids cavort, she had a eureka moment: Why not combine goats and yoga?A post shared by Goat Yoga™ Arizona (@azgoatyoga) on Dec 20, 2016 at 4:30am PSTThe concept took off, fuelled by goat-lovers on Instagram. News of the trend was spread by the news media. But most viral stories die early goat yoga is stronger than ever.“I’m sure that everyone in the world thought that this was going to be done in five minutes,” Ms Morse said. “But it’s not. It keeps growing.”Ms Morse’s company, The Original Goat Yoga, now has 10 locations in different states and hundreds of competitors, (one of which, based in Arizona, snatched up GoatYoga). She has done goat yoga sessions with 10 of her 13 goats for employees of companies based in the area, including Intel, Adidas and Nike.She says that “no one has ever gotten hurt or head-butted” in a session but that there are plenty of goat-related distractions.Man who lived as a goat says it was a \u0027special kind of time\u0027“Sometimes they sneeze right in people\u0027s faces and the whole class just erupts in laughter,” she said. “I’ve had over 3,000 people through my class and only one person has gotten peed on, so that’s pretty good.” And “goats do poop. If people have a problem with that they probably shouldn’t come.”But she’d never heard of one giving birth during a class.Tassi was the first goat that Ms Kibby and Mr Lewis raised together. The first twin that she gave birth to on Sunday, Sue-Anna, has “bright blue eyes just like her momma,” Ms Kibby said proudly.The second kid came as a surprise. Clouds had begun to roll in during Sue-Anna’s birth and as the goat’s owners tended to her and the class cooed over the baby, lightning flashed and the hooves and head of another kid began to emerge. They named him Storm.“We have grandkids now,” Ms Kibby said.Escaped goat headbutts pensioner during rampage in Northern IrelandAmerican Airlines bans turtles, ferrets, goats from flightsTown terrorised by wild goats \u0027procreating like there\u0027s no tomorrow\u0027Men jailed for killing goat at petting zoo \u0027because they were hungry\u0027Why 100 wild goats are being evacuated from an Italian islandSue-Anna and Storm joined the other babies born over the weekend, Electra and Orion, bringing Ms Kibby and Mr Lewis’s head count up to 35. Red Wagon Goats holds family friendly yoga classes as well as sessions for adults 21 and up, after which they serve wine and chocolate. (Private events cost $40, or £34, a person for a minimum of 10 people.)They are hired by a surprising number of bachelorette parties. At one such party recently, Ms Kibby said, “Half the girls were from the south and half the girls were from New York and the New Yorkers were screaming if the goats got near them.”  But most people who attend their sessions have a hard time resisting the animals. At goat yoga, for example, the instructors tell their students they’re free to abandon the yoga part of the class at any time.“I am not delusional enough to think that they all are there to work out with me,” Ms Kibby said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Honduras plane crash - private jet crashes in TegucigalpaWhen asked at an economic forum in St Petersburg today whether a Russian army missile was involved, Putin said: Of course not.The Russian President claimed the Kremlin could not fully trust Dutch findings about the incident because Moscow had not been involved in the investigation.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow \u0026ldquoabsolutely denied allegations of Russian involvement.The doomed MH17 flight was shot down over territory held by pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.Earlier today, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte demanded Russia acknowledge its role and called on Moscow to cooperate.Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down on 17th July 2014, killing all 298 passengers on board.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

They are complying with the new rules in force from May 25.In future, GDPR means individuals can demand a copy of all data held about them, which must be supplied within 30 days.And in some cases they can ask for any data to be deleted in a formal right to be forgotten law.If you also run a business - even as a sole trader - you need to make sure you comply with the law on collecting your customers data.Last year handymen, gardeners and window cleaners were warned they could be fined if they try to drum up business by sending an email.Read our guide to the GDPR compliance deadline.GDPR comes into force today – businesses and organisations impacted by GDPR have had two years to get their systems ready.Companies who fail to comply but have shown awareness and taken steps to comply with GDPR will be treated less harshly than those who have not.Fines will be issued to those who do not comply.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them. They’re bad for your health.WHAT a shame – Roman Abramovich can’t get back into the country because we haven’t cleared his visa. So he’s sitting on his yacht somewhere, getting snippy. I’m not sure why we let Roman in in the first place.You don’t get his kind of money by being lovely to everybody, do you?First we helped wreck the Russian economy in the early 1990s by plundering its state run industries. Then we opened the doors to a whole bunch of Russkie gangsters – sorry, oligarchs – with boats the size of Poland. Anyway, I’ll probably end up glowing like a Belisha beacon just for writing this.BROADCASTER Dan Snow has admitted he lies to his daughters.He’s told them that during the war there were loads of female Spitfire pilots. Zooming around, shooting down krauts. He says he doesn’t want them to feel limited by their gender. He should have gone further. Told them that back then Britain was led by a nice lady called Winnie.And that the first person up Everest was a little girl called Hillary. And as for that Ada Hitler . . .THE Iraqis are executing the IS jihadi brides. Loads of them.Some of them are whining that they had no idea their husbands were evil Islamists. One of them said she thought she was marrying a rapper.Yeah, right love. We’ve got a few here, mind.Women who went out to join IS and then thought better of it. They’re lucky we won’t extradite them to Iraq.HEY – got your Royal Wedding gift bag yet? Guests to the wedding are flogging them on eBay for as little as £20,000. Hell of a bargain. I’ve got a bid in on one right now. It says it contains:I’VE got a bit of a soft spot for Victoria Beckham. She’s been criticised for not smiling at the wedding of Harry and Meghan.Some people have suggested Posh Spice was looking a bit grim because David had been out on the pull again. Nah. She wasn’t smiling because, basically, she’s a miserable cow.And I like that. Why should she have to wander around grinning like a village idiot?Keep the sulk and the pout, Vikki, love. Plus I liked what she was wearing at the bash. She was dressed as if for the funeral of someone she didn’t know very well. She looked great.SO, all four of the great American authors are dead. Both Tom Wolfe and Philip Roth died this week.Saul Bellow and the finest of them all, John Updike are already dead.These gentlemen were my heroes when I was growing up. But how long will they be remembered?Updike is already unfashionable on account of his alleged sexism. Wolfe and Bellow were quite right-wing, so the literary critics will quickly consign their books to the “dead white male” rubbish bin of history. And as a consequence, we will have lost an awful lot.Keep their work alive, whatever the critics tell you. Read The Bonfire of the Vanities, or Couples, or The Dean’s December and marvel at the insight and the beauty of the prose . . .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was widely praised for bringing Marlon Brandos Method style of acting to the screen.But many remember him for his 1952 testimony before the House Committee on un-American Activities.There, he outed suspected Hollywood communists at a time many were losing work due to an industry blacklist. The anger had not subsided when Kazan was given an honorary Oscar in 1999. Some boycotted the ceremony and when Kazan approached the podium, after being introduced by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Performers including Ed Harris and Nick Nolte sat grimly and refused to applaud. In his brief speech, Kazan offered no apologies. Carrying two books and a notepad, disgraced Weinstein walked slowly from a black SUV past crowds of reporters and TV crews.He gave a wry smile as he ran the media gauntlet towards the front door of the station.Weinstein — still being investigated for alleged sex crimes in London and LA — was questioned for around two hours before leaving the precinct in handcuffs flanked by two officers.In his first public appearance since October, he was then brought to a Manhattan court for a preliminary hearing.The former Miramax boss agreed to hand over $1million bail to ensure his release ahead of his trial, due to begin on 30 May.Weinstein will also wear a security tag, hand over his passport and submit to travel restrictions as part of his bail conditions.His lawyer Benjamin Brafman said outside court that Weinstein intends to plead not guilty.Mr Brafman added: We intend to move very quickly to dismiss these charges.We believe that they are constitutionally flawed. We believe that they are not factually supported by the evidence.Weinstein has denied non-consensual sex allegations, after around 100 women came forward to allege sexual misconduct and harassment by him.The avalanche of claims spawned the #MeToo movements, which saw sexual allegations levied against a host of Hollywood stars including Kevin Spacey, Ben Affleck and Brit star Ed Westwick.Lucia Evans - then aspiring star Lucia Stoller - told last year how she had been approached by Weinstein at Cipriani Upstairs, a club in New York, in 2004.The university student, now 34, said she gave him her number and an assistant set up a daytime meeting at the Miramax office, in the city a short time later.She says he then pounced on her when they were alone in an office together – forcing her to perform a sex act on him.Evans said: “I said, over and over: ‘I don’t want to do this, stop, don’t’. It was like it was just another day for him. It was no emotion.”She revealed she struggled with the decision to make a formal police complaint about Weinstein in an interview with the New Yorker yesterday.She told Ronan Farrow, one of the first journalists to report on the Weinstein allegations: At a certain point, you have to think about the greater good of humanity, of womankind.Last night leading #MeToo figures reacted to news of Weinsteins imminent arrest.Rose McGowan, who accuses him of raping her in 1997, said: I, and so many of Harvey Weinsteins survivors, had given up hope that our rapist would be held accountable by law.Twenty years ago, I swore that I would right this wrong. Today we are one step closer to justice.Investigators are also examining whether Weinstein broke an antiquated law that forbids luring or inducing any women to travel across state lines for the purpose of committing a sex crime, according to the Wall Street Journal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408834890.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fat workers start later work home rush hour anxiety","story":"Bosses should offer them flexible starts if they struggle on public transport or let them work from home.Professor Stephen Bevan told the European Congress on Obesity that firms should make more accommodations for overweight workers.Mr Bevan, of the Institute for Employment Studies, called for new laws so fat staff could sue if they felt they missed out on a job or promotion on weight grounds.Christopher Snowdon, of the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, branded the plan ludicrous.

They were also given behavioural support for six months.The rest received standard NHS weight loss advice.A year after being put on the programme, those put on meal replacements had lost 24 lbs, while those just given standard weight loss advice lost just 7 lbs.The findings were backed by former government obesity tsar Susan Jebb.She said: “It’s acceptable, effective and safe.“It’s only with all this info that we can really consider suggesting that it could be offered as a routine treatment for obesity.” She said it works because it is simple to follow and dramatically slashes calorie intake.Diet expert Prof Jebb, from Oxford University, said: “It is a break from old habits and a chance to re-establish new ones.“Losing a lot of weight is very motivating. Dieting is hard and boring and a short sharp programme may be easier to stick to that a long slow.” The Cambridge Weight Plan was developed by Dr Alan Howard at Cambridge University in the 1970s and launched as a commercial product in the UK in 1984.Fans include former Eastenders and Loose Women star Martine McCutcheon, who lost a stone in five weeks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As we walk along, the cameras move and follow us. For someone who values his privacy, it\u0027s a wonderful spot.Moored off shore is his boat, the Eclipse: registered in Bermuda, with a crew of 70, a helipad, a mini submarine.It is staggeringly large.Beyond it is another yacht, a little smaller, but still huge.This was Mr Abramovich\u0027s too, until he lost a bet and handed it over to a mate.We approach the Eclipse and politely call out to the staff on board.As an attempt to find and speak to a Russian billionaire about his visa issues, this was always likely to be futile.And so it was.Our first introductions were met with a clear \"no\".But on the radio from our boat to the bridge of the Eclipse we managed a brief convention.Could we find out, I ask somewhat foolishly, whether Mr Abramovich is aboard and able to speak to us.\"That\u0027s all well received, Sir. At this moment in time we are unable to comment on the location of any guests. That\u0027s unable to comment. Thank you.\" Obviously he wasn\u0027t going to speak to us, but a little bit of his empire up close is a useful hint of the life of an oligarch.So what\u0027s the British government\u0027s apparent issue? Russian man gets rich, enjoys life, invests in London plenty have.Why, as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson said this week, will the UK \"continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs who surround Putin?\"Mr Gould-Davies was serving in the British Embassy in Moscow when KGB defector Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London.He has watched Russian behaviour in Crimea, the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine and, most recently, the Salisbury attack.\"Russian and other wealth in the UK has long been an ethical concern, but we have a dramatic new concern in particular since the events in Salisbury,\" he said.\"Russia is presenting a more aggressive threat to the United Kingdom and other Western European countries than it has at any time since the Cold War period.\"Now the Russian state, the Putin regime, depends upon elite networks of power and influence and wealth.\"So the Russian State is on the one hand presenting a threat on the other hand it\u0027s been sustained and supported by elites who make use of the UK\u0027s financial services to keep their wealth safe.\"That cannot be right.\"On the same day that Mr Abramovich\u0027s visa issues emerged, the British government\u0027s foreign affairs select committee published \"Moscow\u0027s Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK\", a report which recommended that the government cracked down on Russian wealth in the UK.It is something that American banker and author Bill Browder has been calling for ever since he accused the Kremlin of murdering his lawyer.

The plot has reportedly been dubbed the ‘Gove-Davidson succession’.  It would see the Environment Secretary and leading Brexiteer become PM for a couple of years, finishing off Brexit negotiations.  But Mr Gove would just be in no.10 for a transitional period until Scottish Conservatives chief Ms Davidson takes over, according to \u0027the plan\u0027. Ms Davidson is often tipped as a future leader. A former Cabinet minister reportedly called her “the messiah” and the answer to Tory issues.  They told The Sun : “Michael wants to be the leader, but he also accepts he can’t fight a general election.  “He knows he’s toxic to too many voters after his education reforms and running the Leave campaign. “Ruth can and should fight the 2022 general election for us, as she’s got it all - but we need to fill the gap – and Michael can do that.”  Earlier this week, Ms Davidson appealed for more young people to join the party. Launching a new think tank, Onward, she said: Sometimes as Tories we just look a bit dour. A bit joyless, a bit authoritarian sometimes. We don\u0027t get to win if we start hectoring the people we need to vote for us. We don\u0027t get to say \u0027please stand on the right\u0027 like every Tube message out there.

The expensive, premium burgers came last after judges branded them “a huge disappointment” and slammed the taste as “awful” and the texture as “hideous”.

Alarm bells were raised when doctors discovered a swollen lymph node in the 34-year-old\u0027s neck.

Tragic Chadrack Mbala Mulo was just four when he died holding onto his mother\u0027s corpse in Hackney, East London, in October 2016. An inquest into his death heard that Chadrack, who was mute and autistic, had been absent from school for nearly three weeks when he was eventually discovered. When his mum, Esther Eketi-Mulo, died after suffering an epileptic fit, he was unable to fend for himself. Although staff had a contact number for his mum, they did not have any way of contacting other relatives.  Coroner Mary Hassell said that unless new rules were brought in, other children could die in a similar manner,  reported last year .   New rules introduced by the Department for Education say that schools and colleges must now have one emergency contact number per pupil, where reasonably possible.  Nadhim Zahawi, Minister for Children and Families, said:  “This was a truly tragic case. Schools and colleges play an important part in keeping children safe which is why have recently taken action to update guidance that all schools have on how to deal with concerns about a child.  This now includes a specific reference to ask that schools, where possible, hold more than one emergency contact number for each pupil.” It is thought Esther died on October 1 or 2, 2016, but she and her son were not found until October 20.  By that time Chadrack had been dead for around two days, as a result of dehydration and malnutrition. Neighbours at the Trelawney Estate in Hackney reportedly thought the stench coming from the family\u0027s flat was from the mum\u0027s cooking. Staff from his school, Morningside Primary, had visited the home twice and rang several times in early October but could not get in. Ms Hassell said: They ... could not gain access to the block of flats where Chadrack and his mother lived.

Teachers ruled Casey Healy\u0027s recent trim - which he got specially for his brother\u0027s communion - was against the Chelsea school\u0027s policy. The prestigious college requires boys\u0027 hair be neat, tidy and a uniform length all over - with Casey\u0027s undercut allegedly failing to adhere to the rule.  His mother, Charlotte Healy, said her son has been left upset and worried after being sent home from school because of his hair shortly after registration at around 9.10am on Tuesday, getwestlondon reports .  The mum-of-three said: “They said that it\u0027s against their school uniform policy.  “It wasn\u0027t a dramatic cut, it was just a little bit shaved and then longer on the top. But he was sent home because I\u0027ve already told them he isn\u0027t allowed to go into isolation. “He\u0027s come home scared and a bit worried over just a haircut. He has been [at the school] for three years, he has 100% attendance and his punctuality is 100%. “Casey hasn\u0027t gone back in today, so now he\u0027s missing more time off school, which he doesn\u0027t really need to be doing. He\u0027s got his GCSEs coming up. “I can\u0027t see how a haircut would affect his education. It wasn\u0027t dyed, it didn\u0027t have any lines or any patterns. I could understand if he had it spray painted or it was very extreme.”  The incident occurred at St Thomas More Language College on Tuesday. According to Miss Healy, 29, her son had his hair cut for his brother\u0027s communion on Sunday, which she explained to staff at St Thomas More school on Tuesday. She suggested the family would be “back in this predicament” in two weeks time because Casey has his confirmation, for which he needs to be neat and tidy for church. “I\u0027m considering moving him from the school, which obviously I don\u0027t want to. I don\u0027t really feel comfortable sending him back,” Miss Healy added. “To get into this school we\u0027ve had to go to church, we\u0027ve had to make sure that we are there every Sunday. He\u0027s had to become an altar boy and his attendance is 100%, he is clean and tidy. “It is just a simple shave with a bit cut on the side.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s ability to sell out everything from a \u0026pound175 Reiss dresses to those trademark pairs of nude LK Bennett pumps has caused a frenzy in the UK fashion industry. But now she has a rival in the new Duchess of Sussex, as experts predict Meghan Markle’s selling power could outshine even Kate’s appeal. And it’s not just Meghan’s fashion which could give the UK economy a boost – the American former actress has the added bonus of pulling in sales from her homeland across the Atlantic. So could the Markle Sparkle could take over the Kate effect...? KATE  FASHION It’s estimated that Kate pumps \u0026pound150million in revenue to the UK fashion industry every year, and her ability to sell out clothes is renowned. When her Sarah Burton wedding dress went on display at Buckingham Palace in the summer of 2011, approximately \u0026pound8m was raised for the Royal Collection.  Meanwhile, a \u0026pound38 Topshop dress she wore while pregnant with Prince George sold out within an hour of her wearing it to film studios.  And it’s not just luxury fashion and high street brands Kate helps promote. A \u0026pound10 bracelet in aid of Suffolk’s Treehouse Hospice sold out after the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one in 2012. BEAUTY Ever since it was reported that Trilogy Rosehip Oil is responsible for Kate’s glowing complexion, a bottle of the \u0026pound16.50 product started selling every 20 seconds.  But her bouncy, blow-dried brunette locks are the real source of her beauty branding power. When it was revealed that the Duchess is a fan of Richard Ward Cleanse and Condition Shampoo, the \u0026pound5.99 product sold out immediately in Waitrose.  Richard Ward is Kate’s hairdresser and \u0026pound325 appointments at his Knightsbridge salon have seen waiting lists extend to six months since she became royalty. LIFESTYLE Kate and Prince William’s beloved dog Lupo is a treasured addition to their family, and is regularly seen in official portraits. The Kennel Club attributed the raised profile and interest in English Cocker Spaniels to Lupo, following a 50% surge in searches for the breed on their website following their ownership of the dog.  Meanwhile, the royal couple love taking the kids to the French Alps and after they were pictured visiting luxury skiing resort Courchevel, bookings for the three nearest airports spiked with 57% more flights booked than over the same dates the previous year. KIDS Valuation firm Brand Finance estimates that Princess Charlotte adds \u0026pound101m to the UK economy each year, while her older brother Prince George adds \u0026pound76m. At just six months old, Charlotte proved she had the same selling power as her mother. The \u0026pound21 floral dress she wore a family portrait immediately sold out and its Spanish designer M\u0026ampH was inundated with orders from around the world.  Meanwhile, Prince George’s cuddly kangaroo backpack sold-out just hours after Prince William was spotted holding it during a trip to Sydney in 2014.  FASHION In the run up to the Royal Wedding, Meghan caused several independent Canadian websites to crash by wearing their brands, including Line The Label, which she wore for her official engagement photos. She caused a 400% increase in traffic to jewellery site Birks, and a 1000% increase in sales to sunglasses brand Finlay \u0026amp Co, just by wearing their products.  Since the Windsor ceremony on Saturday, there has been a 160% increase in searches for Stella McCartney wedding dresses – Meghan’s choice of designer for her evening gown. Richard Haigh, of Brand Finance, says the 36-year-old’s branding power will only continue to soar. “Following the wedding, we estimated that her brand power will be \u0026pound150m a year, which is the same as Kate’s,” says Richard. “Based on our estimate, she could pull in the same kind of brand potential as Kate for the fashion industry.”  Meghan’s appeal could surpass Kate’s at the beginning, as she boosts American as well as UK brands, Professor Jonathan Shalit, who runs InterTalent, says. “The Meghan journey has been a completely phenomenal, unique journey,” he says. “The power of Meghan is quite staggering. I think she could be the biggest fashion brand in the world.” But Jonathan says there may be a shift over time. “I think right now she is the new kid on the block, and Kate is a mother-of-three,” he explains. “But eventually when Meghan has been doing this for a few years, they will both even out.” BEAUTY Down-to-earth Meghan was praised for the natural make-up and “messy bun” she sported on her wedding day, with hundreds of websites rushing to advise others on how to copy her style.  Online beauty brand Memi announced a 65% rise in sales of nude lipsticks since Meghan wore a taupe hue during her engagement interview. She also loves \u0026pound7 Nivea’s Skin Firming Hydration Body Lotion to keep her skin moisturised. LIFESTYLE It’s no secret that the Duchess of Sussex loves keeping fit and healthy, reportedly converting Prince Harry to green juices and helping him quit smoking. She’s been pictured in a variety of yoga poses on her now defunct Instagram and loves running around Kensington Palace Green.  Since she was snapped in Kensington’s posh health shop Whole Foods, sales at organic independents and retailers have enjoyed a 9.7% sales jump to \u0026pound359m.  Meghan’s also partial to a glass of wine, noting that her favourite red is the full-bodied and firm Tignanello – which she even named her lifestyle blog ‘The Tig’ after. While the yoga and pilates business brings in \u0026pound812m into the UK economy a year, the new Duchess’s lifestyle choices could see an even greater spike in its popularity. Her wedding alone is predicted to have drawn in an additional \u0026pound500m to Britain’s economy through tourism, travel, hotels and memorabilia, according to Brand Nation. KIDS Friends of the royal couple revealed before their wedding on May 19 that the pair hope to have a baby within a year of getting married.  While there is no doubt that the youngsters would be of huge public interest, they may not attract quite the same frenzy as George and Charlotte, says Jonathan.

The plan could see obese office workers miss the rush hour commute, demand an extra large chair or even work from home. A UK government advisor will propose changes at the European Congress on Obesity in Vienna as new research shows Brits are among most fat-ist in Europe. Prof Stephen Bevan has advised the Department of Work and Pensions and is a member of Public Health England’s advisory board. He will tell 2,000 medics that obesity should be classed as a “protected characteristic” allowing staff to sue fat shaming bosses.  Prof Bevan, head of HR research at the Institute for Employment Studies, said: “We need to coordinate our efforts so that people who want to work can do so. “It can be working time, it can be having a bit of understanding that someone might need to turn up at 10am because they have trouble with transport or anxiety about transport. “Many employers get away with whatever they want.” Prof Bevan will present a systematic review of research in to obesity workplace discrimination.  It included a major study on “weight stigma” in the NHS .  Another study found one in five Brits said they would object to an obese person marrying in to their family.  A third study by the European Association for the Study of Obesity found more than half of UK doctors thought overweight patients lacked willpower.  One in three said they were too lazy to keep weight off.  Prof Bevan added: “Some people say that obesity is the last characteristic that its still socially acceptable to make fun of .  “We have a scheme in the UK called Access to Work which not many employers know about. “If you are an individual living with a health condition or an impairment you can get support, paid for by the Government to make accommodations. “It could be transport or it could be working from home.”  Another study surveyed 90,573 people in nine countries and found only 47% of Brits believe food addiction is a reasonable explanation. This was lowest other than the US and Germany.

Sidney and Reginald Cugullere left London with the Jules Rimet trophy following their audacious raid.  With every policeman in Britain on the lookout for the cup, the brothers hid it in a brick lean-to outside Reg’s father-in-law’s home. The shed, at 71 Cowper Street, Luton, has survived the last half century but is currently in a state of disrepair.  Its wooden door is etched with graffiti and it is currently being used to house a washing machine.  \u0027I\u0027m in the dark about villains\u0027: Owner of Pickles the dog has never heard of 1966 World Cup heist thief  Reg\u0027s son Gary said: “My dad and uncle panicked and hid the World Cup in my grandfather’s coal shed. My mum told me he didn’t know anything about it. They just sneaked the trophy in and left it there until they had figured out what to do with it.”   Seven days after the World Cup was stolen it was found in a hedge by Pickles the dog and owner David Corbett.  Months later the trophy was raised by Bobby Moore at Wembley after England defeated West Germany 4-2.  Gary says his dad Reg, who died in 2012, believed traces of coal would have been on the cup when it was held aloft. He said: If the police carried out a forensic examination they would have found coal dust. A Mirror investigation revealed how Sid nicked the trophy from a glass display cabinet at the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster.  His brother Reg then put the cup under the front seat of his car and drove North to Bedfordshire The Cugulleres then stashed the priceless trophy while they worked out how to return it to the FA.  Historic records show Reg\u0027s wife Betty was living at 71 Cowper Street when she married in 1945, and her mum Nora died there in 1962.  Council documents prove Betty\u0027s dad Norman \u0027Jack\u0027 White, who worked as a lorry driver, was still living at the same address in 1966. Both Sid and Reg confided in Gary that the coal shed was where they hid the trophy for several days. The dilapidated outbuilding is now used as a makeshift washing room.

Officers are hunting the driver of the grey Audi A3, which sped off after the horror smash in Edinburgh that left one person dead. The car, which had false number-plates and may have been used in other crimes in the city, was found abandoned in Fife a few hours later. The crash happened close to Maybury roundabout in Edinburgh at about 12.30am yesterday. Witnesses told how the Audi drove over chevron road markings to overtake a number of vehicles, including a bus. It headed on to the oncoming carriageway, causing a BMW to swerve and hit a Peugeot 206, which was travelling in the opposite direction. Emergency services, including 14 firefighters, scrambled to the scene. It is understood fire crews initially believed every driver and passenger had been accounted for – but a victim was later discovered in the wreckage of the Peugeot, which had burst into flames. The BMW’s occupants – a 25-year-old man, 22-year-old woman and five-year-old girl – were all taken to hospital, where they continued to be treated for their injuries last night. The Audi was recovered in Lochgelly Road, Cowdenbeath – near to the local ambulance depot – at about 3.50am. It had been stolen from the Liberton area of Edinburgh on April 17.

Her parents had been told there was next to no hope that she\u0027d live when the abnormality was picked up at a nine-week scan. Mum Naomi Findlay, 31, and dad Dean Wilkins, 43, were advised to terminate the pregnancy but she refused and never gave up hope.  Vanellope\u0027s breast bone had failed to develop normally, causing her heart and part of her stomach to grow on the outside. The condition - called ectopia cordis - is extremely rare and most babies affected have a less than 10 per cent chance of survival. There were only a handful of cases worldwide where a baby has survived the condition and none in Britain. A team of 50 staff were on hand to assist when Vanellope was born by c-section at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester weighing 4lb 7oz at 9.50am on November 22 last year.  Six months on, she is still making an incredible recovery and has now been moved nearer to her family\u0027s home in Bullwell, Notts. She was transported from Leicester Royal Infirmary to Nottingham\u0027s Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham on Thursday. Her day-to-day care will today move to the medical team at Nottingham University Hospitals who will prepare her for going home in the coming weeks. Naomi spoke of her excitement and said she is looking forward to finally getting her baby home.  She added: “I started this journey, what seems like a long time ago now, when I had a scan at nine weeks pregnant. “There have been times when I really didn’t think she would make it, but she has fought so hard. I have been so incredibly lucky to have been surrounded by an amazing medical team. “It has been very hard for me and my other children over the last six months. “I have felt torn between my children, guilty when I am at home with my boys and then guilty when I’m in hospital with Vanellope, so this will be a huge relief and we will start to feel like a real family.

The man and woman were spotted getting rid of bricks and stones by the side of a road. But passer-by - a builder - was having none of it, and filmed what happened on his mobile phone. The video footage of their exchange shows him telling them: Put it back in your car and take it home, you scruffy f***ers! He refused to leave until every last bit of debris was put back into the car. The builder, who asked not to be named, said: I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.  It\u0027s disgusting that people think they can go dumping their rubbish on other people\u0027s land - how would they like it in their back garden? There\u0027s absolutely no excuse for it and I wasn\u0027t going to let them get away with it. I had to put a stop to it. The clip shows him pulling up and confronting the pair dumping rubbish on a farmer\u0027s field near Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The builder can be heard asking what are you doing? before the couple seem to try and justify leaving the waste at the side of the road. But he refuses to let the matter, and shouts: Pick it all up and put it back in your car and take it home.  Go on hurry up. You don\u0027t throw it in someone else\u0027s field do you? How would you like it if I thew a load of s*** in your garden? He asks the couple why they don\u0027t take the waste to the tip and when they claim it\u0027s closed, he says: Go tomorrow then! On a number of occasions, the couple can be seen on video trying to apologise for their actions but the builder has no sympathy for them and forces them to carry on picking up their waste. After loading dozens of bricks back into their vehicle, he insists they also move some building rubble dumped at the side of the road. The pair claim the waste isn\u0027t theirs - until the man gets out of his work van and points out it must be as it\u0027s bone dry when it\u0027s pouring down with rain.  Take it to the tip like everyone else, or buy a skip, the builder says. He continues filming the pair as the woman puts on a pair of gloves and fills a black bin bag with rubble, which they load back into their dark blue people carrier. Before they drive away, the couple ask the builder to delete the recording of them fly tipping but he refuses, saying you\u0027ve just been flytipping, I\u0027m going to wait here until you\u0027ve gone. Speaking afterwards, the builder who works from a site nearby, said: It\u0027s just not acceptable. I know there was a bit of f-ing and blinding from me but that\u0027s not a crime. They were fly tipping which is illegal. People are always leaving stuff there - sofas, chairs, building stuff, you name it - but I don\u0027t know what right they think they have.  I don\u0027t understand why they don\u0027t just take it to a tip, it doesn\u0027t cost them anything. I have a works vehicle so I can\u0027t do that and have to pay \u0026pound200 to hire a skip, they\u0027re just being lazy. The builder said there is a refuse tip just ten minutes from the layby where he caught the fly tippers - and claims he followed the couple along a road just a mile or so from it after the incident. He has had a largely positive response form the video, which he says he took to encourage others to step in and stop others fly tipping. I want people to know they\u0027re within their rights to hold people to account. It\u0027s not OK for people to fly tip.

The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for southern England for today, tomorrow and Sunday and say heavy showers will hit. Forecasters have warned there is a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded, with damage to some buildings from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds this weekend. The thundery showers in places will be mixed with warm sunny spells. Tonight there will be rain across some central parts becoming more sporadic overnight, still with some heavy bursts at times, the Met Office forecasts. Clear spells and patchy fog will be seen elsewhere, but further showers will hit southern England by dawn, perhaps turning heavy and thundery. Saturday is set for scattered downpours with hail pushing into the south, with warm sunshine in between.  Many northern areas will be fine and very warm, after early rain clears Northern England, the Met Office added. Forecasters are warning that, once the rain clears, it could be the hottest early May Bank Holiday weekend ever with temperatures hitting 30C. It will be warmest in the South East but the rest of the UK will experience glorious sunshine as well. The previous record set in late May was 32.8C, which was recorded in Horsham in 1944 on a Monday.  Martin Young, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “There is a 50/50 chance we may see the warmest day of the year so far at some point towards the end of the weekend.” If the temperatures do break 30C it will also make it the warmest day of the year, beating with 29.1C taken on April 19 in St. James Park, London. But before it heats up motorists looking to get away today are at risk of heavy rain and thunderstorms. Saturday will be sunny for most, but with the risk of sharp showers for central and southern areas. The heaviest and most widespread showers are expected over south-west England, especially in the afternoon.  Sunday will be sunny for many northern and eastern parts, although there will be thundery showers again for central and southern portions of Britain. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Andy Page added: “There is a risk of potentially severe thunderstorms during the Bank Holiday weekend. Saturday: Rain in northern England will ease to leave many fine and very warm. Southern and southwestern areas will see further thundery showers, whilst coasts in northeast Scotland could remain misty. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Very warm over the Bank Holiday weekend with plenty of sunshine, especially in the northwest. Scattered thunderstorms in the south, especially on Sunday. Mist returning to eastern coasts from Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"why me need help stop","story":"News\u0027Why me?

Sophie Lionnet, 21, was starved, beaten, whipped with a cable and left with a broken chestbone ribs before being drowned in a bath. Her killers Sabrina Kouider, 35, and partner Ouissem Medouni, 40, were yesterday found guilty of murder. Police found a note written by a starving Sophie in the tiny, dark room where she was forced to sleep. It read simply: Why me? I need help to stop them. The victim\u0027s dad Patrick Lionnet, 56, told The Times: I will never hear her say \u0027daddy, I\u0027m getting married\u0027 or \u0027daddy, I\u0027m going to have a baby\u0027.  Those people are not human, they are barbaric. They have no humanity in them at all. And her mum Catherine Devallonne, 49, said: They took away her dignity and finally her life painfully ebbed away, until Sophie struggled to take her last breath in that bath. Kouider and Medouni had a twisted obsession with Boyzone founder Mark Walton, Kouider\u0027s ex, and wrongly accused Miss Lionnet of conspiring with him. Her burnt body was eventually found on the couple\u0027s patio when firefighters were called to reports of foul-smelling smoke. In chilling audio recordings, captured on Kouider\u0027s phone, they could be heard firing questions at their terrified victim during the interrogation sessions, which took place over 12 days before her murder.  The violent questioning was conducted by the duo in a bid to force the nanny to confess to various false crimes. In the weeks leading up to her death in September last year, the couple beat, starved and tortured the shy 21-year-old by dunking her head into water. Having killed her in the bath, the pair threw her on a bonfire in the garden of their home near Wimbledon, south-west London, as they barbecued chicken nearby. The body was discovered when firefighters were alerted by neighbours to pungent-smelling smoke, but Medouni tried to pass off the charred remains as a sheep. And Kouider claimed to police that Miss Lionnet had run off with ex-byofriend Mr Walton in an attempt to frame him for her disappearance.  The defendants later admitted disposing of her body but denied Miss Lionnet\u0027s murder, blaming each other for her death. An Old Bailey jury found both of them guilty of the murder following a two-month trial that was described as stranger than fiction. Miss Lionnet\u0027s parents travelled from France to see the disturbing evidence as it unfolded. The court heard how fashion designer Kouider was fixated with her ex-boyfriend Mr Walton. After splitting up after two years, Kouider reported him to police more than 30 times and received a caution for branding him a paedophile on a fake Facebook profile.  She also accused him of sexually abusing a cat, using black magic and hiring a helicopter to spy on her. Giving evidence, LA-based Mr Walton said he had been in love with Kouider but she would flip and go crazy for no reason. Another ex-boyfriend Anthony Francois described her as a lunatic, fickle and unstable. Jurors heard more than eight hours of recordings in which Miss Lionnet was slapped, likened to a Nazi collaborator and called worse than a murderer by her tormentors. Kouider, who claimed to know influential people including US President Donald Trump, threatened to have her locked up and even marched her to a police station.  The victim\u0027s distraught mother had begged Kouider to send her daughter home but she refused. In her final days, Miss Lionnet was hit with an electrical cable and beaten so badly she had five broken ribs and a cracked breast bone. In a filmed forced confession, the emaciated and broken young woman claimed she had drugged Medouni so Mr Walton could sexually assault him. Within hours, she was dead. Before the trial, Medouni claimed Miss Lionnet died by accident after he punched her during an interrogation in the bath. He offered to admit manslaughter but later retracted his confession, saying he made it to protect his wife, who has been diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder.

Bizarre theories have circulated online that it could be a werewolf, a young grizzly bear or even a relative of Bigfoot. After inspecting the creature wolf experts have said they doubt it\u0027s a wolf as its teeth are too short, front paws abnormally small and claws too large. The animal came to the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks attention last week after a rancher shot it dead when it came within several hundred metres of his livestock in Denton, Montana.   FWP spokesman Bruce Auchly said it was a young, non-lactating female and a canid, a member of the dog family that includes dogs , foxes, coyotes and wolves.  He added: We have no idea what this was until we get a DNA report back. Theories over what the animal could be have ranged from a coywolf - a coyote wolf hybrid- or perhaps a wolfdog bred in captivity and later released into the wild. Other suggested it could be a legendary Chupacabra but it is too far north for that.  One thing is for sure though - experts are not accepting as a wolf just yet - and DNA test results are not expected back for weeks.  Ty Smucker, wolf management specialist for Montana FWP, told the Great Falls Tribune : Several things grabbed my attention when I saw the pictures,  The ears are too big. The legs look a little short. The feet look a little small, and the coat looks weird. There\u0027s just something off about it.

The neglected building has been abandoned for years, but new pictures have emerged which show how it may be a going concern again. Stunning snaps show a column of lights scaling the full height of the notorious Ryugyong Hotel, culminating in an enormous LED display of the North Korean flag. The development comes as Kim Jong-un\u0027s secretive state attempts to build a world level beach resort in the coastal city of Wonsan in a bid to attract more tourists. Construction of the sinister-looking hotel began way back in 1987, and was supposed to open in 1989.  Had it finished on time, it would have been the tallest hotel in the world. Construction then stopped in 1992 as North Korea entered a period of economic crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Photographer Philippe Daniel snapped the lights at the 105-storey skyscraper during a visit last month and was told they had been added only two weeks earlier. He said: There are two vertical lines of lights at the front of the hotel, those lights are moving upwards from the bottom to the top, colours shifting between blue and red. The tip of the hotel has a 360-degree LED panel showing an animated North Korean flag waving.   These aren\u0027t the highest resolution panels they could have used - you can still clearly see the pixels - but they\u0027re still impressive, especially when seen from the front with the vertical lights.  In the day, it doesn\u0027t look like there are any LED panels up there...  It must be individual LEDs embedded in the facade. French-born Mr Daniel, who now lives in Singapore, said his North Korean chaperons weren\u0027t keen to discuss the building, but there was no escaping it. It seemed like the guides didn\u0027t wanted to talk much about it, the 29-year-old said. But you can see it from everywhere. It\u0027s kind of the first thing you can see of Pyongyang, even from afar. I think it became more like a piece of the propaganda rather than a functional hotel.

scott fraser","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlaymaker Scott Fraser looks set for a switch to England after announcing he’s quitting Dundee United.Burton Albion, looking to rebuild after relegation from the Championship down south, now seem the 23-year-old’s most likely destination.The Tangerines announced last night that Fraser had rejected their offer of a lucrative new deal and would be pursuing other options.He’s been speaking to a number of clubs in England and there has even been interest from abroad.For the past month or so Hearts have appeared to be leading the race for Fraser and their first-team coach, ex-Tannadice favourite Jon Daly, has watched him on several occasions.Burton, managed by Nigel Clough, have now jumped to the front of the queue.They’re expected to beat off that interest from Tynecastle as well as offers from English rivals Peterborough and Blackpool, to get Fraser fixed up.Accepting the player’s decision to go, manager Csaba Laszlo stressed United had fought hard to hang on to him.“We did everything we could to keep Scott at the club,” he said.“He is a gifted player and we made him a very good offer to stay with us.“He is a great example to young players of the pathway that is open to them in professional football and I have no doubt he will do very well in the future.“We know that good players will attract attention and, for this reason, we are already at an advanced stage in replacing Scott and a number of the other players that left at the end of the season.”Fraser himself made it clear after over a decade at Tannadice he felt the time to move to pastures new had come.His big regret is the broken foot that’s plagued him since early last year prevented him doing more to help in the battle to get back to the Premiership.He first broke it at St Mirren in March 2017 and did it again at the same venue when United lost there at the end of December.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank the club for everything they have done for me over the past 12 years.“When I joined the academy back in 2006 I could only dream of making over 100 appearances.“Unfortunately, my last season was the most frustrating I have ever had with the injury and I am gutted we couldn’t achieve promotion.“Thanks to all my team-mates, coaches and managers over the years.“I now feel the time is right for me to move on in order to improve as a player by playing at the highest level I possibly can.“Thanks again and good luck for next season.”Meanwhile, Graeme Liveston, who for many years was in charge of United’s youth recruitment in the west coast, could be set for a return to Tannadice as part of the shake-up to the youth set-up that’s taking place this summer.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b07c93c9b9b5-e1527253316470.jpg ","title":"council apologise after staff lock dundee pensioner in

and wander around the city’s ancient Howff.After spending some time on a bench in the western end of the graveyard he got up to leave at around 6pm on Wednesday.However, the northern exit at Meadowside had been padlocked shut.A quick check of the other exit revealed it had also been locked.Mr Stewart said he could not find a number to call anywhere and considered phoning the emergency services.He said: “I had been inside since 3pm and I was just wandering around the gravestones, which I often do.“It was around 20 minutes from the moment I realised I was locked in until I was freed.“I would have thought the area should be checked before it was locked up.“I’m annoyed that I was trapped.”Mr Stewart eventually managed to grab the attention of a good Samaritan who called the chairman of the Dundee Howff Conservation Group, Simon Goulding.He said Mr Goulding told him it was the first time he had ever heard of someone being locked in the grounds.Mr Stewart added: “It was a

has welcomed a host of new restaurants in recent years – and one of its most famous streets could be set for a food boom.Much like the Waterfront, Reform Street – previously considered the city’s answer to Savile Row – is in the midst of a transformation.The street has been maligned for many years, with many empty units blighting the once bustling thoroughfare.But several planning applications have been put forward for new eateries to join the others that have arrived in the street in recent years.Project Pizza (previously Project Pie), German Doner Kebab and Asian-themed restaurant Dai Pai have proved popular destinations.John Brandon, manager at Project Pizza, said he was encouraged by the latest applications and believes the restaurant trade could hold the key to reviving the street’s fortunes.He said: “When we first opened it was great, we had a great flow of customers.“There has been something of a steady decline in the last year or so but it’s good to see there have been quite a few applications put forward.“I don’t know if it’s the case that people’s tastes are changing and we’re in competition with other parts of the city which are seeing more footfall.“I think the restaurant sector is where we’re going to see a big difference in Reform Street.“You’ve got the shopping centres nearby, so I think if it’s turned into almost like a food court set-up with lots of different options then that could really give us a boost.”Permission has been granted by city planning chiefs to convert the former Swinton Insurance shop at 37 Reform Street into a coffee shop and takeaway.The Little Things Cafe will offer hot drinks and baked treats such as cupcakes and macaroons, along with paninis, soup and sandwiches.Lisa Shek, who submitted the application, said the menu could later expand into “Asian baked products”.In August, the Tele reported that listed building consent had been granted for an application to open an independent Scottish-themed diner.Plans were put forward to create 20-25 jobs at the eatery at the former Jessops camera shop.The restaurant would deliver “traditional and contemporary Scottish cuisine”, according to documents submitted to council chiefs.Mr Brandon envisages even more interest in restaurants as the overhaul of Dundee’s Waterfront progresses.He added: “As far as I’m concerned, the more restaurants the better.“It helps everyone if there are different businesses and options, so that could help it become the place to be for food.“I think we’re going to see a difference in the future once things start to come together with the V\u0026ampA and the Waterfront.“I do think they should be investing in Reform Street to try to clean it up and make it a lot more attractive.“We’ve got a lot of empty units at the moment but it’s good that people are at least prepared to try to open up new places down here.”Community figures and councillors have regularly called for out-of-the-box thinking to fulfil Reform Street’s potential.Alison Henderson, chief executive of Dundee and Angus Chamber of Commerce, believes there is a growing trend for people to look for things to do in the city centre.She said: “Whether it’s going to The McManus or coming out of the office at lunchtime for a coffee, independent businesses are great for the city, and its centre, so it’s absolutely to be welcomed.“Hopefully people will support the street and it will get the footfall that it needs.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b05375707da0-e1527072047490-709x564.jpg ","title":"fraser fyvie tipped to be main dundee united man by ex star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt’s going to be a summer of signings for Dundee United as they attempt to build a squad capable of getting out of the Championship.As many as 17 new faces from goalkeepers to strikers are expected to come through the doors at Tannadice as manager Csaba Laszlo, aided by club legend Paul Sturrock, completely revamp the home dressing-room.That’s likely to see a mix of youth and experience as well as some exciting talent arriving right up until the end of the transfer window in August.One United old boy, though, believes Laszlo and Luggy might already have made their most important signing.The former player is Stuart Duff and the capture he believes could be more significant than any other is that of existing employee Fraser Fyvie.The midfielder’s campaign in the season just ended was ruined by a knee problem suffered at Christmas. Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Sbro_Viridor_Fire_Perth-8.jpg.jpg ","title":"lithium ion batteries may have

costs could soar to over 20m","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe price of Dundee’s planned new stadium development could soar to well over £20 million due to access requirements.But while original estimates of the cost to build “Nou Campy” are understood to have been between £15m and £18m, the Dark Blues will plough ahead with the project they hope to complete by 2020.A site between Camperdown Park and the city’s Ice Arena has been earmarked for the state-of-the-art facility that would include training pitches, a retail park and housing development.The fact it’s also adjacent to the Kingsway, however, means close scrutiny is being paid to how it would be accessed.Transport Scotland, the body responsible for the country’s trunk roads, require certain conditions to be met before they’ll give their blessing.Best case scenario would be for a new slip road to be included, meaning costs could be kept to a minimum.The stumbling block with that would be traffic only being able to enter and exit on the northbound carriageway of the A90.If that meant a new junction had to be constructed to allow access for south-bound vehicles, the increase in cost would run well into seven figures.Talks between the club and Transport Scotland have already taken place but the authority will only give their verdict once they’ve received detailed proposals.“Road safety is of paramount importance for everyone that will use the stadium, the associated commercial developments and the wider road network,” said a spokesman.“We’re working with the developer to get absolute clarity on their proposals and the

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).
