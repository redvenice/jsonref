I think it\u0027s a combination of both things.Wanda Barzee, 72, is pictured for the FIRST TIME since her...Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 31, exhibits her model figure in...Big Brother: Lewis Gregory can\u0027t hide his delight as he...Share this article\u0027That kind of a message, it might not be for everybody. But there is a group of people for whom that message is designed. And nothing fills my soul more than to think that maybe some kid watching that would say, \u0027Hey, I\u0027ve been thinking about that. I\u0027ve been thinking about praying. Let me try that out.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s like the only way I feel like I can repay what has essentially been a giant gift in my life.\u0027Top honor: On Monday, Chris Pratt, 38, received the MTV Movie \u0026amp TV Generation AwardPratt dismissed the idea that talking so openly about his faith, particularity at a non-religious event, could be a risk in Hollywood. \u0027I think that there\u0027s this narrative that exists out there that Hollywood is anti-Christian or anti-religious, but it\u0027s just not the case,\u0027 he said.\u0027They are kind of not anti-anything. They are kind of pro whatever is authentic to you. \u0027And I like that. Because it\u0027s authentic for me to be pro-Christian, pro-Jesus. That\u0027s my thing. I like it. \u0027And I\u0027ve never had anyone try to shame me, to my face. Maybe they go say it behind my back. But if that\u0027s the case, go ahead. You can say whatever you want about me - to my face or behind my back. I\u0027m not going to change.\u0027Aside from his Christianity, Pratt said that exercise way a major motivator in his life.     The couple that exercise together: Chris Pratt, 39, and girlfriend  Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28, were spotted out for a walk on a sunny Saturday in Los Angeles           Old love: Chris with his wife of eight years, actress Anna Faris, and their son Jack, six , at his Hollywood star ceremony in 2017. They filed for orce last DecemberThe interview with The Associated Press, took place after Michelob Ultra, which Pratt is a spokesman for, announced it was sponsoring seven athletes with disabilities, part of the nonprofit group Achilles International, to run in the New York City Marathon. \u0027It\u0027s hard enough to do a marathon or to do a triathlon. But to do it when you have physical limitations and disabilities, it\u0027s pretty awe-inspiring,\u0027 he said, adding that fitness is \u0027a great common denominator.\u0027The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state, says that he feels he was \u0027genetically made for... moving refrigerators or something.\u0027\u0027But now I\u0027m doing a job that really isn\u0027t that physically demanding. So having something that I can just shut my mind off and do physically every day is good for me.\u0027The Jurassic World actor added that he is a little self-conscious about his running skills, after breaking his leg as a child left one of his legs crooked, and so he was in awe of actors like Tom Cruise who could sprint flawlessly on screen and did their own stunts.\u0027When I run, I run a little crooked. And if I run at top speed, there\u0027s a high likelihood I will fall down,\u0027 he said.\u0027Tom Cruise. \u0027Mission: Impossible\u0027 - he ran across London, across bridges, over buildings. Yeah, Tom is a great runner. He did all his own jumping, he was flying the helicopter, he really was like - oh, if there\u0027s a question of whether or not I\u0027m the best at this, let me put that question to bed. He\u0027s the best.\u0027But it was Cruise\u0027s reputation that Pratt said he most admired.          The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state          Pratt has erected crosses on his land \u0027One of the career goals that I have based on Tom Cruise is his reputation as being a really nice, positive guy who works hard. I\u0027ve never actually met him, but I would like - if you\u0027re going to leave a legacy, it\u0027d be nice to have it be that people thought you were nice and easy to work with and you worked hard. I think that\u0027s pretty cool.\u0027Prat split from his wife Anna Faris last year, but has found love again in Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28.They came out as a couple in June and have been spotted enjoying a sunny Saturday day in Los Angeles last weekend.Proving that couple that exercises together stays together, they enjoyed a walk. At one point the beautiful 28-year-old daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his ex-wife Maria Shriver reached out to lovingly stroke her beau\u0027s arm. Chris and Katherine are reportedly serious, a source dished to People, even though they\u0027ve only been together a few months \u0027They\u0027re both serious about the relationship and hopeful for the future,\u0027 the source revealed. \u0027Chris doesn\u0027t just date to date, and neither does Katherine. She\u0027s very excited.\u0027 They were set up by her mom Maria, according to the source.The actor split from wife Anna Faris in August 2017 after being married for eight years and they share six-year-old son Jack.  He filed for orce on December 1, nearly four months after they announced their legal separation. Three days later Anna filed her nearly identical response. They both cited irreconcilable differences and requested joint legal and physical custody of their son, according to E!

Onset for the disease is usually 65 and older.There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease currently, though various medication and management strategies may help to alleviate symptoms on a temporary basis. Not much is known about the cause of the disease, though about 70 percent of the risk is believed to be genetic. Other risk factors are believed to be hypertension, depression and head injuries.Named after German pathologist and psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer in 1906, the disease currently impacts approximately 29.8 million people worldwide as of 2015.Take That tour 2019: Band reveal Greatest Hits Live tour dates and Rick Astley as a special guest Daredevil season 3: All we know so far about the Netflix seriesMac Miller albums re-enter the Billboard 200 chart after rapper\u0027s death Who is Suge Knight?

He\u0027s another one of those curious, privileged, privately educated, posh Lefties who surround Corbyn. Dad was a stockbroker and banker, and mum was the daughter of a Tory MP.Murray himself has been involved in hardline Left-wing politics his entire adult life and is widely considered to be an apologist for Stalin. He\u0027s viscerally anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian and a supporter of North Korea.Currently, as well as advising Corbyn, he also serves as chief-of-staff to Labour\u0027s paymaster \u0027Red Len\u0027 McCluskey at the Unite trade union.He has worked for the Communist Morning Star newspaper — the Corbynistas\u0027 news outlet of choice — and during the Eighties was employed by the Soviet Novosti news agency.As to whether he\u0027s a former Communist, all I can say is that in my days as a labour and industrial correspondent, I knew quite a few former Communists. They were mostly old sweats who had left the party when they grew up, especially after the Russian invasions of Hungary in the Fifties and Czechoslovakia in 1968.Murray was still a member of the Communist Party until a couple of years ago, more than a quarter of a century after the Berlin Wall came down.Even if he\u0027s no longer a cardcarrying member, he has more in common with his old comrades than with most mainstream Labour MPs and supporters.He says he has no links to Moscow, but backed Putin over the shooting down of that Malaysian airliner and the annexation of Crimea, and has appeared on the Russian-bankrolled RT television channel. Could that be why the Ukrainian authorities branded him part of Putin\u0027s \u0027global propaganda network\u0027?Murray is joined at the hip to Corbyn\u0027s communications chief Seumas Milne, the privately educated son of a former BBC director-general, and another notable Soviet sympathiser. Like so many other committed socialists, Milne sent his children to selective grammar schools.          Murray is joined at the hip to Corbyn\u0027s communications chief Seumas Milne, the privately educated son of a former BBC director-generalMurray and Milne started out in agitprop politics in the Seventies and although Milne never joined the Communist Party — he joined The Guardian instead, which is almost the same thing — they share a warped, Wolfie Smith worldview which hasn\u0027t changed much in four decades.That both have found a comfortable berth in Corbyn\u0027s inner circle is yet more confirmation of just how far Labour\u0027s centre of gravity has shifted to the extreme Left.There has been much excitement recently over the reheated revelations about the late Labour leader Michael Foot being a paid agent of the KGB.True or not, these days Moscow doesn\u0027t have to pay those at the top of the Labour Party for support. Labour\u0027s ruling politiburo is already simpatico.A sweat-drenched nightmare for too-trusting PM: The Salzburg...Share this articleCorbyn even refused to accept the Russians were responsible for the Salisbury poisonings without \u0027incontrovertible\u0027 proof, and called for samples of the nerve agent Novichok to be sent to Moscow for analysis.It is impossible not to believe that Milne and Murray were 100 per cent behind their leader\u0027s stance and involved in formulating it.The idea of Corbyn becoming PM is terrifying. So is the prospect of hardliners like Murray and Milne occupying sensitive positions in 10 Downing Street.Murray might claim the intelligence services are plotting to prevent that happening, but given the way the Tories are tearing themselves apart over Mother Theresa\u0027s botched handling of Brexit, who would bet against Corbyn coming to power?It would be the most Left-wing government in British history, with the potential to cause untold damage at home and abroad.If the Funny People are getting jittery, be honest — can you blame them?  It\u0027s Pinky and very Perky! It\u0027s official. Bert and Ernie are not gay, they\u0027re just good friends. Speculation about their sexuality has been raging for almost 50 years.But Sesame Street\u0027s producers insist that although they have human traits and identify as men, they are not homosexual. They are, in fact, puppets.That may come as some consolation to the Belfast bakers who were prosecuted in 2015 for refusing to make a Bert and Ernie cake promoting gay marriage.Now the Bert and Ernie question has been cleared up, LGBT campaigners may turn their attention to other potential role models in the puppet world.Will Pinky and Perky be forced to come out of the closet? What about Zig and Zag? Perhaps one of them can be persuaded to transition. And, to be honest, I\u0027ve long had my doubts about Bill and Ben, the Flowerpot Men.Flobadob!          Earlier this week it was suggested that Bert and Ernie from the Muppets (pictured) were homosexual  Well, that was a complete waste of time, wasn\u0027t it?

He\u0027s another one of those curious, privileged, privately educated, posh Lefties who surround Corbyn. Dad was a stockbroker and banker, and mum was the daughter of a Tory MP.Murray himself has been involved in hardline Left-wing politics his entire adult life and is widely considered to be an apologist for Stalin. He\u0027s viscerally anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian and a supporter of North Korea.Currently, as well as advising Corbyn, he also serves as chief-of-staff to Labour\u0027s paymaster \u0027Red Len\u0027 McCluskey at the Unite trade union.He has worked for the Communist Morning Star newspaper — the Corbynistas\u0027 news outlet of choice — and during the Eighties was employed by the Soviet Novosti news agency.As to whether he\u0027s a former Communist, all I can say is that in my days as a labour and industrial correspondent, I knew quite a few former Communists. They were mostly old sweats who had left the party when they grew up, especially after the Russian invasions of Hungary in the Fifties and Czechoslovakia in 1968.Murray was still a member of the Communist Party until a couple of years ago, more than a quarter of a century after the Berlin Wall came down.Even if he\u0027s no longer a cardcarrying member, he has more in common with his old comrades than with most mainstream Labour MPs and supporters.He says he has no links to Moscow, but backed Putin over the shooting down of that Malaysian airliner and the annexation of Crimea, and has appeared on the Russian-bankrolled RT television channel. Could that be why the Ukrainian authorities branded him part of Putin\u0027s \u0027global propaganda network\u0027?Murray is joined at the hip to Corbyn\u0027s communications chief Seumas Milne, the privately educated son of a former BBC director-general, and another notable Soviet sympathiser. Like so many other committed socialists, Milne sent his children to selective grammar schools.          Murray is joined at the hip to Corbyn\u0027s communications chief Seumas Milne, the privately educated son of a former BBC director-generalMurray and Milne started out in agitprop politics in the Seventies and although Milne never joined the Communist Party — he joined The Guardian instead, which is almost the same thing — they share a warped, Wolfie Smith worldview which hasn\u0027t changed much in four decades.That both have found a comfortable berth in Corbyn\u0027s inner circle is yet more confirmation of just how far Labour\u0027s centre of gravity has shifted to the extreme Left.There has been much excitement recently over the reheated revelations about the late Labour leader Michael Foot being a paid agent of the KGB.True or not, these days Moscow doesn\u0027t have to pay those at the top of the Labour Party for support. Labour\u0027s ruling politiburo is already simpatico.A sweat-drenched nightmare for too-trusting PM: The Salzburg...Share this articleCorbyn even refused to accept the Russians were responsible for the Salisbury poisonings without \u0027incontrovertible\u0027 proof, and called for samples of the nerve agent Novichok to be sent to Moscow for analysis.It is impossible not to believe that Milne and Murray were 100 per cent behind their leader\u0027s stance and involved in formulating it.The idea of Corbyn becoming PM is terrifying. So is the prospect of hardliners like Murray and Milne occupying sensitive positions in 10 Downing Street.Murray might claim the intelligence services are plotting to prevent that happening, but given the way the Tories are tearing themselves apart over Mother Theresa\u0027s botched handling of Brexit, who would bet against Corbyn coming to power?It would be the most Left-wing government in British history, with the potential to cause untold damage at home and abroad.If the Funny People are getting jittery, be honest — can you blame them?  It\u0027s Pinky and very Perky! It\u0027s official. Bert and Ernie are not gay, they\u0027re just good friends. Speculation about their sexuality has been raging for almost 50 years.But Sesame Street\u0027s producers insist that although they have human traits and identify as men, they are not homosexual. They are, in fact, puppets.That may come as some consolation to the Belfast bakers who were prosecuted in 2015 for refusing to make a Bert and Ernie cake promoting gay marriage.Now the Bert and Ernie question has been cleared up, LGBT campaigners may turn their attention to other potential role models in the puppet world.Will Pinky and Perky be forced to come out of the closet? What about Zig and Zag? Perhaps one of them can be persuaded to transition. And, to be honest, I\u0027ve long had my doubts about Bill and Ben, the Flowerpot Men.Flobadob!          Earlier this week it was suggested that Bert and Ernie from the Muppets (pictured) were homosexual  Well, that was a complete waste of time, wasn\u0027t it? What else did Mother Theresa expect?The other EU states were never going to swallow her Chequers sell-out. They still cling to the hope that Britain can be humiliated into reversing the referendum result.She was only given ten minutes to present her vision of Brexit, which they contemptuously rejected out of hand, as their negotiators said they would. Chequers is dead in the water. Instead of crawling back to Brussels in the vain hope that some kind of shoddy compromise can be cobbled together, she should simply tell them we\u0027re leaving in March on WTO terms and they won\u0027t be getting a penny of the £39 billion orce payment she foolishly offered upfront.Just walk away, Mrs May."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/20/12/02EA8215000007D0-0-image-m-50_1537441855629.jpg","title":"Natwest online mobile banking goes down","story":"    NatWest customers complained that they had been unable to use their cash cards in ATMs in a new IT meltdown           RBS boss Ross McEwan (right) was on LBC with Nick Ferrari today where he apologised to the millions affected by the IT glitch          NatWest\u0027s internet banking and app went down today leaving millions without access to their accounts          This customer has been warned she will face fees unless her overdraft is cleared - but could not get into her accountMr McEwan was on LBC today to talk about the bank and Brexit but was taken to task over the online banking problems. One listener asked him if the bonuses of those in charge of IT would lose their bonuses.Mr McEwan said: \u0027If we docked people every time something went wrong you\u0027d have an organisation where nothing would change.

The euro has also lost ground against the US dollar, indicating that this current impasse helps neither the UK nor the EU.\u0027The pound has now given up gains it made this week on the back of a higher-than-expected inflation figure and strong retail sales data.                                                    \u0027We\u0027ve been rebuffed on our plans without any coherent explanation as to why, there\u0027s these sort of rather dogmatic pleas to the single market unity but our plans were very carefully crafted around that,\u0027 he said. He added: \u0027We\u0027re going to hold our nerve, stay calm and keep negotiating in good faith. \u0027We\u0027ve revved up the motor of these negotiations, I\u0027ve been out there a lot more frequently to get motoring, to make progress and the EU have just yanked up the handbrake and for the negotiations to go forward they\u0027re going to have to take their hand off the handbrake.\u0027 He said Mrs May was \u0027a very stoic, resilient character\u0027.The British retort reflected anger from both Brexiteers and Remainers at the sabre-rattling behaviour from leaders in Salzburg yesterday.French president Emmanuel Macron sparked particular outrage when he gloated that turmoil in negotiations will teach Britons not to listen to \u0027liars\u0027 about how easy it would be to leave.Tory former minister Stephen Crabb, a Remainer in the referendum, voiced anger at the way they had tried to \u0027belittle\u0027 the PM.\u0027The manner in which they sought to belittle and put down the Prime Minister yesterday pushes people like me... into a position where we say the quicker we\u0027re out of this circus, the better,\u0027 he said. Conservative MP Hugo Swire said: \u0027If this is a negotiating ploy by Macron, Merkel and Tusk, they have seriously overestimated Theresa May\u0027s room to manoeuvre back in the UK.\u0027Ex-Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said the EU leaders had behaved \u0027appalling\u0027 and had \u0027got personal\u0027.\u0027Monsieur Macron is not only out of order, he\u0027s completely wrong. The EU is doing their classic case of trying to bully the UK in a variety of ways into taking a different position,\u0027 he told the Guardian.\u0027The honest truth is I don\u0027t get involved in his domestic politics and therefore he should butt out of ours. He has got enough problems at home himself, it\u0027s time he sorted his own country out and stopped messing around with ours.\u0027But it does open the door to remind people why so many voted to leave. They\u0027re sick and tired of the dictatorial, bossy, lecturing nature of the European Union.\u0027In his press conference last night, Mr Macron said: \u0027Brexit is the choice of the British people and it is a choice pushed by certain people who predicted easy solutions,\u0027 he said in Salzburg,\u0027 he said.\u0027Brexit has shown us one thing – and I fully respect British sovereignty in saying this – it has demonstrated that those who said you can easily do without Europe, that it will all go very well, that it is easy and there will be lots of money, are liars.  Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab (pictured left) said today that the bloc was mistaken if it thought it could bounce Mrs May into concessions.

After-dinner speech fell flatEU leaders have been refusing to discuss Brexit directly with Mrs May all along - insisting that Mr Barnier is carrying out the negotiations for them.There had been hopes that this summit would be the first occasion when there would be exchanges on the issue at national leader level.However, those hopes were dashed when EU council president Donald Tusk declared that Mrs May would only get to deliver a 10-minute speech at the end of dinner.By that time the leaders had already been through a scratchy four-hour debate on the migration crisis - a bigger concern than Brexit for many of them.And Mrs May caused frustration among her weary audience by effectively reading out the Die Welt article.\u0027That is not the way to command a tired group of leaders who are all bit sick of each other,\u0027 one diplomat told The Times.          Over dinner on Wednesday night (pictured), gathered EU leaders were told that Britain would be prepared to walk away from the negotiating table if a deal was not struck quickly3. Suspicions about plans to slash red tapeThe situation was not helped by the emergence of a report that Trade Secretary Liam Fox was planning to slash food standards after Brexit to give the UK a competitive advantage and secure a US trade deal.Although furiously denied by Dr Fox, the claim seems to have gained traction with delegations from EU countries and encouraged them to take a tough line.One of the EU\u0027s overriding fears is that the UK cutting red tape and lowing taxes could provide an advantage for businesses after we leave.          The situation was not helped by the emergence of a report that Trade Secretary Liam Fox was planning to slash food standards after Brexit to give the UK a competitive advantage and secure a US trade deal4. The wrong kind of supportBritain\u0027s allies, such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Poland, had been pushing for serious consideration of the Chequers blueprint.France and Germany, meanwhile, had been urging a less accommodating approach that preserved the strict rules of the single market.But the advocates for a deeper relationship seem to have been muted somewhat by the strident intervention of Hungarian premier Viktor Orban.He condemned the determination of some EU leaders to \u0027punish\u0027 the UK for choosing to leave. However, Mr Orban is currently viewed as a pariah by other leaders after pushing the country to the political right.          Advocates for a deeper relationship with the UK seem to have been muted somewhat by the strident intervention of Hungarian premier Viktor Orban (pictured)5. Delays to Irish border proposalsThe EU had been expecting Britain to come forward with its own plans for the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 - the big sticking point in sealing the orce package.But having flatly rejected the EU\u0027s thinking, Mrs May is then said to have delivered a difficult message in a meeting with Irish PM Leo Varadkar yesterday morning.She apparently admitted that the UK\u0027s rival \u0027backstop\u0027 blueprint would not be ready for the next EU summit in October.The news caused anger as there had been lingering hopes that summit would see the Withdrawal Agreement to all intents and purposes settled.That is said to have tipped the scales against Mrs May, raising questions about whether the UK was serious about negotiations.After discussing the situation in private for two hours, the hard-line French and German approach won out and the brutal attack on Chequers was launched.

What can we learn from celebrated authors about the art of writing well?Every writer, of school age and older, is in the sentences game. The sentence is our writing commons, the shared ground where all writers walk. A poet writes in sentences, and so does the unsung author who came up with “Items trapped in doors cause delays”. The sentence is the Ur-unit, the core material, the granular element that must be got right or nothing will be right. For James Baldwin, the only goal was “to write a sentence as clean as a bone”.What can celebrated writers teach the rest of us about the art of writing a great sentence? A common piece of writing advice is to make your sentences plain, unadorned and invisible. George Orwell gave this piece of advice its epigram: “Good prose is like a windowpane.” A reader should notice the words no more than someone looking through glass notices the glass.Except that you do notice the glass. Picture an English window in 1946, when Orwell wrote that sentence. It would be smeared with grime from smoke and coal dust and, since houses were damp and windows single-glazed, wont to mist and ice over. The glass might still be cracked from air-raid gunfire or bombs, or covered with shatterproof coating to protect people from flying shards. An odd metaphor to use, then, for clear writing.Behind Orwell’s windowpane theory of prose lies a puritan pride, a sense that the writer will be purified by a clean, sinewy style as by an early morning run and a cold shower. “The great enemy of clear language is insincerity,” he wrote. Insincere writing spat out tired idioms “like a cuttlefish spurting out ink”. Bad ideas were the bedfellows of bad prose. Fake thoughts made fake sentences.Some of this is true but none of it is a good way of learning how to write a sentence. More ethical demand than useful advice, it forces writers back to their own reserves of wisdom and authenticity. It blames bad writing on laziness and dishonesty, when a likelier culprit is lack of skill. If you ordered me to make a blancmange, all I could come up with would be a gloopy, inedible mess – not because I am lazy or dishonest, but because, although I have some vague idea that it needs sugar, cornflour and boiled milk, I don’t know how to make a blancmange.Orwell saw the plain English sentence as the sword of existential truth, a cure-all for the bad faith of modern life. But much of the time he didn’t even follow his own advice. “If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out,” he ordered. Perhaps he should have written: “If you can cut a word, do.”Orwell’s prose, as well as ignoring his own rules when it suits, is really a beautiful contrivance. Take the last thing he wrote, in his hospital notebook: “At 50, everyone has the face he deserves.” This unforgettable sentence has an argument behind it that a moment’s thought will reveal as unfair and untrue. Orwell’s oeuvre is full of such sentences that read like eternal verities and turn out to be nonsense. “We may find in the long run that tinned food is a deadlier weapon than the machine gun.” (We didn’t.) “Serious sport … is war minus the shooting.” (War minus the shooting isn’t war.) “Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness.” (Steady on.)A good sentence imposes a logic on the world’s weirdness. It gets its power from the tension between the ease of its phrasing and the shock of its thought slid cleanly into the mind. A sentence, as it proceeds, is a paring away of options. Each added word, because of the English language’s dependence on word order, reduces the writer’s alternatives and narrows the reader’s expectations. But even up to the last word the writer has choices and can throw in a curveball. A sentence can begin in one place and end in another galaxy, without breaking a single syntactic rule. The poet Wayne Koestenbaum calls it “organising lava”, this pleasure to be got from “pushing a sentence in a wrong direction without altering its sweet grammatical composure”.A memorable sentence makes immediate sense but sounds just slightly odd. The model Kate Moss, once asked for her motto, replied: “Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels” – a terrible message to send about dieting and body image, but a well-turned sentence, surely. Skinny, usually an adjective, is here turned into an abstract noun, paired with another abstract noun, nothing. And yet skinny is also quasi-concrete, because where it lies in the sentence suggests that it can actually be felt, just as food has a taste. But feels also retains its non-sensuous sense of intuiting or experiencing something: skinny feels good. As the sentence ends with the snap of a stressed syllable, our perspective has been altered in a way that feels true, even if we don’t share the sentiment. Reality has shifted a little and then clicked back into place.A sentence is much more than its literal meaning. It is a living line of words where logic and lyric meet – a piece of both sense and sound, albeit the sound is only heard in the reader’s head. Rookie sentence-writers are often too busy worrying about the something they are trying to say and don’t worry enough about how that something looks and sounds. They look straight past the words into the meaning that they have strong-armed into them. They fasten on content and forget about form – forgetting that content and form are the same thing, that what a sentence says is the same as how it says it.The word “sentence” comes from the Latin sentire, to feel. A sentence must be felt by the reader, and a feeling is something that grows and fades like anything else that is alive. A line of words should unfold in space and time, not reveal itself all at once, for the simple reason that it cannot be read all at once.John Donne’s sermons are full of sentences that are ever-alert and open to the world: “And into that gate they shall enter, and in that house they shall dwell, where there shall be no Cloud nor Sun, no darkness nor dazzling, but one equal light … ”. His sentences puzzle out their purposes in allusive phrases that hold the attention briefly before the next phrase takes to the floor. They flaunt their learning but revel in the loose-fitting ligatures of speech and thought. Donne’s prose, just like his poetry, is a sort of heartfelt thinking. It brings together judgment and gentleness, reason and passion, acerbity and receptivity. You can actually see him working it all out in front of you on the page, as each sentence moves and gathers force under the prickling itch of the moment – as if he is scrabbling his way towards a beautiful truth just beyond reach.It’s all in the verbs. Virginia Woolf wrote that she wanted to go beyond the “formal railway line of sentence”, to show how people “feel or think or dream … all over the place”. Her serpentine sentences, held loosely together with dashes and commas, catch the butterfly restiveness of the human mind, and the evanescence of human life, as they come up against the more solid surfaces of the world. Like every skilled writer, though, Woolf starkly varies sentence length. Her long, elastic thought refrains collide with shorter, percussive fragments. A year into the second world war, she wrote this defiant sentence in her diary: “Thinking is my fighting.” Even if that doesn’t have what style guides tend to like – a concrete subject and a strong verb – it has a low rumble of energy running through it. Why? Because, apart from the possessive pronoun my, it consists wholly of verbs or verb forms.A decade ago the American writer Gary Lutz gave a lecture to Columbia University students titled “The sentence is a lonely place”. Lutz told them that he was drawn to writing in which “the sentence is a complete, portable solitude, a minute immediacy of consummated language”. He wanted to read books that he could open at any page and find a sentence – “a totality, an omnitude, unto itself” – that gave him something illuminating and cherishable all on its own.Contemporary writers mostly side with Lutz. They leave space and silence between their sentences, so that the reader can see the full stop and hear its click. Sentences have become less shackled to each other. Those written a few hundred years ago typically began with a whereof or a howsobeit, to resume an unfinished thought. And they used lots of conjunctive adverbs, those connecting words like moreover, namely and indeed. Such adverbs are in historical retreat. The use of indeed peaked in print in the 18th century and has been declining ever since. The number of howevers and moreovers has been falling since the 1840s.Readers today can link sentences in their heads without lots of thuses and whereupons to do it for them. Just as cinemagoers have learned to see the implied continuity of time across the quick cuts of a film, without needing a caption that says “meanwhile, back at the ranch”, so have readers learned to make a little cognitive jump between sentences.A lot of contemporary writing treats its sentences as lonely places, and then joins them together through evocative juxtaposition – the convergence of their collective solitude, if you like. This makes the sentences at the start and end of paragraphs crucial, because that is where the biggest thought-leap occurs. You can alter the whole tone of a sentence by moving it from the end of a paragraph to the start of a new one, and vice versa. Annie Dillard likes to start or end her paragraphs by swerving into unexpected terrain: “Why do we concern ourselves over which side of the membrane of soil our feet poke?” Maggie Nelson leaves gravid pauses between her sentences and paragraphs, where implications sit. Her book The Argonauts tells the story of a developing romance and relationship in short paragraphs and single sentences surrounded by white space. One paragraph begins with a sentence that sparingly conveys a new intimacy: “And then, just like that, I was folding your son’s laundry.”If a writer’s sentences have enough life and interest in them – with “every step an arrival”, as Rainer Maria Rilke put it – they will hold the reader and move the writing along. The writing finds a hidden unity that has no need of the mucilage of linking phrases. Each sentence is like a tidal island that looks cut off until, at low tide, a causeway to the mainland appears. A good lesson for any writer: make each sentence worth reading, and something in it will lead the reader into the next one. Good writers write not just in sentences but with sentences.

So what makes us unique?You are an animal, but a very special one. Mostly bald, you’re an ape, descended from apes your features and actions are carved or winnowed by natural selection. But what a special simian you are. Shakespeare crystallised this thought a good 250 years before Charles Darwin positioned us as a creature at the end of the slightest of twigs on a single, bewildering family tree that encompasses 4bn years, a lot of twists and turns, and 1 billion species.“What a piece of work is a man!” marvels Hamlet. “How noble in reason! How infinite in faculty! … In action how like an angel!  In apprehension how like a god! … The paragon of animals!” Hamlet then ponders the paradox at the heart of humankind: what is this quintessence of dust? We are special, but we are also merely matter. We are animals, yet we behave like gods. Darwin riffed on Hamlet in 1871 in his second masterpiece, The Descent of Man, declaring that we have “god-like intellect”, yet we cannot deny that man – and woman – carries the “indelible stamp of his lowly origin”. This is the central question in understanding our place in the scheme of evolution.What makes us special, while we remain rooted in nature? We evolved from earlier creatures, each on a unique trajectory through time. We share DNA with all the organisms that have ever existed the proteins our genes encrypt utilise a code that is indistinguishable from that in an amoeba or a zebu.How did we become the beings that we are today? Scientists call this state “behavioural modernity”, or sometimes “the full package”, meaning all the things that we consider as part of the human condition: speech, language, consciousness, tool use, art, music, material culture, commerce, agriculture, non‑reproductive sex and more. Precisely when these facets of our lives today arose in our species is debated. But we do know that within the last 40,000 years, they were all in place, all over the world. Which facet singles us out, among other animals – which is distinctively human?Navigating this territory can be treacherous, and riven with contradictions. We know we are animals, evolved via the same mechanisms as all life. This is comprehensively displayed in the limitless evidence of shared evolutionary histories – the fact that all living things are encoded by DNA. Or that similar genes have similar functions in distantly related creatures (the gene that defines an eye is virtually the same in all organisms that have any form of vision). Or that our bodies harbour the indelible stamps of common descent in our bones (our hands contain bones almost perfectly like-for-like with the bones in the flat paddle of a dolphin’s fin, and with a horse’s front legs, and a bat’s wings).Prudent scepticism is required when we compare ourselves with other beasts. Evolution accounts for all life but not all traits are adaptations. We use animals in science every day to try to understand complex biochemical pathways in order that we might develop drugs or understand disease. Mice, rats, monkeys, even cats, newts and armadillos, provide invaluable insights into our own biochemistry, but even so, all researchers acknowledge the limitations of those molecular analogies we shared ancestors with those beasts millions of years ago, and our evolutionary trajectories have nudged that biochemistry to suit each species as it is today.Arguments around these issues are generally the preserve of scientists. But there is a set of behaviours that are also inspected forensically and with evolution in mind whose reach extends far beyond the academy. We are a species that devotes enormous resources, effort and time to touching each other’s genitals. Most animals are sexual beings and the primary function of sex is to reproduce. The statistician David Spiegelhalter estimates that up to 900,000,000 acts of human heterosexual intercourse take place per year in Britain alone – roughly 100,000 per hour. Around 770,000 babies are born in Britain each year, and if we include miscarriages and abortions, the number of conceptions rises to about 900,000 per year.Some – not all – of these seemingly familiar sexual practices can be explained readily. Male Cape ground squirrels are promiscuous, and masturbate after copulation, we think, for hygiene reasons, protecting themselves from sexually transmitted diseases by flushing their tubes. Other behaviour is still mysterious to us: giraffes spend most of their time sexually segregated, and the vast majority of sexual relations appear to be male-to-male penetration. As with the myriad examples of sexual behaviour between members of the same sex, it demonstrates that homosexuality – once, and in many places to this day, decried as a crime against nature – is widespread.Because sex and gender politics are so prominent in our lives, some look to evolution for answers to hard questions about the dynamics between men and women, and the social structures that cause us so much ire. Evolutionary psychologists strain to explain our behaviour today by speculating that it relates to an adaptation to Pleistocene life. Frequently these claims are absurd, such as “women wear blusher on their cheeks because it attracts men by reminding them of ripe fruit”.Purveyors of this kind of pseudoscience are plenty, and most prominent of the contemporary bunch is the clinical psychologist and guru Jordan Peterson, who in lectures asserts this “fact” about blusher and fruit with absolute certainty. Briefly, issues with that idea are pretty straightforward: most fruit is not red most skin tones are not white and crucially, the test for evolutionary success is increased reproductive success. Do we have the slightest blip of data that suggests that women who wear blusher have more children than those who don’t? No, we do not.Peterson is also well known for using the existence of patriarchal dominance hierarchies in a non-specific lobster species as supporting evidence for the natural existence of male hierarchies in humans. Why out of all creation choose the lobster? Because it fits with Peterson’s preconceived political narrative. Unfortunately, it’s a crazily poor choice, and woefully researched. Peterson asserts that, as with humans, lobsters have nervous systems that “run on serotonin” – a phrase that carries virtually no scientific meaning – and that as a result “it’s inevitable that there will be continuity in the way that animals and human beings organise their structures”. Lobsters do have serotonin-based reward systems in their nervous systems that in some way correlate with social hierarchies: higher levels of serotonin relate to increased aggression in males, which is part of establishing mate choice when, as Peterson says, “the most desirable females line up and vie for your attention”.Sexual selection is one of the driving forces of natural selection in most animals. In general, males compete with each other, and females subsequently have choice over which males they mate with. While this is one of the most studied areas of evolutionary biology, it’s incredibly hard to establish that rules that apply to lobsters (or does and stags, or peacocks and peahens) also apply to humans. There are physical and behavioural differences between men and women in relation to sex, but our cultural evolution has loosened the shackles of natural selection to the extent that we cannot satisfactorily match our behaviour with other beasts, and claims that we can are often poor science.Peterson believes that the system that is used by lobsters is why social hierarchies exist in humans. The problem with the assertion is this: serotonin is indeed a major part of the neural transmitter network in humans, but the effect of serotonin in relation to aggression is the opposite. Lower levels increase aggression, because it restricts communication between the frontal cortex and amygdala. Lobsters don’t have an amygdala or frontal lobes. Or brains for that matter. Most serotonin in humans is produced to aid digestion. And lobsters also urinate out of their faces. Trying to establish evolutionary precedents that justify or explain away our own behaviour is scientific folly.If you wanted to make a different but equally specious political argument with a waft of science about how to arrange our society, you could compare us to killer whales. They live in a matriarchal social group, in some cases led by post-menopausal females. Or hyenas, the animal with the greatest jaw strength of any, which are also matriarchal, and engage in clitoral licking, to bond socially and to establish hierarchy. Or the insect order hymenoptera, which includes ants, bees and wasps, and are roughly the same evolutionary distance from us as lobsters. Their social hierarchy involves a single queen and males, whose role is twofold: protecting the colony, and providing sperm on demand – they are literally sex slaves. Or the freshwater small invertebrates called bdelloid rotifers: millions of years ago they abandoned males altogether, and seem to be doing just fine.Yes, hierarchies assuredly exist in animals as competition is an inherent part of nature, and our sexual biology has common roots with all life on Earth. But we should not presume that understanding the biology of other animals will necessarily illuminate our own, as Peterson does. It’s a strange irony that someone who claims to bow to evolution should simultaneously fail to grasp its concepts. In some ways it’s a less cogent argument to an evolutionary biologist than that of creationists, who simply deny that evolution has happened. Then again, it was Darwin who said that “ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge”. Nowadays, you can buy “lobster dominance” T-shirts.We crave stories, and for those tales to deliver narrative satisfaction. We want dramatic triggers that bestow us with behaviours that are ours alone and therefore might be used to define humankind, and in doing so give us a sense of belonging or even purpose in the confusing modern world. We look to science and history to fulfil those cravings. But life is complex, culture is dynamic: evolution doesn’t work that way. Sometimes we talk about cultural evolution in opposition to biological evolution, the former being passed on socially, the latter being encoded in our DNA. But the truth is that they are intrinsically linked, and a better way to think about it is as gene-culture co-evolution. Each drives the other, and cultural transmission of ideas and skills requires a biologically encoded ability to do so. Biology enables culture, culture changes biology. What humans uniquely do is that we accumulate culture, and build on it. Many animals learn, but only we teach.As we meandered into the most recent 100,000 years or so, our culture became ever more significant in crafting our abilities. This is apparent in the fact that our bodies have not significantly changed in that time. A woman or man from 1,000 centuries ago would fit in perfectly well in any city in the world today if we tidied them up and gave them a haircut. But the way we live our lives since then has become ever more complex.We are desperate to find the things that tip us over the edge from being merely an animal into Hamlet’s paragon of animals. Was it our language? Was it religion, or music, or art, or any number of things that are not as unique to us as we had once thought? The truth is that it was all of these things and more, but crucially, it was in the engagement of our minds to transmit skills and ideas to others. We changed our societies and maximised how culture is transmitted. We took evolution’s work, and by teaching each other, we created ourselves. The stories we tell about how we came to be who we are often neglect the complexity of biology and the oceans of time during which we evolved. To understand human evolution, we need new stories.• The Book of Humans: The Story of How We Became Us by Adam Rutherford is published by W\u0026ampN (£18.99).

To be eligible for the scheme, investors must have more than $1m (£760,000) of investable assets aside from their main home or an annual income of $200,000-plus, or a joint income of $300,000-plus.Dire Straits’ heyday was the 1980s and the band split in 1995 but, according to Royalty Exchange, their back catalogue’s earnings “are not only still growing but are outperforming the growth of the broader music industry”. Much of that growth is down to the boom in music streaming, which has introduced heritage rock acts to new generations and prompted many older music fans to revisit the bands of their youth.The investment offer has come about because Dire Straits’ longtime former manager Ed Bicknell is selling off his share of the sound recording royalties generated by the band’s entire back catalogue, together with solo releases from the band members Mark Knopfler and John Illsley. That includes all six studio albums, including Brothers in Arms, the eighth best-selling album of all time in the UK, plus hits such as Sultans of Swing and Walk of Life, along with music videos, live albums and any existing or future best-of compilations.Knopfler, the band’s lead singer and guitarist, is not involved in the investment scheme, although “he is aware of it”, the company said.Some may wonder about the potential returns that might be generated by Dire Straits royalties, bearing in mind that for some people they are a band inextricably linked to the 80s and the yuppie generation, and that, unlike many of their peers, they are no longer in existence. The ChartMasters website noted earlier this year that while Brothers in Arms was the highest-selling rock album during the 1980s, “it is losing ground, since Bon Jovi’s Slippery When Wet, U2’s The Joshua Tree, Bruce Springsteen’s Born In the USA and Guns N’Roses’ Appetite for Destruction are now all ahead of it, with total sales ranging from 46m to 50m”.Meanwhile, Money for Nothing – a US number one in 1985 – has in recent years run into censorship issues over its controversial lyrics, which could potentially limit airplay. Lines in the song include “See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup … That little faggot got his own jet airplane”, “Money for nothin’ and chicks for free” and “Bangin’ on the bongos like a chimpanzee”. In a 1985 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Knopfler was quoted as saying: “The singer in Money for Nothing is a real ignoramus, hard hat mentality – somebody who sees everything in financial terms. I mean, this guy has a grudging respect for rock stars. He sees it in terms of, well, that’s not working and yet the guy’s rich: that’s a good scam.”Investors from outside the US are able to participate in the new scheme, which is technically a “private syndicate”. Investors participate by buying units in a specially created limited liability company (LLC) that holds the royalties. Unit holders are then entitled to their proportional share of income generated by the LLC.• A community share scheme raised £600,000 from 3,000 investors to help restore Hastings Pier after a disastrous fire in 2010.

Here is an edited selection.Growing up in southern California in the 1970s, I learned to walk the city from an early age. It taught me many things, about the intimacy of shared experience, the points of the compass, discovering the weirdness in daily life – like the day I spotted a massive tortoise waddling majestically down the street, someone’s escaped pet. And it taught me the concept of Stranger Danger. “No, thank you,” my six-year-old self told the nice lady who wanted to give me a lift home. I can still tell you the license plate number of the dirty brown station wagon that curb-crawled me in third grade.I now live in Germany, where many cities are eminently walkableYet for the last 40 years, the number of parents driving their children has steadily increased, which is a sad trend. For all the benefits driving seems to offer, parents should realise what they are depriving their children of when they don’t let them walk the city. Ursula Schoenberg, Frankfurt, GermanyThe arches of the ruined San Francisco monastery, in the old quarter of Santo Domingo, loom in the sky like Jurassic limbs as you follow the street towards the Caribbean Sea. Colourful clothes hang from iron balustrades to dry, people sweep their porches and talk to their neighbours from an assembling of turquoise, vermilion and grapefruit-yellow wooden dwellings. Rapt by this bucolic scenery, I was almost hit by a car driven in the typical Dominican manner: without any regard for pedestrians.People love to see you walking in Santo Domingo – they say “saludos” (greetings) and smile – but will shout at you if you take too long to cross the street. Carlos Guillen, Santo Domingo, Dominican RepublicMy city of Szczecin is not pedestrian-friendly. However, I enjoy my 20-minute workday walk to the bus station. Some people will make a face and ask how it is possible that such a dull walk could be my favourite. But I notice things that I couldn’t from the interior of a car. The pedestrian’s world is not perfect: you will have to brave the uneven pavements catcalling, if you are a woman beggars. It is not always comfortable to hear and experience that day-to-day drama, but we should not hide from it, like many politicians do. Maciej G, Szczecin, PolandI have lived in Southeast Asia for much of the past seven years and Bangkok has become one of my favourite places to walk. It gets a bad reputation in the English-language travel and literary world. It’s exoticised through descriptions of gleaming Buddhist temples, always-smiling locals and delicious food. More often, there are complaints of harassment by men selling sex, drugs and tuk-tuk rides in steamy, crowded streets with impossible traffic. Sure, that happens on a few streets in Bangkok. But saying you can’t walk around without being propositioned is like saying you can’t go to New York City without being hounded by costumed characters based on a walk through Times Square. There is so much more to dynamic, creative Bangkok than the industries catering to the demands of mostly Western men. Aileen Thomson, Bangkok, ThailandUp and down and definitely up again. You quickly understand the meaning of seven colinas (hills), the phrase printed on transport cards in Lisbon. There is no escaping them. On the upside, the views you get as part of your trip to the supermarket, or with your pastel de nata. The other is the delicious reminder of “I’m fit!” when visitors complain of their aching calves. The downsides are literal. The light-reflecting cobbles, slippery when wet or dry, are responsible for one of the highest rates of podiatry problems in Europe. On the steeper inclines it can be preferable to walk in the road. The epidemic of parking wherever the hell you like can also push you into the flow of oncoming traffic. Joanne Stilges, Lisbon, PortugalWalking has always been my primary mode of transportation. I have a healthy fear of driving and prefer my own legs to a bicycle. Growing up in Onehunga, Auckland, I explored factories, graveyards and the more scenic parks. I did not get my driver’s licence until I moved to the sprawling city of Canberra to study. There I looked forward to moving to Berlin for my postdoc, where I wouldn’t have insults – or bottles – thrown at me from cars. Berlin was indeed a dream for walking, though I soon learnt that heels do not work on cobblestones. Walk, S-bahn, walk, U-bahn, walk, there. Walk to the Saturday markets, walk to meet friends, walk home at 5am, a trifle unsteady.My husband is a walker, too. When we had our daughter, I walked everywhere with her, in the carrier or later the buggy. When we moved back to New Zealand, we rented a house halfway up a killer hill in Island Bay in Wellington. Playcentre mothers would comment of our three-year-old: “She walks all that way?” Yes, she could on a good day, because that was how we got around. Now we live in flatter Upper Hutt and I walk everywhere, though kindly neighbours always ask if I’d like a lift. I walk to enjoy the day, to marvel at the trees and hills, for exercise. I walk because it is as natural as breathing and it makes me feel good. Mary Hayek-Williams, Wellington, New ZealandI decided not to drive when I was 16. The first Earth Day had just happened and they said driving was causing this new thing called “pollution” and if we didn’t stop the petroleum culture we would all be choking to death in 50 years. I am now 65, and I walk everywhere all the time. I love walking the half-mile from my house to the public transit station because I can greet my neighbours and see what people are doing to their houses or growing in their gardens, and say hello to the dogs and cats and kids along the way. Not driving has caused me quite a bit of inconvenience, but it has kept me from getting fat. It stopped me doing too much each day and thus slowed the pace of life. It made me resourceful about getting places in other ways. It allowed me to make friends while travelling on public transit. In a car I can’t see anything or talk to anyone and the driver is usually mad and yelling at the pedestrians and other cars. How is that a better life? Mary Kay Ryan, Oak Park, IllinoisMy favourite place to walk in Quezon City is inside the University of the Philippines. The reason is simple: it’s the only place where there are sidewalks. There are small blocks, shade provided by trees, human-scale buildings and other pedestrians. I get to feel the city, to experience its problems and qualities in a deeper way. The city was made for cars, and the few sidewalks that do exist are taken by street vendors and a jeepney ride is so cheap that people go for it, regardless of the length of the trip. The biggest challenge to walking here is the culture. As I heard once: “let’s bring back the dignity of walking”. Anna Clara Marçall, Quezon City, The PhilippinesI am very fortunate that I can walk and do not require a wheelchair however, my disabilities cause me severe pain if I walk long distances. There are millions like me who fall into the zone between able-bodied and wheelchair confined. When I hear the term “pedestrian friendly”, my first thought is “disability unfriendly”. There is a new outdoor mall near me with a pedestrian-friendly town centre design. It is a sprawling, lively place, but I can’t shop there. Walking needs to be encouraged in a way that does not forget about the needs of the disabled. Pamela L Clements, Jacksonville, IllinoisI moved to Portland 23 years ago to attend the art college. Now, living in North Portland, I come downtown about once a month to buy supplies, meet my wife at work, visit friends and check in at my gallery. For those of us spread across the city’s five quadrants, downtown remains an easy meeting point. We also go downtown for protests and parades. Protests and parades put our bodies in control of asphalt usually held hostage by cars, and – whether permitted or not – it feels like the city belongs to us again. Almost all marches cross Burnside Ave, sometimes taking over its Bridge, sometimes cutting back and forth between NW and SW downtown. Each street corner triggers recall, some of past protests I’ve experienced, others – like the 1991 protests against Bush Sr. – that have been related to me by folks who were there. This picture (above) is from pencil notes of the 2017 inauguration rally, which was hit hard by the Portland police. I’m a marcher, not a face-the-grenade-activist I left early for the train, watching police trucks begin their flanking motion through the side streets. Gabriel Liston, Portland, OregonWalks don’t come any nicer in Sydney than at Mrs Macquarie’s Chair, on a peninsula in the harbour to Darling Harbour. Passing through the botanical gardens, the old Rocks precinct and arriving at the pedestrianised Piermont bridge, the route has history, culture and meaning. Most notable, however, is the absence of cars along most of the way. The lack of noise pollution makes one aware of all the sounds that would be more easily heard if it not for the constant burning rubber and churning of engines on Sydney’s roadways. Dominic, Sydney, AustraliaI’ve been living in Edinburgh for over 15 years. The Scottish winter can dishearten the most dedicated of walkers, but on a summer evening I’ll finish work early, jump on the tram then the bus, get home, change and set off straight away for an hour of wandering and evening dreaming. What better and cheaper way than walking to sort my thoughts and keep fit? The families, joggers and dog walkers in Braidburn Valley Park help me shake off the stress and insincerity of my corporate job. I’ll then head towards Hermitage Drive – where I might resent the obvious wealth if I weren’t so chilled out. By the time I make my way to the Blackford Hill and pond, it’s all about nature, fresh air and the massive bag of blackberries I’ll take as my bounty. Marisa Conde, Edinburgh, ScotlandIn 30 years, I have walked a total 64,200km, which is one-and-a-half times the circumference of Earth. Sixteen months ago I set a target to walk a cumulative distance equal to the length of India, from the north tip to the south. I walk through the city of Pune daily on my way to my office, and follow this practice in cities that I visit all over the world. There was a time when it used to feel very conventional to walk to school, college or work. However, back then most walkers were driven by poverty or the pathetic public transportation system. In one job I used to walk 9km (5.6 miles) to work. I was given a memo stating that my walking did not present the organisation in a good light. I had a hard time explaining my passion. But today it is linked to fitness, with many companies providing incentives for walking to work. Jitendra Date, Pune, IndiaEvery morning I wake, groan, pull on my shorts, brush my teeth, and put on my walking shoes. I walk my neighbourhood, Melville, along wide roads lined with beautiful trees and exquisite flowers. The skies are always pretty, too. I greet the paper recyclers pushing their extraordinarily heavy loads, the broom vendors hoping for their first sale of the day, the car guards. Sometimes I tell the guy who sells drugs on my corner to take a hike. And I always cross the road to say hello to the dogs. On 7th Street, the restaurants are usually just setting up. I walk past the window cleaners and the street sweepers, the waiters and the masseurs, the old man who asks if I can “spare some change?” My barista sees me coming and says, “Good morning, Sandra. Flat white?” I drink a lot of coffee, and I always walk to pick it up.Walking clears my head, gets me into a routine, gives me a sense of community. I love it. I love my ’hood. And I love that, at 56, my legs are still good. Sandra Caganoff, Johannesburg, South AfricaThe trick to walking in Tokyo is never to make eye contact. Two million people use Shinjuku station every day, and the pavements, walkways, subways, malls and passages that feed it are teeming. You don’t look directly into the faces of folk coming your way, and that lack of eye contact signals that you aren’t going to swerve. But they’re not looking at you either, so each party is minutely altering their trajectory with every step. This delicate balance is easily upset. First-timers, gaijin (outsiders), or the rare ruralist who make the mistake of looking indicate to oncoming traffic that they will swerve. Mutual eye contact can be disastrous as you both alter course in the same direction, at the same time. You might offer a whispered, heartfelt “Ah! Sumimasen!” (sorry), but it is too little, too late – you’ve lost face, and they’ve moved on. Rachel Evans, Tokyo, JapanI’m gradually losing my vision, and there came a day eight years ago when it felt irresponsible to drive. I took my car key off its ring and dropped it in a kitchen drawer. I’ve been a pedestrian ever since. In my suburb of Richmond, walking is exercise – an optional activity. My neighborhood even has a walking club, a group who walk up and down our cul-de-sac streets. But when they have an errand to accomplish, they use a car. Well, of course they do. Sidewalks are laid here and there and may not connect, making my routes something of an expedition. Sometimes snow removed from the roads is deposited on them in mounds. I know where the uneven sidewalks are, the roads with the well-worn footpath where a sidewalk should be, which streets have no crosswalks. I’ve learned to love the walks anyway. The pace is predictably, inescapably human.Last winter I found a new route – out my back gate, through the woods and down the greenbelt buffering homes from the shops. In the snow these walks are bliss, silent except for the squeak of the powder under my boots. The snow is brilliant at midday and in the dusk it turns almost blue, as though lit from within. Sometimes in the course of chatting with a neighbour, the fact I don’t drive comes up. The most predictable responses are the wistful sighs. “That sounds so nice,” they say. Yeah, it is. Elizabeth Clark, Richmond, VirginiaRiyadh is not a pedestrian-friendly city – when I began walking here drivers would often stop to ask me if I was lost and needed a lift. While there are elegant boulevards which would not look out of place in Spain or France, what draws me is the dusty scrubland at the city’s fringes. To get there you walk past the fast food joints, coffee franchises and supermarkets, the gyms filled with lycra-clad men on treadmills staring at their phones, and rush from lane to lane across the motorway, dodging speeding SUVs (their drivers also staring at their phones). After all that, it is reassuring to come across the robed tribesmen arguing over the price of the sheep milling all around as they have done for millennia. Ray Mac Uait, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaAs a resident of New York and now London, I’m no stranger to walking city streets. But the miles logged were taken to another level when I had my son and began my year-long maternity leave. What could have ben an incredibly isolating period was filled with rich exploration as I put my son in a pram and went walking to keep from going mad from too much time at home. It was good for us both – exposing him to the sights, sounds and smells of a rich street culture, and making me feel part of the human world. Inevitably he would fall asleep and I’d keep walking, listening to podcasts and strolling through the quiet back streets of Soho or Shoreditch like they were old friends.Exploring a city with a baby makes you aware of things you never had to consider before: how wide are the sidewalks? (No to Soho.) Are there baby-changing toilets along the way? (Bermondsey is impossible.) Are the coffeeshops big enough to fit a buggy? (Don’t even try the City.) One of our go-to routes is the 45-minute walk from our flat next to Burgess Park to reach Borough Market just before it opens – a truly magical moment that very few Londoners experience. This is when I feel most at home.

The most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that it is not a negotiation, and never has been. Blessed with superior size, wealth and power, the EU has been able to dictate the framework and substance of the talks, and has refused any deviation from its red lines.The second most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that the EU will prioritise its economic and political cohesion above all else. That cohesion rests on two key outcomes: an unided single market and an open border on the island of Ireland.It is these principles that have led us to Salzburg. The EU will not accept the Chequers plan, which proposes a single market in goods but not in services, capital or people. It will also not accept any possibility of border infrastructure in Ireland, which is anathema to Dublin and, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, presents a credible risk of sectarian violence. That has duly paved the way for the Brexit endgame, which EU negotiator Michel Barnier has now confirmed: there will be a border for goods in the Irish Sea.The EU does not, however, want to antagonise or humiliate the UK, and has scrambled to defuse the drama of this development. Barnier stresses that most checks between Britain and Northern Ireland will take place in offices and warehouses, and only live animals and food products will need to be examined at ports themselves. But no amount of diplomatic politesse can conceal Brexit’s reality: one part of the UK will be economically split from another.Theresa May effectively guaranteed this impasse last December, when she agreed the Irish backstop. The backstop guarantees, as a last resort, Northern Ireland’s alignment with Ireland on the customs union and single market to ensure the free flow of goods. Northern Ireland would be permitted to retain the single market just in goods because the Good Friday agreement depends on it. But no such exemptions would ever be open to the rest of the UK. Although the EU was too coy to admit it at the time, this always meant that the whole UK would have to commit to the prospect of staying in the full single market and customs union, or else concede the erection of trade barriers within its territory.If May had been armed with political judgment, or merely cognisant of reality, she would have prepared the British people – and government – for that concession. She has instead wasted nine months denying she ever made it. It comes as little surprise that the EU has now taken the initiative where the UK refused.The prime minister has boxed herself in with promises she cannot keep. She insists on the ability to strike UK-only trade deals and end free movement of people, while refusing to accept its consequences. In Salzburg she announced “the idea that I should assent to the legal separation of the United Kingdom into two customs territories is not credible”, but failed to acknowledge the lack of credibility in any other option. She resembles a desperate fugitive who urgently needs to escape a building but instead keeps inexplicably locking herself inside it.The most problematic consequence of the EU’s proposals is one that Brussels is most loath to spell out. This is not simply about checking goods. If Northern Ireland permanently operates a different customs regime from the rest of the UK and implements EU tariffs, then Northern Ireland must be exempt from any future UK trade deals. But it is almost inconceivable that the DUP – let alone the UK parliament – would ever agree to such a scenario. The DUP leader in the Commons, Nigel Dodds, has referred even to the checking of goods as “separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain”.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest. They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods. He also makes plain his contention that the Chequers plan contains no workable idea for the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.But at the same time the EU has been careful to not entirely dismiss the proposals, raising the possibility it could accept some adapted version.Officially, May and her cabinet, though even here the backing can seem lukewarm at times. Asked about Chequers, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the government’s plan “right now”, indicating alternative ideas could be considered.Even May’s allies concede it will be a hugely difficult task to get the plan through parliament. Damian Green, the PM’s close friend and former de fact deputy, described the process as “walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks at us from both sides”.On the remain side of the Conservatives, the former education secretary Justine Greening called the Chequers plan “more unpopular than the poll tax”, saying May should start again from scratch.If anything can save the plan – and it’s an outside shot – it will be a combination of the hugely tight timetable and the fact that, as yet, no one else has yet produced a plan with a better chance of being accepted by parliament.On 20 September, an informal gathering in Salzburg, Austria, will provide a snapshot of current EU thinking. Then, 10 days later, the Conservative conference could show the Chequers plan is holed below the waterline.If it survives these tests, the proposals will then reach the crucial EU summit Brussels on 18 October, with something final needed, at the very latest, in the next two months. PETER WALKERMay consequently has two tasks. First, she must determine whether her government would survive opposition to an effective border in the Irish Sea from the DUP and Commons. But more important, she must decide whether she values the economic integrity of the UK more than the ability to unilaterally change Britain’s tariffs and end migration rights for Polish plumbers.The EU, for its part, knows it holds all the cards and recognises the danger of giving ground. Its priority is to accommodate Dublin, not London. It also concludes that a government so determined to leave must believe it can look after itself. Brussels has no reason or incentive to make any better offer.The government has never understood the Brexit process and therefore has always botched it. It expects the EU to treat the UK both as an equally powerful third country, and as a member state still deserving the EU’s protection. It is neither. And so in a battle of red lines, the UK will lose. That is the most brutal lesson of all.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e74e3130293264e9dc49f54d5e27301ac41f06/0_0_4537_2724/master/4537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188628b0b48c85af41c291785c19a278","title":"european language brexit britain","story":"For someone who occasionally seems unsure whether their wife is Japanese or Chinese, Jeremy Hunt seems to speak pretty good Japanese.Unless bits of it were Chinese, obviously.

How many of us slogged through years of irregular verbs and asking the way to the station, only to be reduced in middle age to fumbled holiday conversations in shops and frantic pointing?But watching Hunt reminded me of something I’ve been wondering for a while, which is whether the prospect of leaving Europe will finally make learning a language feel less like a slog and more like a thrillingly subversive act one great defiant two fingers to everything Brexit Britain stands for.Languages are lovely things to learn in their own right, of course, if you’re so minded living, breathing entities that weave in and out of each other, exchanging sounds and words and ideas. But they’re also one of the purest forms of soft power. Speaking to someone in their own tongue is a disarming act, a gesture of empathy and respect. If you’re not actually very good at it then in some ways all the better at least it’s obvious you’re making an effort, which is why typing furiously into Google Translate doesn’t quite have the same effect.Eventually, once they’re good enough to stop occasionally churning out scrambled garbage, robot translators will presumably put human translators out of business. But they’ll still struggle to convey what a human switching between languages does, which is a fundamental willingness to put oneself out in order to put someone else at ease. Speaking foreign languages is about meeting people halfway, building bridges and accepting differences – all skills sorely in need of some practice, judging by the current tone of public\u0026nbspconversation.But above all, languages open so many doors to understanding. There are few better ways of grasping why so many British negotiating gambits flop in Brussels than reading a German newspaper’s take on them. (I still have fond memories of sneaking into French government briefings at EU summits, the gist of which was usually that the French had conclusively won all the arguments, to compare them with the Downing Street version in which oddly enough it was generally the British who had triumphed.)And even to understand the construction of a language can shed light on a different way of thinking. What seems like basic politeness in English sounds almost weirdly apologetic if translated directly into anything from Spanish to Hebrew, while people translating directly the other way can sound rude, abrupt or stilted to English ears even when that’s not remotely the intention. A basic knowledge of how someone’s first language works goes a long way to avoiding small, grating cultural misunderstandings when they’re using their second.It’s true that English remains the lingua franca of big tourist resorts and business conferences. But the trouble with grandly relying on everyone else to speak your language is that it can make you oddly vulnerable. What stubborn monoglots often don’t realise is that they will only ever hear as much as the people around them want them to hear that private conversations and whispered asides will remain a closed book. If you really want to take back control, then learn a language, and with it the small covert thrill of eavesdropping on conversations that people don’t realise you can understand.But it’s Brexit that could turn an abstract intellectual pleasure into a small private act of defiance, both for grieving remainers and for those liberal leavers who actually meant what they said about leaving the EU but not leaving Europe. For those who can’t bear to see Britain defined by belligerent isolationism, who don’t want the rest of the world to think that this is who we are, then one tiny but practical way of showing it is brushing up on a European language and making a determined effort to use it. Cold comfort, obviously, for those who would rather Britain never left at all. But if the great rupture is coming, then we still have a choice over how culturally isolated we become. The least we can do is keep talking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47c02b0017a38350848a2c3769519e0f63b8b6d0/0_150_4672_2804/master/4672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d8db8f17dc8902b068274a2f1da64d9","title":"labour timid education lib dems look radical","story":"As a party member I want to see Angela Rayner bringing forward election-winning ideas, not more of the sameI’ve been a teacher for the past five years at an inner London academy, and I’ve seen the injustices that education professionals, students and their parents face first-hand. State schools are chronically underfunded, while elite private school fees cost up to £30,000 a year. Ofsted and school league tables are used to enforce a narrow vision of education, and an Institute of Education report this week has found that teachers in England have the lowest job satisfaction of all English-speaking countries.Perhaps most importantly, students are suffering: the OECD has reported that young people in the UK are among the unhappiest in the world. This is the result of 40 years of education “reforms” driven by a rightwing political agenda, favouring privatisation, obsessive testing and endless competition between students and between schools – as if these were things to be celebrated in themselves.As an active Labour member I want to see radical ideas coming from shadow secretary of state Angela Rayner aimed at tackling these challenges. Labour’s flagship education policy, the National Education Service (NES), contains the seeds of this radical potential. But the idea remains an empty shell: there hasn’t been a single education policy announcement from Rayner since the NES idea was launched 18 months ago. Layla Moran, education spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats and a former teacher, on the other hand, made a powerful speech to the Liberal Democrat conference this week.She promised to abolish Ofsted, league tables and SATs, to remove private school charity tax status, and subtly hinted at abolishing the 11-plus test for grammar schools, because they perpetuate “state-sponsored segregation”. I have never voted for the Liberal Democracts and never will. But there’s no denying that they currently have the most radical offer on the table when it comes to education.By contrast, Rayner in her  interview this week insisted that her party’s policymaking on education would not be “ideologically driven”.The trouble is, education policy has always been ideologically driven. So either Labour is going to challenge the particular neoliberal ideology that has created the current mess or it isn’t. And if it doesn’t, it won’t fix it.Rayner claims that academies as such are not a problem. But academisation has led to a situation in which we now have a competitive market in education that pits desperate schools against each other to retain their “market position”. This has led to terrible examples of gaming the system and outright corruption, at the expense of the most vulnerable children. The recent education select committee report showed that disproportionately high numbers of special educational needs students are being “off-rolled” to improve league tables positions. The academy revolution promised that the market would improve schools for all our children, and yet the gap in attainment between working class children and the rest stubbornly persists.Rayner is right, of course, when she says that many vulnerable, working-class young people are being failed. And everyone agrees that practical education should be more highly valued than it is by our elitist system. But simply saying that we need more “technical” or “vocational” training, as Rayner does in her interview, is not enough. Her suggestion that the study of history is too “abstract” suggests a dangerous anti-intellectualism. It also reproduces the snobbish belief that working-class children shouldn’t have access to high-status knowledge. The 2011 Wolf report made clear that vocational qualifications under New Labour were an abject failure. Not only did they not prepare young people for skilled work, but they also created a narrow, technical curriculum that meant students continued to be locked out of the powerful knowledge that teachers know can enable them to understand the social, economic – and dare I say it, historical – forces that shape their worlds.When asked about private schools Rayner rules out abolishing them, saying that if we only make “the state sector good enough” then private schools will wither on the vine. She forgets the main reason many people choose private education is snobbery – they don’t want their children being educated with the “great unwashed”. Labour’s plans to impose VAT on private school fees was a step in the right direction.So while the NES remains a potentially radical idea, that potential is currently going to waste.The Lib Dem policies don’t go far enough for me. They would only roll back the worst of the education reforms adopted under Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. But Labour should be offering a great deal more than that. Labour must have an exciting vision for the future, a vision for the NES inspired perhaps by Finland, where schools promote collaborative, creative and emancipatory learning, rather than endless competition for exam results.Labour galvanised people with its manifesto in 2017 because it promised something genuinely different, yet this has not been reflected in Labour’s education policy to date. As a teacher, I know that my students and their parents deserve more from Labour: otherwise, the deep inequality that blights our education system is set to continue.• Holly Rigby is a teacher and a member of the Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e55fc83059436d4d94133a6e4866c09d0b0006c3/0_178_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67ff4a31692d38663bfdacda08e683ce","title":"northern commuters government rail service passengers","story":"The service provided by Northern (rail) has fallen well below a decent standard for many years now, but has significantly worsened since Arriva took over the franchise in 2016. I founded the Northern Resist group to protest about how difficult people’s lives were becoming to manage as a result of a train service that is so integral to the country’s functioning – and that is failing them every single day.While the delays, cancellations and overcrowding were my biggest gripes, other issues such as communication, my treatment on social media and general lack of empathy towards my situation exacerbated my angst with Northern. Following the timetable change in May 2018 the situation became a whole lot worse. The chaos that ensued on Northern and other parts of the UK rail network was laid bare by the rail regulator’s report on Thursday – “nobody took charge”, it concluded.My commute can be difficult. In fact, I’m pleasantly surprised when it’s not. But in comparison with many of those I have contact with, I feel almost lucky and find myself thinking “well at least mine wasn’t as bad as theirs”. Commuting has become a race to the bottom where it almost becomes acceptable to know you simply got home – or you were only 30 minutes late instead of an hour – because somebody else had it worse.My typical commute involves checking Northern’s app before setting off. It normally says the train is on time, but by the time I’ve got to the station it’s been cancelled. On my way home, with no warning, an announcement will say the train is splitting into two and change its destination – leaving hundreds of stranded passengers. Or the train will commence its journey but without warning it won’t make all its scheduled stops, again leaving passengers not knowing how they’ll get home. During rush hour at both ends of the day it feels like chaos nobody seems to have a grip of the situation.Through the pressure group, I’ve encountered people who have been disciplined at work for arriving late because of the train chaos others have lost hours of personal time with family and children. Some people have been forced to change jobs for a lesser salary and more have experienced poor mental health or been forced to move home, all because of the failures of our rail service. One person I know now gets up at 3.30am with a small child just so she can get to work for an earlier start which then lets her finish earlier in the day, reducing the risk of being late for childminders and incurring extra costs. When I consider how extreme that sounds I quickly remember that this is the reality for many. Other commuters have been forced to stay overnight in hotels after the last train was cancelled without any warning.One very significant thing I’ve noticed is how stressed many people are: this is stress which can be directly linked to poor travel experiences with Northern. This has an impact on the economy, employers, relationships, social links, mental health and wellbeing. So what can be done to improve the situation?This issue has been debated more times than I care to remember, and it ultimately comes down to nationalising the rail services. We must take Northern back into public ownership. This is reflected in opinions across the spectrum and has cross-party political support. Any suggestion that commuter pressure groups are just a bunch of unruly lefty rebels running up and down trains hoping to start a rebellion is wholly inaccurate.It is totally unacceptable. The government has a duty to us – and to our employers and our family members – to intervene and save our rail service.• Kate Anstee is a single mum, welfare rights officer, train commuter and founder of the Northern Resist campaign for better rail services"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85593b225f863bebc4e4b1a5adbfba2b7aacdb4e/0_75_5562_3336/master/5562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eece874cb06e12aa06d86313b19a5279","title":"oxford english dictionary young people slang","story":"Anyone’s who’s played a heated game of Scrabble will know that the dictionary is much more than a simple resource that records and define common words. It is also a place where history and culture is preserved. When a word enters the dictionary, it is “real” established, bona fide, and must be accepted. It plays an active role in defining not just words but our world.So I was delighted to find that this week the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) asked the public to help give the dictionary treatment to some common youth slang words. They have asked children and teenagers to send in examples of current slang, and have apparently already been tracking the shifting meaning of words such as “bare” (intensifier, meaning very or a lot). “Peng” (meaning good-looking or of exceptional quality) and “lit” (meaning fun, exciting) can’t be far behind.On the one hand, is it really cause for celebration? Why celebrate the OED simply doing its job? These are words uttered regularly by huge swaths of the population, albeit almost exclusively younger people. (In the case of bare, which was in circulation when I was a teenager, I’m fairly certain some of the people saying it now are pushing 40). It’s therefore only right they are included, to help others understand the words, and to record their arrival.But on the other hand, there is a touching symbolism to this story. That such an institution is reaching out to the public to help is a reminder that language is made by us all, and not dictated from ivory towers. It is a bottom-up phenomenon. In a society wrought by intergenerational inequality, it is a wonderful message to the young, to tell them that their daily lives matter and are worthy of recording.Such symbolism is certainly not lost on me. How we speak is the result of thousands of influences, histories and cultures, and some being deemed acceptable and others not speaks to entrenched social hierarchies. How I speak, as a non-white woman from a working-class background, has been regularly policed throughout my life. To take just one example: the university tutor who marked me down on a poetry assignment because I “miscounted the syllables required”. The word hour is two syllables in my accent, but one syllable in the Queen’s English.Still, that’s probably nothing compared with the experience of people who were born overseas. My mother for example, who can speak English fluently but has a slight accent and looks Asian, was heavily scrutinised growing up. (There is truly nothing more maddening than someone passive aggressively saying “Sorry, can you speak English?” at a customer service counter because you dared ask for a refund.)I don’t know yet whether the news about the dictionary means that perhaps the worst of those days might soon be behind us. But it certainly feels like progress, to the benefit of us all. It doesn’t mean we all have to use the slang, but we can if want to. It’s more freedom, and more choice to say more things, such as: “Imagine if they let me write bare slang in the . It’s gonna be lit, the Opinion section would be looking peng.”• Coco Khan is a commissioning editor and columnist for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2324170e9ea60f30f8c0cb54ee32718d67090cad/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=768bc0eb360dee42b509b7cd1c496918","title":"tesco jacks little englandism cornish camembert jacks","story":"The new Tesco chain prides itself on its British products – but it’s really selling the myth of post-Brexit self-sufficiencyJack’s dependence on Europe goes deeper than its shelf-stackers.

From rugged clifftop peaks to sprawling, serene beaches puffins to porpoises ­– natural beauty of incredible variety and scale is everywhere. Wales is the only country in the world that boasts a walking trail ning its entire coastline. The really dedicated can tackle the whole 870 miles. You can even run it – the current record is 23 days.For those more inclined towards a gentle hike or a relaxed amble, taking in glorious sunsets from castles or viaducts, here are eight of the best coastal walks.Aberaeron to New Quay (6.5 miles)New Quay claims to be the inspiration for Llareggub, the fictional seaside village at the centre of Dylan Thomas’s masterpiece Under Milk Wood – and it is worth a visit alone so that you can make your own mind up. This easy trek between two of the loveliest fishing towns in Wales takes you through forests, waterfalls and fern, finishing at glorious Traeth Gwyn beach in New Quay. Make sure to plan your timing with the tide in mind so you get the full experience, and have time for a swim in fine weather. The Hotel Penwig boasts a seafront location and is ideal for an overnight stay or just a drink to toast a fine walk.St Govan’s chapel, Pembrokeshire, to Stackpole Quay (5.5 miles)Expect medium intensity here, mainly because of the steep steps that take you down to the mystical St Govan’s chapel, the real draw of this lovely walk. St Govan’s origins are debated, including the suggestion that he was Gawain, the legendary knight. Another story has him as an Irish Christian missionary who took shelter from pirates in these rocks and then created his monastic chapel in thanks to God for his survival. The remarkable stone structure has been as weathered by the sea as the rocks around it, but it remains in good shape. Look out for the bird life – chocolate brown guillemots and black razorbills come in the summer to breed on the cliffs. For a different wildlife experience, the walk also takes in Bosherston Lily Ponds, where house martins and swallows skim over the lily-covered fresh water. Also nearby is the beautiful Barafundle Bay – with its clear waters and expanse of golden sands, it is the closest Britain gets to the Caribbean.This short and slightly steep walk is well worth it. One of the best views in Wales awaits you, only a small, well-signposted distance from the town of Barmouth, which was a favourite of the poet William Wordsworth. At the summit, you’ll have a view of the dramatic upland landscape of Cadair Idris, as well as the Mawddach Estuary, but be sure to make time for the spectacular wooden Barmouth Bridge. It is just over 150 years old and, at 699 metres long, it is Britain’s longest wooden railway bridge. You can walk or cycle over the bridge for free.Mumbles to Three Cliffs Bay (12.5 miles)This is a long walk made easy thanks to the well-maintained path. Three Cliffs Bay is a perfect example of the particular charms of the Welsh coastline – the wildness, the feeling of being outside of time, the awe-inspiring peace. This walk is the perfect summer outing, and the bay provides a picturesque picnic location that would be hard to beat. The Gower Coast Path has many highlights, and this scenic walk is one of the most breathtaking.Holyhead to Trearddur Bay (12 miles)You are spoiled for idyllic walks in Anglesey and this stretch offers a perfect mix of cliff-hiking and open coastal views. You begin in the impressive Holyhead Breakwater country park, built on the site of an old quarry. Regular exhibitions and displays offer information about the local wildlife – which include falcons and peregrines – to any accompanying little ones, and a friendly cafe with local suppliers will set you up for the day. The entire Anglesey coastline is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and this walk has some of the most breathtaking views. Visit South Stack lighthouse to watch the breeding seabirds on the cliffs and experience the full drama of wind and sea. You can also get guided tours of the lighthouse. Once you’ve arrived at your destination, a stay at the seafront Trearddur Bay hotel is highly recommended.The Glamorgan Heritage Coast is so-called because it’s been recognised as an area of notable natural beauty or scientific significance, and walking it you can see exactly why. It’s as much a treat for amateur geologists as it is for keen walkers. You’ll pass by Dunraven Castle, and although it hasn’t survived intact, it makes for a striking and almost magical scene. If you decide to do the full walk, make sure you’re aware of the tides as they can take you by surprise. The Blue Anchor is the perfect traditional countryside pub for a pie and a pint when you’re done.Conwy to Llandudno (18 miles)This ambitious walk is perfect for experienced long-distance hikers, but the route is also easy to ide into smaller sections for those who only have an afternoon. It will take you up the Conwy River estuary and around the Great Orme, allowing for spectacular views of the north Wales coastline. As well as being a scenic delight, this is a walk for the historically minded – Llandudno has managed to keep its briny Victorian charms intact, and Conwy boasts an imposing medieval castle built in the 13th century.A very good walk based around some of Dylan Thomas’s old haunts, taking you via the River Taf and a Norman castle. The Dylan Thomas Boathouse is a must-see, bound to inspire those of a poetic bent – and the deck is the perfect place to sit with a coffee to take in the estuary. Laugharne Castle is a well-preserved and strikingly beautiful site, with a glorious view from the top of the tower. On your return, why not enjoy a beer in famous literary watering hole Brown’s hotel, where Thomas entertained his fellow writers and students.

The audit also said he had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and claimed unjustified expenses.The development comes amid growing concern among some UN Environment officials, with sources claiming his “haphazard and dictatorial management style” has “already made us dysfunctional in many respects”.Solheim told the  he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and made changes where other rules had been broken. He said he could not comment in detail on the audit until it was completed and published: “If any other mistakes are found, we will immediately correct them.”Responding to staff concern over his leadership of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), he said: “To secure unprecedented environmental action, we need to change, as iniduals, as society, indeed as the UN. No one is immune to the difficulty that type of systemic change often brings.”The draft audit, leaked to the , was compiled by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and will be finalised after responses from the iniduals named. It is particularly critical of Solheim’s frequent flying, which included a weekend trip from the US to France and back.It also said Unep, unlike several other UN organisations, did not have policies and incentives for staff to reduce their carbon emissions. In August, Solheim told a Norwegian aviation magazine, people should not have a “guilty conscience” about flying and said he held gold frequent flyer cards at all three major airline alliances.“This is simply embarrassing,” said Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace in Norway. “Solheim has made Unep much more visible, which is a good thing, partly through travels and discussions with so many people. But this report puts him in an extremely bad light and weakens the credibility of UN’s entire environmental organisation.” Solheim said: “Making good on our global agenda demands engagement with the world and indeed an expanded approach to our work. I am therefore determined to continue to focus on our mandate to create real results for real people, with real impact on the ground.”The draft OIOS audit also criticises Solheim’s management style as “having no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules, and correspondence seen showed management willingness to circumvent regulations and rules which were termed as ‘bureaucratic’.”The audit said Solheim’s travel had been approved by a manager who reported directly to him, not someone more senior. “We have immediately put new procedures in place whereby my travel is approved by the office of the secretary general,” Solheim told the .The audit also said Solheim had not provided justification for 76 days spent in Oslo and Paris on official travel. After a request from a UN official to account for days spent in his home country, Norway, Solheim, emailed: “We cannot accept this question on holiday vs job … we are not any longer living in the industrial age and they must stop treating me as if I am a 07 to 16 factory worker … the other side of this coin is that they must stop asking this stupid question.”Solheim told the : “It’s true that I have vented frustration with what I perceive as excessive bureaucracy in the UN system. I believe fully in reforming the UN so we’re better able to confront the urgent challenges facing our planet.” But he added: “If administrative rules are found to have been overlooked, I accept personal responsibility and offer my unflinching commitment to refining a process that prevents them from ever occurring again.”The OIOS report also criticises Solheim for allowing two senior managers to work unofficially from Paris, rather than Unep headquarters in Nairobi. A source said staff saw this arrangement as the managers “getting away with murder”.In one case, the unofficial teleworking resulted in additional travel costs of $23,750, according to the draft audit. Questioned by officials over the unofficial arrangement in emails seen by the , Solheim said: “Please blame it on the erratic executive director.”On another occasion, discussing management reform, Solheim emailed colleagues to say: “There is no need to be the most legalistic implementer of nonsense. Very often it is easier to get forgiveness for non compliance than to get permission for change.”Numerous Unep staff have contacted the , on condition of anonymity, criticising Solheim’s leadership of the organisation, which is governed and funded by UN member states.“He thinks he is a CEO when he is actually an international civil servant,” said one source. “A lot of us were very excited when he came.

Fashion is going through a phase of elevating non-fashion pieces into catwalk pieces there have been seasons of hoodies and anoraks, and fashion weeks awash with ugly trainers. Now it’s the turn of the ultimate corporate uniform, the skirt suit.The only way to play it, I think, is straight. No weird trainers or kooky socks. A slogan T-shirt is not your friend here. For heaven’s sake, please don’t even think about a bumbag. Nor do you want to be buttoned up: if the jacket works as a top half without a blouse underneath, as it does here, and the fabric weight is such that you think you can get through the day without spontaneously combusting, then wearing just the skirt and jacket gives the outfit some room to breathe.A double-breasted jacket or a long-line jacket with a tie belt is a good starting point to carry the suit into non-dreary territory. As for the skirt, hemline length is key. A two-piece with a skirt that finishes too precisely on the knee has a tendency to look like regulation school uniform. A longer-length skirt suit might sound off-puttingly dowdy but it looks, in fact, like fashion. And not, thank goodness, in an ironic way.

Well, regular in one sense but not in another given that it is Rúben Neves and Diogo Jota who are sitting in front of a plate of delicious Portuguese custard tarts – pastéis de nata to give them their real name – talking about cricket.For Jota and Neves, who joined Wolves in July last year after playing together at Porto, this little corner of the Black Country feels like home away from home. Hélder Costa, another member of the sizeable Portuguese contingent at the club, is credited with discovering the place, which opened 13 months ago. Monica, who is from Porto, could not have timed things better in that respect, although she has no interest in football and was oblivious to the fact that a number of her customers were household names and worth millions of pounds until she saw her boyfriend talking to them one day and asked how he knew them.Neves and Jota, who got to know each other playing for Portugal’s Under-21s, are terrific company. Humble and affable, they speak with such maturity that is easy to forget they are only 21 years old. At times they are like a married couple as they finish off one another’s sentences, no more so than when the conversation turns to the slightly awkward question of how they compare the city of Wolverhampton with Porto.“It’s not possible to compare, it’s completely different,” Neves says, diplomatically. “In Porto it’s a tourist city. It’s close to the river, the ocean as well, there’s a lot of history. The wine and the food also. And here it’s an industrial city. But we’re fine with it. We want to play football … in the best league in the world, so the city doesn’t matter,” Jota adds. “And we have a good home and our family with us,” continues Neves.The overriding impression is that Neves and Jota could not be happier. Jota talks about how much more comfortable he is off the field in Wolverhampton than in Porto, where the level of attention was suffocating at times, and both remark on how refreshing it is to be in a league where the ball is in play a lot more. “Time-wasting is one of the worst things that we have in Portugal,” Jota says, sighing. “For example, when we played against Manchester City we still wanted to play when we had Jonny injured. But in Portugal, you’ll get a lot of players ‘injured’.”The follow-up question prompts Neves and Jota to react with laughter and a sense of incredulity. Given that their manager is also Portuguese, does he ever get invited to the birthday dinners? “Nooooooooo!” the two respond in unison, looking flabbergasted. “You can’t cross that line,” Jota says, smiling.Their level of respect for Nuno, who also managed them at Porto, shines through when they talk about him. “He’s a really intense and ambitious coach,” Neves says. “I think the most important thing is the motivation – he’s always motivated to do his best all the time. Even when we’re playing good, he wants us to play better. I think this makes the difference with him.”Everything comes a lot more easily with a ball at their feet. Neves has caught the eye this season with his wonderful range of passing, and it feels a matter of time before Jota, Wolves’ top scorer last season, opens his Premier League account. “We want to make ourselves look good in the best league in the world,” Jota says. “When it was our first game, against Everton, I was very emotional, because it really means something for me. When I came on to the field, I thought: ‘I’m here’.”Saturday’s visit to Old Trafford promises to be another special occasion, especially with José Mourinho in the opposite dugout. Neves, who grew up supporting Porto, can vividly remember their 2004 Champions League triumph under Mourinho, even though he was only seven. “I watched the final with my family,” he says. “We went into Porto to celebrate because all my family are fans. Mourinho is a legend at Porto.”Rather surprisingly neither Neves nor Jota has spoken to Mourinho, despite plenty of common ground, including when it comes to their agent. Jorge Mendes represents all three of them and it is interesting listening to Jota’s response when asked how important Mendes is from a player perspective.“He’s like my right arm,” Jota says. “I think from a player’s point of view, you feel you are with the best at his job. I feel there is no one better than him to manage my career, so I have nothing to worry about – just to do my job on the field. When you speak with him, he’s really ambitious and he says that you can always do more. He’s very confident and believes in you more than you do yourself sometimes.”Monica could probably do with Mendes’s help, too, because sadly Aromas de Portugal is on the market. Monica’s father is ill and the family have asked her to return home, meaning that she is trying to find a new owner. All the catering equipment is included in the price and the same goes for a distinguished list of regular customers, provided the place remains in Portuguese hands. “We hope it does,” says Neves. “We have alternatives. But the best place for us is here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/596aab0c042112db74ee7e3cd349616196003a86/307_21_2469_1481/master/2469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ead03e7e833f2234ce84c389815f18","title":"sergio aguero signs manchester city contract extension one year 2021","story":"Pep Guardiola has revealed Benjamin Mendy has an injured fifth metatarsal, with Manchester City’s manager unsure how long the left-back will be out.The 24-year-old has missed the past two games. It is understood the problem is bruising in the left foot and minor. Guardiola, asked for how long Mendy would be unavailable, said: “I don’t know it – he has a problem in his bone.”Guardiola welcomed the news that Sergio Agüero had signed a one-year contract extension to stay City until 2021. If the striker sees out the deal it would mean he will have been at City for a decade, having joined from Atlético Madrid in summer 2011.The 30-year-old has scored three goals in six appearances this season and has drawn praise from Guardiola for his all-round game, an area the manager has been keen for Agüero to improve. “I am so happy he has signed a new contract and can stay 10 years at the club,” Guardiola said.The sentiment from Agüero, City’s all-time leading goalscorer, was similar. “My idea was being here for 10 years,” he said. “I’ve been here for seven years, it’s going to be 10 when the contract expires. This was the main reason I signed. I’m very happy because they have treated my very well since the first day I got here.”City suffered a surprise 2-1 home defeat to Lyon in Wednesday’s opening Champions League group game. Yet Guardiola defended his team, saying they were not required to say sorry.“The players don’t have to apologise,” he said. “Why should they? They ran, they fought, tried to make a comeback. The competition punishes the mistakes. We made a lot of mistakes. But they don’t have to apologise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5db320e10cb17ccdcf65dff1d049405aa31ecf/403_57_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d74ce2036964ca4473bda46d0d32d5","title":"liverpool impress ronaldo ridiculousness and cows cows cows football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Jonathan Wilson to discuss the Champions League, Ronaldo’s red, the timekeeping skills of cows and Mark Hughes’s elusive smileJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

After last week’s 1-0 victory at Huddersfield, in which he scored but was again fouled, this time by Mathias Jorgensen, Zaha said: “I’d have to get my leg broken for anyone to get a card. That’s why I lose my head. Why am I getting different treatment from other players?”Gary Lineker said that he should take the intense attention he receives as a “compliment”, but the incident was the latest in which he appears to have been targeted. Watford’s Etienne Capoue had already been accused by Graeme Souness of trying to “nail” Zaha in a fixture earlier this season. That he has already been fouled 11 times since it began has contributed to concerns about the treatment he receives, but Palace will regardless resist contacting Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) to demand greater protection for their most influential player. “People are entitled to say what they think, if it is heartfelt and honest,” said Hodgson. “It is the person making the comment who has to stand for that, and I don’t think it is for others to chip in and make comments about it.“He said what he had to say and he has no reason to apologise for that. We want to move on from there. Let’s hope that he will survive the coming matches in the way he wants to. Our chances are better with him in the team.“After every game, clubs are asked to comment and send in a report on the game. I’m pretty certain we did that, as we do after every game. But there’s been no specific contact with the Premier League or Mike Riley and his people at all. I see no reason for that. We’ve not made any overtures to the Premier League or the PGMOL.”This just in: Oscar Tabarez has signed up for another four years in charge of Uruguay’s national team, which will take him up to Qatar 2022. The 71-year-old, who suffers from “a chronic neuropathy” which means he is no longer able to walk without a stick or crutches, has been in charge of Uruguay for the past 12 years. Jonathan WIlson wrote this tribute to “a man who somehow includes on his CV both being a primary school teacher and holding a raging Gabriel Batistuta back by the nipple during a riot in Santiago” during the most recent World Cup. The Spanish FA have dug in against La Liga by declaring there is “zero per cent chance” that the planned match between Girona and Barcelona in Miami will go ahead on 27 January.La Liga had intended to take the fixture to Florida without consulting the Spanish players’ union (AFE) or the FA. Luis Rubiales, head of the Spanish FA, has announced his intention to block the proposal, with the backing of Uefa and Fifa. His La Liga counterpart, Javier Tebas, remains confident that the game will go ahead in Miami, rather than Girona. ““Uefa haven’t announced their stance publicly,” he said. “Fifa don’t have legal authority and we are negotiating with the AFE.” Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez is confident referee Andre Marriner will not be influenced by Crystal Palace striker Wilfried Zaha’s pleas for protection and expressed mild surprise that the player has not been sanctioned for his very public complaints.“I’m surprised because normally the FA deal with these comments, but I have a lot of confidence in Andre Marriner,” said Benitez. “He has experience - even if his record with our players is not the best in terms of red cards. But I am quite confident. He is a very good referee with experience and he will deal with the situation in a normal way.”Benitez insisted the Magpies would not change their plans to deal with Zaha in the wake of his comments. “Not really,” he said. “He’s a good player, no doubt about that, but I think the FA has to deal with these comments and I’m sure that Andre Marriner will not have this in the back of his head.”The Manchester City manager has been speaking to the press and said he was delighted with this morning’s news that Sergio Aguero has signed a contract extension that – if he sees it out – will see in his 10th anniversary as a City player.“I really appreciate it a lot,” said Guardiola. “I am so happy he has signed a new contract and can stay 10 years at the club. City’s manager refused to criticise his players for losing against Lyon in their Champions League opener, which he was forced to watch from the stands as he was serving a touchline ban. “The players don’t have to apologise. ,” he said. “They tried to make a comeback. They put everything in. The ban - I have to accept it. Hopefully next time I can be there.”Jurgen Klopp has insisted there are no concerns over Mohamed Salah’s early season form and the Liverpool forward’s defensive work in the wins over Paris Saint Germain and Tottenham Hotspur was “outstanding”.The Egypt international has yet to recapture the prolific form that yielded 44 goals last term but has scored twice in his six appearances so far. At the same stage of last season Salah had scored three goals. “Wow, that’s a crisis,” said the Liverpool manager – sarcastically of course – when told of the comparison.Klopp said: “On the defensive side he was outstanding in the last two games, perfect, and it is so important in these games especially so that says everything about him: that he is really ready to work for the team in these moments. It is a completely normal situation for an offensive player that they have times when they don’t score. But he is still a threat, has fantastic situations in both games and he is in a good shape. Finishing is something you can never take for granted I would never do that, the players should never do that – only the supporters are allowed to do that. The most important thing is physically he is in a very good shape, which helps.”Salah has not scored in his last three outings and was substituted shortly after his error led to Kylian Mbappe equalising for PSG in the Champions League on Tuesday.But his manager added: “Yes he lost the ball before we conceded the second goal but it was a very intense game and things like this happen constantly. You don’t always concede a goal after it but this time we did. It was not the reason to take him off. I am fine with him, I think he is fine with me and the situation, so that’s all. At the end of the season we will see how it was, not at the beginning. The start was good for the team and also him as well. It wasn’t like he finished last season but he needed time last year and we will take time this year, that’s all.”The Liverpool manager confirmed Roberto Firmino is fit to start against Southampton on Saturday and Dominic Solanke is also available having recovered from concussion. Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana and Divock Origi remain sidelined by injury, however.Leicester boss Claude Puel has vowed to stick with a four-man defence against Huddersfield despite calls from fans to switch to three at the back.Since last weekend’s 4-2 defeat at Bournemouth, where Puel’s team were 4-0 down heading into the final five minutes, local radio phone-ins and fan forums have been inundated with supporters suggesting playing three central defenders could be the way forward.Leicester were vulnerable to the counter-attack against the Cherries as attacking full-backs Ricardo Pereira and Ben Chilwell went forward with no cover, leaving Wes Morgan and Harry Maguire exposed. With Morgan suspended after his red card at the Vitality Stadium, it might have been the perfect opportunity to try a new formation, but Puel insists he will stick to his guns on Saturday and not make decisions based solely on last weekend’s result.“I am not in the habit to change something,” said the Frenchman. “For example, about our last game, if I change the system defensively just to find a good solidity, we could lose all the good aspects from the offensive play.“With four at the back, we can drive the play. I want to keep our quality and possibility to attack and then correct our game in the defensive aspect: win duels, more aggressiveness, these good things. They are good ingredients.“Changing the system sometimes, why not? But it is not my concern or my thought at this moment because we made mistakes and we know why we made them. I think it is important to be responsible and correct the mistakes.“All the systems are possible, but I think the desire for me is the mentality, the play, the philosophy. That is the most important thing in football.”Huddersfield boss David Wagner has yet to decide whether or not to recall midfielder Jonathan Hogg for Saturday’s game at Leicester. Hogg has completed a three-match ban and will return to the squad as the Terriers chase their first Premier League win of the season, but Wagner said Aaron Mooy and Philip Billing could resume in central midfield.Huddersfield have struggled in front of goal this season, scoring in just two of their first five league games, but Wagner insisted he has been pleased with his side’s performances.“If you are not scoring goals, are you creating opportunities?” he added. “If not, you have to work on that. If you are, you have to work on finishing them off and this is exactly what we have done. As long as you create opportunities, this is what we have to try to prove against Leicester.”Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe maintains his squad still have plenty of room for improvement despite enjoying their best ever start to a Premier League campaign.The Cherries head to bottom club Burnley in fifth place following last weekend’s 4-2 win over Leicester. Three victories and a draw from the opening five matches makes impressive reading - but Howe is not about to let anyone’s focus slip.“It has been a good start, there is no denying that,” he said. “We are happy with what we have done and delivered, but there is more to come from the team. There are better performances in us, and iniduals can do even better, so although it has been good to this point, I am still looking for this team to grow. I have always believed that no matter where you are or what you are doing, there is always room to improve. How can we push things on again?“We are never going to be the finished product. You are always looking to take the team to the next step. It is so early in the season, no conclusions can be drawn yet and it is all to be proved.”Asked about their opponents on Saturday, a team he once managed briefly, Howe seemed confident they will rouse themselves from their current slump.“In terms of performances, they are strong and are a very disciplined team,” said Howe. “When they are functioning well, they are a tough team to beat, as a lot of sides found out last year. I don’t think they will be in that position for long.” Leeds have got off to a flyer under the fascinating reign of Marcelo Bielso, but many observers have questioned whether or not the Championship leaders will be physically able to maintain the levels of intensity the Argentinian demands until the end of the season. Bielsa himself touched on these concerns as he spoke to the media today, ahead of Leeds match against Birmingham City, at Elland Road this weekend.“The Championship is a long season and it is not a sprint,” he said. “Birmingham are a team that concedes very few goals, so that is an important difficulty for us, and the few goals that Birmingham have conceded, doesn’t correspond with their league ranking. The Blues, along with Ipswich, are one of just two teams in the Championship who have yet to record a win this season. “Garry Monk was the head coach of Leeds when they finished seventh in the Championship and has been the head coach of several teams, so he is experienced,” added Bielsa.Javi Gracia insists his Watford side remain mentally strong after their perfect start to the new Premier League campaign came to an end. The Hornets will look to get back to winning ways quickly at Fulham in Saturday’s televised lunchtime kick-off after seeing Manchester United inflict a first defeat on them last weekend. Gracia’s well-drilled squad are only three points behind leaders Chelsea and Liverpool, so the Spaniard sees no reason not to remain positive.“We had a good performance last week regardless of the result,” he said. “We played well - we didn’t get a good result, but I’m pleased with the performance. After four wins in a row, the team is mentally strong. They don’t need to get a good result to know we are doing good performances.“Now in this moment, we are confident of keeping our level. We try to get better results knowing it will not be easy. We are training really well. Mentally, the team is strong and has the confidence it needs to take the result.”Fulham were beaten 3-0 at Manchester City last time out, a third Premier League defeat on their return to the top flight. Slavisa Jokanovic’s men, though, won their previous home match 4-2 against Burnley. Gracia is not expecting an easy afternoon by the Thames as Jokanovic prepares to tackle his former club.“Fulham are playing really well, so I know it will be a tough game, but we are going to compete,” said the Spaniard. “They are a team who like possession, have an average of 54 or 55 per cent, and with a style of play where they are organised. We have to be ready to defend well when we don’t have possession, but we will see what happens. We try to keep our style of play, our mentality and to be aggressive.” Southampton boss Mark Hughes believes his side can head to Anfield confident of giving Premier League high-flyers Liverpool plenty of cause for concern.Their opponents this weekend maintained their perfect start to the new campaign with a more-emphatic-than-the-scoreline-suggests 3-2 Champions League win over Paris St Germain.Southampton, meanwhile, are unbeaten from the last three matches - but were left frustrated after allowing a 2-0 lead to slip at home on Monday night as Brighton fought back to earn a draw with a stoppage-time penalty. “It is a game that is going to test us clearly because the team we are facing looks on top of their form, with iniduals and the collective functioning really well,” the Southampton manager said at a press conference.“But we will go there with the intentions of causing them problems and maybe taking chances when we are presented with them, because in most games we are creating opportunities, that has not really been a problem for us. “You would like to think if we can remain in the game and have a good platform, that will enable us to create chances and take chances if they come around. Liverpool are in outstanding form at the moment and if it was a great performance in Europe.“It’s going to be a big test for us, we understand that - but we are on a decent run in terms of confidence. “Yes, Monday night was a disappointment, but it does not affect us confidence-wise. If we had been dominated in the game and poor for long periods, which was not the case, we would have been more concerned going up against an in-form Liverpool team.”Fulham will give Ryan Sessegnon time to “grow up” and adapt to the Premier League, according to boss Slavisa Jokanovic. The 18-year-old Craven Cottage sensation could pass 100 Fulham appearances this season, already his third full senior campaign.The England Under-21 talent had a host of top clubs courting his services in the summer, but opted to stay put in south west London. Manager Jokanovic has called for calm however, as the left winger starts to realise his rich potential.“It is a new experience for him, he has come from one level to another: it’s not time to rest, it’s time to continue with this learning process,” Jokanovic told Sky Sports.“He must understand the difference between the Championship and the Premier League. It’s a huge experience for him, all the minutes he is getting. We must be calm with him and give him space to grow up. He’s a little bit more experienced now but there’s huge space for him to reach his best level.”Matej Vydra has been speaking about Burnley’s poor start to the season and has admitted the team’s strikers need to start pulling their weight as they bid for their first Premier League win of the season, against Bournemouth tomorrow. Sean Dyche’s side sit bottom of the table with only one point from five games, and they have not been helped by the combined failure of Vydra, Ashley Barnes, Chris Wood and Sam Vokes to find the net in the league. “Especially for the strikers, when you score goals, when you have opportunities almost every game, you believe more in yourself that a goal will come, and if you score one or two then your confidence is high, you feel much better on the training pitch and during the games,” said Vydra. The Czech is playing for his fifth English club after moving to Turf Moor from Derby in an £11m deal last month, and has settled in quickly despite the difficult start to the season.“I think I was a little bit scared when I came here,” he said. “New club, new manager, you have to meet so many new people, but in the group it’s very good guys, no big egos and was more easy than I expected and I’m more happy than I was thinking. It was a hard start for us, Europa League and Premier League, it’s not going well for us but when I came here from the first session and after that I said, ‘Wow, there’s good players here’. We show it on the training pitch and now we have to bring it to the pitch.” Chelsea’s preparations for Sunday’s Premier League clash at West Ham were disrupted after the team were forced to delay their return from Greece.Maurizio Sarri’s side had planned to fly out straight after Thursday’s 1-0 win at PAOK, but adverse weather conditions in the UK saw Chelsea postpone their return flight until Friday morning. They were scheduled to land late on Friday afternoon.Chelsea have five wins from five Premier League games ahead of the derby at the London Stadium. Head coach Sarri hinted at his frustration over the proximity of Sunday’s fixture - and that was before the flight delay emerged.“We have to play again in 63 hours, on Sunday morning,” Sarri said after the game in Thessaloniki. Eden Hazard and David Luiz were rested for the trip and so were unaffected by the flight delay. Sarri made five changes for the Europa League Group L win, rotating his options ahead of a busy period.Chelsea play at Liverpool in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday and host the Reds in the Premier League in September 29. Pedro could be rested for the West Ham game after he suffered a shoulder injury in stoppage time in Thessaloniki. However, the Spain winger tweeted to say “everything’s ok despite the incident at the end of the game”.Marcus Rashford and Nemanja Matic will miss Manchester United’s return to Premier League action against Wolves through suspension.Rashford serves the second of a three-game ban while Matic will complete a one-match suspension after being sent off at Watford last weekend. Both players started Wednesday’s Champions League win at Young Boys, where Antonio Valencia and Jesse Lingard were rested.The duo are back in contention on Saturday when Phil Jones could return, but Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo are not fit to be involved. United boss Jose Mourinho confirmed Diogo Dalot will not start despite impressing on his debut in Switzerland and will instead start next week’s Carabao Cup match against Derby.Manchester United’s manager has been talking to the ladies and gentlemen of the Fourth Estate ahead of his side’s intriguing match against Wolves at Old Trafford tomorrow. Despite having masterminded three consecutive victories for a team many considered to be approaching “crisis”, he looked in decidedly morose mood. Jamie Jackson was there for the  and reports that Mourinho thinks United are resolving “defensive problems” better due to a concerted team effort rather than Victor Lindelof and Chris Smalling being selected as the centre-back pairing in their run of three successive victories.“The team is more compact, more solid, the spirit, the cooperation, the empathy, the communication all of that improves in the team and good results bring confidence. And I think we are improving as a team, I don’t want to say our improvement has the name of Chris or Victor, the team is playing better and they are part of the team that plays these matches.”On the subject of 19-year-old Diogo Dalot, who impressed on debut in Wednesday’s 3-0 win at Young Boys, Mourinho had this to say.Manchester City earned their first win of the Women’s Super League season with an emphatic win over Everton. Read on ... At the risk of going all Hello! magazine, may we take a moment to congratulate Derby County manager Frank Lampard and his wife, Christine, who have just announced the arrival of their new baby daughter, Patricia Charlotte, this morning. Cardiff City’s manager has been chatting ahead of his team’s game against Manchester City in the Welsh capital. Warnock said City got a “kick up the backside” in their shock 2-1 home defeat to Lyon in midweek to become the first English side to lose four consecutive Champions League matches. “It’s a blip and might give them a kick up the backside,” Warnock said at his pre-match press conference. “I don’t think it helps us at all. They made a few changes and looked a lot stronger when they put the regulars on in the second half. When I watch them I think ‘thank goodness we only play them twice!”’Pedro is a major doubt for Chelsea’s Premier League clash at West Ham on Sunday. The Spain winger sustained a shoulder injury in Thursday night’s Europa League win at PAOK - a trip Eden Hazard and David Luiz missed.The rested pair are expected to return against the Hammers, while Mateo Kovacic has a minor injury and may miss out again. Chelsea’s return to England has been delayed after their scheduled post-match flight was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions. Pascal Gross remains Brighton’s only absentee ahead of Saturday’s Premier League clash with Tottenham. The German midfielder, who missed Monday’s draw at Southampton, is sidelined with an ankle injury sustained against Fulham before the international break. Winger Jose Izquierdo and forward Florin Andone are awaiting their first appearances of the season after returning to fitness.Unai Emery is likely to recall a number of first-team regulars for Arsenal’s Premier League clash at home to Everton on Sunday. The Spaniard made eight changes for Thursday’s 4-2 Europa League win over Vorskla Poltava but the likes of Petr Cech, Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil and Alexandre Lacazette will be pushing for returns.Lucas Torreira took a knock to the knee during the game but Emery hopes he will be fine to face the Toffees, while Laurent Koscielny (achilles), Sead Kolasinac (knee), Ainsley Maitland-Niles (leg) and Carl Jenkinson (ankle) remain absent.Fulham take on Watford at Craven Cottage in tomorrow’s lunchtime kick-off and will be without Tom Cairney and Neeskens Kebano. Cairney continues to nurse a foot concern, with Kebano still unable to shake off an ankle problem. Defender Tim Ream is back in training after a thigh injury but will not be fully fit in time to feature against the Hornets. Sean Dyche’s team entertain Bournemouth at Turf Moor this weekend as they attempt to kick-start their season by getting a win on the board. If they are to increase their tally of one point accrued from five games, they will have to do so without Ben Gibson, who has been ruled out after undergoing minor surgery for a hernia and will be absent for several weeks.Midfielder Steven Defour and winger Robbie Brady continued their comebacks from long-term absences with appearances in a game at the training ground on Thursday but are not yet ready for the first team. Led by Max Rushden, our crack team of podcasters got up at 4.30am yesterday following their live show in Oslo, to get the red-eye back to London in time to record the latest thrilling instalment of Football Weekly ...

You can listen here ... and if you’re not already a subscriber, please sign up in the usual pod places. We bring Manchester City fans good news from the Etihad Stadium, where it has been confirmed that Sergio Aguero has inked a new one-year deal with with the club. The Argentinian striker has already been at the club for seven years and will have completed a decade of service if he sees out the new deal, which will take him up to 2021. Aguero, 30, became City’s record goalscorer last season and has won three Premier League titles and scored 204 times since joining the club from Atletico Madrid in 2011. “I am happy for this additional year,” he said. “My idea was being here for 10 years. I’ve been here for seven years, it’s going to be 10 when the contract expires.“This was the main reason I signed. I’m very happy because they have treated me very well since the first day I got here. I’m very happy with everything that involves the club, my team-mates, the staff and the management team. We have a good team, we need to be focused and if we are at 100 per cent, we have lots of chances to do great things.”Our Reni hat-wearing man on the Manchester beat, Jamie Jackson, has more details.Welcome to our rolling blog o’news, in which we’ll bring you all the football news that’s fit to print and some that almost certainly isn’t as we look ahead to the weekend’s action.We’ll have updates and fact-asms from assorted pre-match press briefings, get news from the provinces and elsewhere with occasional looks at the local press and flag up anything else that catches our eye as the hours roll by.

I don’t know what made me associate rubber with sex but I began masturbating with it, and ever since, my sex life has been wonderfully enhanced.As a teenager I felt abnormal, until I came across fetish magazines like AtomAge, Shiny and Smooth, filled with pictures of people wearing latex clothes, and I realised, with relief, there were others like me.I’m in my 60s now, and although society is becoming more tolerant of less conventional forms of sexuality, like BDSM, rubber – and fetishism in general – remains socially unacceptable. There are certain objects – high heels, tight skirts, leather clothes – that can verge on the fetishistic, but perhaps these are more acceptable because they are part of everyday wardrobes.The characteristics of rubber – the fact that it gets hot or cold depending on the air temperature – work against it as a fashion material. A common theme in online forums is: “How can I tell my partner?”, the fear being that our partners will find us beyond the pale. I am fortunate to have a partner – of over 30 years – who, while not enthusiastic about my passion for rubber, tolerates it. She accepts that I wear latex clothing and she will sometimes – although not as often as I would like! – wear latex herself.My rubber fetish is fun, wonderful and an integral part of me: I can’t be “cured”, and I don’t want to be.

The most popular baby names of 2017 have been announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and while Olivia, Oliver and Muhammad – in its varied spellings – remain the most likely names to be heard shouted across the nation’s playgrounds in years to come, the inventiveness of parents shows no sign of slowing down.Aurora, Lyla, Orla, Edith and Hallie enter the top 100 girls’ names, while for boys, popular names include Leo, which enters the top 10, and Ralph, moving into the top 100.Sarah, the most popular name for girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, has dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since records began in 1904.Parents in England and Wales gave 28,222 different names to the 348,071 boys born last year, and 35,475 to the 331,035 girls. More parents seem to be aiming for something celestial, with Luna and Aria among the fastest-rising girls’ names in the past decade.The biggest climber was Harper, the name David and Victoria Beckham gave to their youngest child in 2011. Music and sport often provide inspiration, with 35 parents plumping for Kendrick for boys – perhaps with the rapper Kendrick Lamar in mind – and 50 calling their boys Kobe, possibly after the basketball player Kobe Bryant.However, the British political class does not inspire people so much. There is no Boris, Jeremy or Theresa in either of the top 100s, although Jacob was the sixth-most popular name in 2017, a year in which the arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has grown in popularity in some quarters. There were only 11 Nigels born last year, compared with 50 Winstons.The names given to the newborns of England and Wales present a different and more erse picture than those registered when Britain joined the EU in 1973. Back then, Michael and Jennifer were the most popular names.There is also considerable regional variation. In Gwynedd, north Wales, Hari is the most popular name given to boys. In Blackburn, it is Zainab for girls. Amelia and Muhammad are most popular in Birmingham, Jack and Olivia in Bristol, and Arthur, Oscar, Florence and Lily in Tunbridge Wells.Muhammad was the 10th most popular name for boys, but if the alternative spellings of Mohammed or Mohammad were included, it would be about as popular as Oliver and its variants, such as Olly, across England and Wales, the ONS said.Two names that do not appear in the top 100s are Walt and Boo, the twins born this week to Chris Evans and Natasha Shishmanian, who had earlier nicknamed the boy and girl Ping and Pong, which do not appear either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/821b6a882fc232cebe84a7a8214dfe33d1835a06/16_264_1947_1167/master/1947.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3646877474773066cd9d51dbafc8a5f1","title":"power of youtube learn to mend repair fix","story":"My generation don’t mend – but I’ve made myself a promise to replace an item only if attempting to rescue it is futileCome with me as we take a trip back in time to a magical place of yore, where the impossible is possible. Let us go to the vacuum cleaner repair shop.Short of a time machine, this week’s visit was the next best thing. Clunky, secondhand Hoovers filled the floor, propped up against their boxes, while pairs of Henry eyes followed me across the room. Even the man who worked there looked surprised. “We don’t usually get people your age coming in,” he said, before looking away with an expression I read as: “We don’t usually get any people at all.”You see, I’m part of the throwaway generation. My lot don’t mend or make do we’re “a lost generation” in a disposable world, as one scientist put it. I’m not convinced by this. I’m sure it was the manufacturers who introduced built-in obsolescence. But if it wasn’t millennials who invented throwaway culture, perhaps we might bring an end to it – what with our concern for the environment, perpetual broke-ness and the knowledge that the workshop look is #hot on Instagram.Anyway, I’m giving it a go. I’ve made myself a promise to replace an item only if trying to rescue it is futile. And I’m not just leaving it to the pros: oh no, I’m going to pick up a skill or two myself. By the power of YouTube, I will learn to mend, repair and fix. It’s such a thrill, making things work. I’ve already had a go at plenty: my car tyre the toaster that didn’t keep the bread down my cracked iPhone screen. It still gives me a buzz when I hold it now, gleaming and looking good as new. I’m not sure it’s not just a low-level electric shock, but I’ll take it.I feel liberated. I’m reminded of my old neighbour from the flat upstairs. Appalled by the cost of London compared with her native Belfast, she enrolled on a plumbing basics course. “I am not paying 80 quid for someone to change a washer that only cost 50p,” she said. She was generous with her skills, too. If you needed to get a plumber in, she’d offer to be there to make sure you weren’t ripped off. No one could put a chill into a plumber’s heart quite like Siobhan talking about stopcocks.“Most of the time it’s just a blockage somewhere,” the man in the shop says, shoving a broom handle down the pipe. There’s some jiggling before the debris falls out: some earplugs, a 2p coin, a Bacardi bottle top. Poetic, really: the broom, the original dust-busting device, rescuing its modern relative. Analogue and digital, old and new, working together in harmony.

When she takes a break and looks around, it is with the open-mouthed look of curiosity and awe that you see in many infants. Evie’s vocabulary currently consists of a repertoire of squawks and “mmm” sounds. In the past few months, she has begun to stand unaided for short periods – even taking a few steps in her walking frame – progress that fills her parents with immeasurable pride, not to mention hope for the future.Despite her baby-like demeanour, Evie is eight years old. She has Pura syndrome, a vanishingly rare developmental disorder that didn’t officially exist until four years ago. Developmental disorders affect children’s normal mental or physical development. Before she was diagnosed, all Evie’s parents knew was that she suffered from “global developmental delay”: a vague umbrella term for a set of symptoms with myriad potential causes – some, but not all of them, associated with a\u0026nbspheartbreakingly poor prognosis.Yet thanks to advances in genome sequencing, more and more families like the Walkers are receiving an accurate diagnosis for their child’s condition, and with it a clearer picture of what the future holds. In some cases, such as Evie’s, it reveals they are suffering from a completely new disease in others – albeit a minority of cases, for now – it reveals a potential treatment for a\u0026nbspcondition that had hitherto seemed untreatable.It’s not only children with developmental disorders whose lives are being transformed by this technology. In October 2018, NHS England will launch its Genomic Medicine Service, 13 genomic medicine centres that will provide whole genome sequencing to people with undiagnosed rare diseases and cancer – another disease of mutated genes.By uncovering the exact genomic changes driving tumour growth, doctors can choose more effective treatments. In so doing, the NHS says England will become one of the first countries in the world to routinely offer “comprehensive and equitable access to the latest in genomic testing and management for the whole country, regardless of condition and where people live”. People with developmental diseases and cancer will be the first to benefit, but as our understanding of genetics grows, the infrastructure will be in place for the testing of other disorders as well, such as early onset dementia or multiple sclerosis, which may be caused by several gene variants.Ever since the announcement that a first draft of the human genome had been sequenced, scientists and politicians have been claiming we’re on the threshold of a new era of personalised genomic medicine. Has it finally arrived?Evie was Alison Walker’s second child, born 15 months after her first. Walker had sailed through both pregnancies, and when Evie was delivered, a week overdue, by normal vaginal delivery, it appeared her parents had been blessed with a second healthy child – and an excellent sleeper to boot. But this attribute rapidly became a source of concern. Her parents had to wake her to feed her, and then she didn’t feed for very long. She also felt abnormally cold. Walker raised these concerns with her health visitor when Evie was five days old, and she was told to take her to hospital.Immediately, the triage nurse grabbed her and raced off down the corridor. Evie spent a week in intensive care while the medical team worked to keep her warm and fed. “We assumed it was just a little bump in the road, that she’d get better, and then we’d go home with our gorgeous little girl and all would be well,” says Walker.But even though Evie returned home, she remained extremely sleepy, and as she turned from infant to toddler, it became clear that she wasn’t hitting the usual developmental milestones. She regularly returned to hospital, undergoing blood tests for various hormonal and nutritional deficiencies, brain scans to detect neurological damage and genetic tests for common inherited diseases. Her parents naively assumed that one of these tests would eventually reveal how to fix Evie’s issues: “Then we started to realise that not only could we not fix it, we couldn’t figure out what the problem was to start with,” Walker says.Evie was two years old when a hospital consultant sat her parents down and broke the devastating news that not only was it unlikely that Evie would ever catch up with healthy children her age, but they wondered if she would develop much further at all. Evie still couldn’t hold her head up, stand, walk or talk – and yet, the medical tests kept returning normal results.The Walkers’ experience was traumatic but surprisingly common. A rare disease, as defined by the European Union, is one that affects fewer than five in 10,000 people. According to Rare Disease UK, there are between 6,000 and 8,000 known rare diseases – and five new ones are described in the medical literature every week. They range from well-known inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and Huntington’s disease to childhood cancers and obscure developmental disorders such as Pura syndrome. Around three-quarters of rare diseases affect children, and a third of those born affected will not survive to see their fifth birthday.One thing that has changed is the development of next-generation sequencing technology. DNA-sequencing machines don’t sequence the whole genome in one go. Instead, the DNA is cut into short pieces, around 150 “letters” long, and the sequences of these fragments are read and then stitched together by comparing them to a reference sequence. Next-generation sequencing enables hundreds of thousands to millions or billions of these DNA-sequencing reactions to be performed simultaneously, massively speeding up the process. It’s only in the past few years that researchers have been able to sequence an entire genome in a cost-effective way.Helen Firth, a clinical geneticist at Cambridge University Hospitals, has spent her career trying to help those affected by rare diseases. “Once you’ve got a diagnosis, you can try and learn from other patients with that condition about what the future might hold,” she says. This is so you can try and tailor future medical surveillance and management of the disease, she adds, as well as “provide accurate advice to other family members about the chances of another child or family member being affected by the condition”. Yet despite her best efforts, for many years Firth could only diagnose about a quarter to a third of the patients coming through her doors. Traditionally, geneticists like Firth used a process called karyotyping, which involves pairing up and ordering all the chromosomes to see if any are missing, duplicated or contain subtler structural changes.Karyotyping remains a useful technique for pinpointing large abnormalities, but the level of resolution is limited to about 5m base pairs. Geneticists’ work became easier with the development of array technology, which enabled smaller abnormalities to be detected, with a resolution of 50,000–100,000 base pairs. However, neither of these techniques could spot tiny (but often very significant) changes, such as a single chemical letter being substituted for a different one. For this, you need DNA sequencing, a technique first developed during the 1970s. The initial sequencing of the human genome took about 13 years and cost more than £2bn. The process has become progressively faster and cheaper ever since.Even so, until recently it was only practical for clinical geneticists to sequence one gene at a time – limiting what could be achieved in an inidual patient. However, by 2010, array technology had improved and the cost of genome sequencing fallen to the point where Firth, together with Matt Hurles – who is now head of human genetics at the Wellcome Sanger Institute – believed they might be able to diagnose many more patients if these technologies were systematically applied.So, in partnership with NHS genetics services and several other research groups, they recruited more than 12,000 British children and adults with undiagnosed developmental disorders for the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study and sequenced all the gene-coding regions of their DNA. They also sequenced their parents’ DNA, enabling them to identify mutations that had occurred de novo – either during egg or sperm production or when the affected person was still an early embryo.“The question with these families has always been why so many of them have one very sick child and everyone else is healthy,” says Hurles, who leads the DDD study. “What we’ve found is that when we can make a diagnosis in these children, it’s often because of one of these new mutations.”One of those recruited was Evie Walker. She and her parents each gave a saliva sample, and the genetic sequence of each of their 20,000 genes was compared with a database of 1,450 known developmental disorder genes. Although doing this has enabled many DDD participants to receive a diagnosis, it didn’t work for Evie. Instead, for Evie and those like her with no diagnosis in the DDD study, the researchers turned to her other genes – those with no known link to disease – looking for ones containing a significant excess of de novo mutations.This led them to the Pura gene, which encodes a protein that helps regulate the expression of numerous other genes. Evie and two other girls were found to have small deletions or spelling mistakes in different areas of the Pura gene, which the researchers believed accounted for their illness. Although the girls had similar symptoms, they weren’t identical: “We’re often finding that these disorders are quite variable from one patient to the next, and this might be one reason why they haven’t been recognised before now – because a clinician couldn’t have said: these are all one thing,” says Hurles.To date, rare variants in nearly 1,500 genes have been shown to cause developmental disorders. So far, the DDD study has identified 30 new genes associated with developmental disorders and has led to the recognition of 14 entirely new disorders – although the data is still being analysed and more are likely to emerge.“It has been wonderful to have families, for whom I\u0026nbspstruggled for years to get a diagnosis, recruited to the DDD study, and then to sit in clinic with them, and actually explain the molecular diagnosis,” says Firth.As for Alison Walker, though she wanted a diagnosis for Evie, she underestimated the impact it would have on their lives: “We thought it would just be a name for what we were already living with. We didn’t expect it to be life-changing, but then when it came it really was.”In Melbourne, Australia, six-year-old Sarah Anderson was going through a diagnostic odyssey of her own. The first sign that something was wrong was when Sarah, at 36 hours old, couldn’t stay warm, was incredibly floppy, wasn’t feeding properly and would temporarily stop breathing.“I remember the geneticist coming in and saying, ‘I give her seven days enjoy her spend as much time with her as you can,’ and thinking, this wasn’t supposed to happen,” says Sarah’s mother, Mel Anderson.Fortunately, Sarah defied the odds, although as she grew older she failed to meet the normal developmental milestones and struggled to control her movements. At 14 months she developed severe epilepsy, suffering up to 20 seizures a day, which left her exhausted and made her other symptoms even worse. She was misdiagnosed with several conditions before the cost of genome sequencing fell to a point where her parents were able to fundraise the US$8,000 (£6,000) needed to get it done. Sequencing didn’t provide an immediate diagnosis, but it did narrow the search to around 20 genes – one of which was Pura.The breakthrough came when a doctor from Melbourne who knew about Sarah’s case attended a conference where early results of the DDD study were being presented. One slide listed the Pura gene along with other genes of interest. Afterwards, the doctor walked up to the presenter and said: “We’ve got one of those.” Several months of emails and telephone conversations later, Sarah’s neurologist was emailed a\u0026nbspdraft of the research paper the British researchers were putting together on this new condition. It contained a photo of the first child that they had diagnosed.“Suddenly they were more excited I think than I was,” Anderson recalls. “Our neurologist couldn’t get the words out, but then we looked at this child and … ” she takes a sharp intake of breath. The photo showed a pretty four-year-old girl, with a round face, long dark hair cut into a blunt fringe, and a slightly open mouth. Anderson thought: “That’s Sarah.” It was Evie Walker.Even though Sarah’s doctors could now give Anderson a diagnosis, they couldn’t tell her any more about what it meant. Anderson credits Sarah’s neurologist with what happened next. He said: “Find the others bring the parents together form a foundation find researchers – it’s the only way you’re going to get the answers that you need.” Things happened quickly. In the autumn of 2014, a paper describing the three British girls with Pura mutations, plus Sarah, was published. At the same time, an American group published a study describing another group of children with similar mutations. Anderson arranged to fly out and meet some of them. On that first visit, she met with seven other families, and they agreed to set up a foundation. Soon afterwards, they launched a\u0026nbspwebsite and began to register the foundation. They then reached out to any researcher they could find who had worked on the Pura gene or the protein it encoded.One of them was Dierk Niessing at the Institute of Structural Biology in Munich. Niessing had spent the early part of his career trying to solve the structure of the Pura protein and understand more about what it did. Mice that had been engineered to lack the Pura gene showed serious defects in their brains and nervous systems. The mice also tended to struggle with eating, breathing and walking.“Everything was weaker,” says Niessing. “So, my guess was that it’s an important protein, and perhaps at some point a disease would be found.”When the 2014 paper was published, he was proved correct. In 2016, the Pura Syndrome Foundation held its first conference near London, which Alison and Evie Walker attended. It was the first time Alison Walker had met Mel Anderson face-to-face. “It was like meeting a\u0026nbsplong-lost sister,” Walker says.“Initially it made me really sad to think that so many people had been through the same thing we’ve been through,” she says. “But it was nice to know, on the days when you just felt like putting your head in your hands and sobbing, that other people do understand.”The 100,000 Genomes Project was launched in England in 2012 by the then prime minister David Cameron, whose son Ivan was born with a rare neurological disorder that baffled doctors and eventually claimed his life. The goal was to sequence 100,000 genomes from patients with cancer, rare disorders and infectious diseases, both to find diagnoses and potential treatments for them, but also, in so doing, establish the infrastructure to offer routine whole genome sequencing for rare diseases and cancer within the NHS by October this year. So far, it has sequenced more than 75,000 genomes – most of them from families with undiagnosed rare diseases – and diagnoses have been returned in around a quarter of cases.One of them was a boy with severe immunodeficiency and neurological disease, who died at the age of four months. “His parents were very distressed they wanted to try and have other children, but they were very fearful of having another child like him – so they asked for themselves and the child to be enrolled in the programme,” says Mark Caulfield of Genomics England, which is charged with the delivery of the 100,000 Genomes Project. The boy’s DNA revealed a mutation in a protein that transports vitamin B12 into cells. Shortly afterwards, the mother became pregnant again, and just before the baby was born they discovered that he was carrying the same mutation. However, case reports of other children with this mutation suggested that giving high doses of vitamin B12 could overcome the problem, so this is what they did.“So far, he is developing according to the normal milestones and has not had the experience of the first child,” says Caulfield. “We begin to see how, not for all – and maybe not even for many – but for some, genome sequencing can lead to treatments.”Yet, despite the optimism, genome sequencing doesn’t provide answers for everyone. Paul Arvidson’s nine-year-old daughter, Nenna, is enrolled in both the DDD study and the 100,000 Genomes Project, yet neither has come up with any answers for why she is the way she is – at least not yet. For the family, the hardest thing is being unable to make long-term plans: “Because we haven’t got a diagnosis, we haven’t got a prognosis. We don’t know if her condition means she isn’t going to make it to adulthood, or to her teens. We want to be able to prepare for that – to know if there are things we need to think about sooner rather than later.”Also, whereas the current DNA-sequencing technology is very good at identifying single letter changes in the DNA sequence, it’s less good at spotting more than just a single letter change, or insertions or deletions.For very rare diseases, it could also be that there aren’t enough other people with the same sorts of mutation for it to be detected.With the power that sequencing brings, there is also risk. Genome sequencing carries the potential for detecting genetic variants unrelated to the condition being investigated – but which could have serious health consequences nonetheless. Some people might want to know if they have a high risk of developing a\u0026nbspserious illness down the line – particularly if there’s a\u0026nbspchance of reducing the risk – but others would prefer not to know. The DDD project made a conscious decision not to report such “secondary findings”.The 100,000 Genomes Project, however, offers its participants the option of finding out if they carry genetic variants that strongly predispose them to high cholesterol or certain cancers – such as breast and ovarian cancer, which are linked to variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes – or that might cause cystic fibrosis in future offspring.The 100,000 Genomes Project makes a clear distinction between gene variants that you can take action on (such as BRCA, where you can have enhanced screening or prophylactic surgery if you carry a high-risk variant) and those that you can’t. For instance, some variants of the ApoE gene strongly predispose the development of Alzheimer’s disease in later life, but knowing you carry this variant doesn’t enable you to prevent the condition.In the US, however, many more potentially life-changing results are reported. In 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics published a\u0026nbspminimum list of genes that it recommended should be communicated as secondary findings during clinical genome sequencing, which it has since updated to include 59 medically actionable genes.If you’re a parent seeking answers about your child’s rare condition, you may feel that the benefits of a diagnosis outweigh the downsides of finding out this additional information. Increasingly, genome sequencing is being offered to babies in neonatal intensive care units, meaning the age at which children are being diagnosed with rare diseases such as Pura syndrome is becoming lower. This may be helpful, as it cuts out those years of uncertainty and enables therapeutic action to be taken in some cases. Even in conditions such as Pura syndrome, where there is no therapy, the fact that there are other people from whom parents can learn about their child’s condition, and how to navigate some of problems it creates, is a huge comfort.“Even for genes we discovered just a few years ago like Pura, we’ve now got profiles of what the typical milestones look like for children,” says Firth. “We’ve got leaflets written with the help of the support groups that we can share with families.”Yet for Pura syndrome, there are many more questions that need answering. For one thing, why are the symptoms so variable between different iniduals? “We even have 12 patients now with the very same mutation in the very same position and they have very different symptoms,” Niessing says.For Alison Walker, the biggest question is what the future holds for her daughter. So far, only a handful of adults have been diagnosed with Pura syndrome, but it’s unclear whether this is because children with the condition don’t tend to survive to adulthood or because few adults have yet been tested for it.At the 2016 conference, Walker met a family whose daughter is younger than Evie, but up and walking, providing a glimpse of what Evie might be able to achieve with the right support.Mel Anderson and Alison Walker both hope that continuing to share information between families and increasing research into Pura syndrome will help find a treatment that will benefit their daughters. To date, some 250 people across the world have been identified with the condition, a disease that didn’t officially exist four years ago. With every new case, knowledge about it – and hope for the future – grows.This is an edited version of an article first published by Wellcome on Mosaic, and republished here under a Creative Commons licence.

At the same time, efforts are under way to eliminate tampon tax and taboos around menstruationFrom the time we’re old enough to get our periods, girls can be made to feel ashamed of them. Everyone who sat in a classroom through those strange, secretive years will remember the absolute horror and dread of being caught short or having to ask a teacher for menstrual products. We learn not only to come prepared but to be silent about what’s going on too. It’s second nature for us to conceal the very fact that we have periods at all – hiding tampons and pads on the way to the bathroom, stuffed into pencil cases, bras, sleeves.If it was difficult for those of us fortunate enough to always have these products to hand, it’s shocking to consider the girls among us who are forced by poverty to go without them entirely. Several years ago the concept of period poverty began to rise in public consciousness in the UK. The Ken Loach film I, Daniel Blake, a harrowing account of the realities of poverty in modern Britain, sent awareness of this particular struggle soaring. After its release, food bank managers around England reported that a scene in which a young woman named Katie is forced to shoplift pads sent toiletry donations skyrocketing.Of course, the problem isn’t confined to menstruation when an inidual or a family is living in poverty, it can mean they are forced to choose between eating enough or keeping the lights on and buying all sorts of hygiene essentials. A report by In Kind Direct – an organisation that receives donations from consumer goods companies and distributes them to charities – lists toothpaste, nappies, tampons, razors, deodorant and shampoo as items that had to be foregone by people living in poverty. It is vital that all of these essentials make their way to donation banks. But perhaps one reason that period poverty has especially caught public attention in the past two years is the particular problem of teenage girls, already at economic and social disadvantage, missing out on their education needlessly.Amika George, the teenage campaigner who started the #FreePeriods campaign, became engaged with the issue when she read an article about schoolgirls in Leeds who had been truant on the days of their periods. Concerned teachers had contacted Freedom4Girls, a charity established to provide sanitary products to Kenyan girls and women. Shocked that in modern Britain there were girls forced to choose between missing school and using unsafe alternatives such as socks, toilet paper and rags, George set to work.“I started a petition to call on the government to provide free menstrual products to girls from low-income families, and decided to spread the word and talk unashamedly, not just about period poverty but about menstruation!” she said in an interview with Vogue last year. More shocking to George, and many others, than the problem itself was the fact that nothing was being done about it by the government. Indeed, the fact that sanitary products are taxed as a luxury product means their prices are kept even higher than necessary, blocking more girls from accessing them.At the same time, girlguiding became much more menstruation-positive, with the introduction of a period poverty badge. Guides will be encouraged to discuss this as a social issue, support fundraising for donations, and explore how they feel personally about periods. An activity-led programme of education includes items such as role play of a scenario in which you’ve had a period leak while not at home. Doireann Larkin, the development manager of Tender, a charity that uses drama and the arts to help young people understand healthy relationships, fully supports the initiative: “We need to provide every opportunity for girls to feel confident and secure in school. By failing to address period poverty, we’re denying some girls the chance to focus and participate fully in class and increasing the disadvantage they might already be facing.”Guides will be able to get badges that are decorated with pictures of tampons, pads and menstrual cups, a fact that seems especially encouraging given how previous generations have been taught to hide such images. It’s a strange fact that, until recently, advertising for menstruation products would rarely show the actual product, using isolated fabric samples instead.The Homeless Period Project (HPP) addresses those already at their most vulnerable. While we may understand how desperate a homeless woman’s situation is, we rarely consider the logistical nightmare of menstruating without shelter and access to products. Local chapters of HPP set up their own fundraisers to donate to local shelters.These frontline activists and organisations are crucial. But so too is dismantling the taboo that exists behind all the secrecy and shame. We have to move on from the medieval idea that periods are dirty or not to be spoken of. That’s why young campaigners such as Grace F Victory are so important – she recently collaborated with the Always #EndPeriodPoverty campaign, which has seen the brand donate more than 5m pads directly to schools, a figure that’s estimated to rise to more than 10m donations by the end of the year. After her Instagram post of herself with a menstrual leak lost her hundreds of followers, she spoke out against them. Embarrassment is bad enough in and of itself, but when an inevitable bit of our biology causes us to miss out on daily life, there’s even more need to overcome it. We simply can’t accept that vulnerable young women are being blocked from their education.This is why ending period poverty needs to include taboo busting at its core. We can’t offer help to people too ashamed to ask for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c8843d3dbd779e5bd8cb5588e4e10c9784583cd/173_0_3162_1898/master/3162.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ef4da25eb525e28d175cced94f2b89b","title":"emmanuel macron theresa may brexit populism uk","story":"UK’s departure from EU cannot be ringfenced from what else is happening on continentFrance’s Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, last week told a group of French citizens at the French ambassador’s residence in Kensington that Brexit had become the British equivalent of the Dreyfus affair – the 19th-century scandal that ided families, parties and regions.On Thursday afternoon in Salzburg, Emmanuel Macron adopted the role of Emile Zola, accusing a conspiracy of liars of misleading the British people in the referendum, then running away and refusing to take responsibility.His remarks infuriated leavers, including some in the Labour party such as Caroline Flint, who said imperious insults from the French president were not going to warm the British public to the cause of remain. What plays well to the Berlaymont gallery does less well in Burnley.But that is to misunderstand the complexity of Macron’s motives. He is not just locked in a negotiation with the British to protect the single market, he is in a battle to defeat populism, of which Boris Johnson’s referendum campaign was a harbinger.His horizon does not just stretch to 29 March 2019, the current date of Brexit, but to 23 May, the date of the next European parliament elections. His target is not just the stubborn illusions of the British negotiators – he took care to praise May’s courage in his remarks – but the simplicities of Steve Bannon, Viktor Orbán, Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini.It is May’s misfortune that the two targets interconnect, making the task of a Brexit agreement favourable to Britain that much harder. Brexit cannot be ringfenced from what else is happening in Europe.The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, said: “In this fight, all progressive, democratic and pro-European forces have a duty to stand side-by-side on the same side of history,. We should not let Europe slide back into the past.”Guy Verhofstadt, the head of the Liberal group in the European parliament, who is courting an alliance with Macron’s En Marche, this month told the Ouest France newspaper: “Fortunately, we have Brexit. It illustrates the populist wave but it has also provoked a resurrection of attachment to the EU.”The Hungarians are equally clear about the battle ahead and have put Macron in their crosshairs. Péter Szijjártó, the combative Hungarian minister of foreign affairs, said: “Hungary is attacked by pro-immigration forces led by Macron ... Their goal is to change the composition of people living in Europe. We resist that ... Whatever the pressure, the Hungarian government will fight for the cause of Europe and the homeland.”It is hardly a surprise that the most vocal supporter of Brexit at Salzburg was Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister.The populists may be riding primarily on an anti-migrant wave, but in this all-stakes battle, Britain cannot be seen to be rewarded.If Macron could help engineer a further EU referendum in the UK he would welcome it, but above all, there can be no Brexit solution that provides comfort to governments that intend only to abide by the rules that suit their interests. A Europe that protects will be the dominant theme of the liberal progressive campaign for the May elections. Follow the populists and you end up in the chaos of Brexit.For the British remainers, now in more coordinated diplomatic contact with European capitals, the risk is their campaign will become collateral damage in a wider war.In their parallel diplomacy, remain has been urging European leaders to show their support for a vote on the final terms, primarily by saying they are open to extending the negotiating period if deadlock in the UK parliament provokes the genuine prospect of a British rethink. The call by Joseph Muscat, the Maltese prime minister and a confidante of Tony Blair, for a further referendum was on the right side of the line of interference.Equally, remain supporters are pressing the commission not to offer the EU a blindfold Brexit in its political declaration – a short statement on future trading relations that leaves much to be negotiated after Brexit. Loiseau, in her remarks to Chatham House last week, stressed French objections to this solution.The French are not playing the role of spoilers. They want a deal, but one that protects the integrity of the four freedoms of the single market. Anglo-French interests in the field of defence and security coincide too much for a breakdown. For instance, on the day Salzburg ended in acrimony, the French armed forces minister, Florence Parly, met her British counterpart, Gavin Williamson, to discuss the European Intervention Initiative, a plan for a flexible practical voluntary intervention force composed of nine European nations both inside and outside the EU.The French initiative has been created in part with Brexit in mind, ensuring cooperation between the two nations with the greatest military culture in Europe.In the weeks ahead, with so many forces already in play, there is a new element: the interplay between the interests of the pro-European leaders and supporters of remain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ef739b6774f195bdc7c95af7a56bebba7762c9/7_0_1167_700/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4df7227ce8218f8f51f310de83d6377b","title":"european press no more forgiving than british over salzburg summit theresa may","story":"If she was hoping for a small crumb of comfort after what the vast majority of the British media saw as a “humiliating” and “disastrous” Salzburg summit, Theresa May did not find it in the pages of the European press.Coverage of the meeting, at which May was bluntly informed that the core components of her Chequers plan “will not work”, was generally focused as much, if not more, on the EU’s disagreements over migration policy as it was on Brexit.But the conclusion of the continental media, few of which made events in Salzburg their top story, was that the prime minister’s predicament was wholly predictable – the EU’s view of Chequers has been known since it was published, many pointed out – and entirely her problem. Commentators were downright scathing.Sheila Sitalsing in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said May had “stormed the European continent like a Don Quixote”, Chequers plan and Brexit conditions under her arm: Britain wanted to “keep playing footie and snacking at the canteen, without paying any subs, wearing the club strip or doing bar duty”.The EU27 had “sent her packing in Salzburg”, Sitalsing said, where May had “desperately sought to win sympathy for a Brexit that would not send her population straight back to the Middle Ages”.Her threat that if she was replaced things might get worse “did not impress” EU leaders – but May still seems to believe their hard line “is just a negotiating tactic”. She has got it all wrong: “Poor Theresa May. Poor United Kingdom.”In the Spanish paper El Pais, Álvaro Imbernon Sainz said that since May took office in July 2016, her entire negotiating strategy had been “to postpone decision-making as much as possible, without putting together any kind of clear vision” – but the chickens were now coming home to roost.“The problem is that the differences between the two sides are not technical, but on fundamental principles, and time is beginning to run out,” he said. “Like a bad student who puts off the moment to sit down and study, it’s now up to the UK to make up for lost time.”Britain must “rediscover British pragmatism. For this, the Conservatives, and to a lesser extent Labour, must agree on a coherent and realistic position. Otherwise the historians of the future will be extremely hard on the current British political class”.In France, Le Figaro said May had been “caught in the trap of her ‘it’s me or chaos’” strategy. The prime minister’s Brexit plan was “dead and buried”, the paper said, after she “put her allies up against the wall” by insisting a no deal was the only alternative. “Unfortunately, her plan has met unanimous opposition.”For Le Monde, the EU27 had made plain that “the moment of truth” had come. The bloc’s leaders were “clearly singing from the same hymn sheet” and used the summit to sound the alarm, the paper said: “Brexit talks are in the closing straight – and the EU27 have, for the moment, no intention whatever of softening their stance.”The meeting was above all aimed at “putting maximum pressure on the British prime minister a few days ahead of her party’s annual conference”, it said, adding that the October final deadline set by Donald Tusk, the European council president, for progress on the Irish border was clearly significant.The paper quoted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying he had “perfectly summed up” the Europeans’ position on Brexit: Chequers “is not acceptable because it does not respect the integrity of the single market … Leaving the EU cannot be done without costs or consequences.”Tusk “flatly rejected Britain’s plan for future EU-UK trade relations”, wrote Germany’s Die Welt, adding that the EU27 had “categorically thrown out” May’s Chequers plan quite simply “because it fears it would lead to unfair competition from British firms”. Brexit talks, the paper said, “are deadlocked”.The Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung took the same line, quoting Tusk as saying “May’s Brexit plan will not work” and that negotiations were now at a standstill after “both sides camped firmly on their positions and no agreement was reached”.The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad said the EU 27 had “approached the British prime minister positively, but given little away”. Britain had “high hopes” of the summit, it said, but “the harvest was meagre”.The EU was walking a tightrope, the paper said: it had to be reasonably positive towards May while not budging, because: “British political drama is the greatest uncertainty around Brexit, and the horror scenario is that whatever is agreed with May proves worthless if she is replaced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7d29d97465ec6daefb29509f4a188df6e88ff8/0_30_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9927fd78636eac098bf68b764ff0206","title":"former tory mep leader criticises partys stance on supporting hungary","story":"Conservatives voted against EU sanctions process to protect democracy in HungaryA former Conservative MEP leader has condemned the party’s decision to vote with Viktor Orbán in opposing a European Union sanctions process to protect democracy in Hungary, amid growing criticism of the Tory party’s drift to the right.Edward McMillan-Scott was leader of Conservative MEPs between 1997 and 2001, but clashed with David Cameron over the decision to withdraw from the centre-right European People’s party in 2009. A former European parliament vice-president, he eventually became a Liberal Democrat and argues the Conservative party has moved away from its moderate tradition.“This is no longer the Conservative party that I belonged to for 25 years,” he told the . “I was leader of the Tory MEPs for four of those years and tried to fight the hard-right from within. But they are now dominant.”He said the party was “colluding” with nationalist governments in Poland and Hungary, a decision he traced back to Cameron’s decision to quit the EPP and launch a new Conservative group in the European parliament with controversial allies. “The Tory party, to its shame, has propitiated right from the outset what is the alt-right movement in Europe.”Conservative sources dismissed McMillan-Scott, who lost the party whip, but similar concerns have been made by Tory moderates.Julie Girling, an MEP who is suspended from the party over Brexit, said some “sensible people” voted against action on Hungary, because they followed the whips without questioning.The MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar, who now sits in the EPP, voted in favour of starting the sanctions procedure.“The whole hard right of the party has basically seized the agenda,” she said. “In order to be a member of the Brexit club you have to subscribe to all of this hardline rhetoric and to me personally it is not possible to do so … There is no room for discussion any more either you are with us, or you are our enemy.”The debate blew up earlier this month when Conservative MEPs voted with Orbán’s Fidesz party against triggering a disciplinary procedure aimed at protecting the rule of law in Hungary. Despite opposition, the vote was carried with a narrow majority, although it is unlikely Hungary will ever face the ultimate sanction, losing EU voting rights.The Tories have also come under fire for protecting Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party, the governing party, also their European parliament allies.Poland is subject to the EU’s disciplinary procedure, over sweeping changes to the court system that has given the government de-facto control of the judiciary.At a meeting of EU affairs ministers last Tuesday, France and Germany made a joint statement in protest at the judicial changes, saying Europe needed to stand up for “common values” ahead of European elections in May 2019. Represented by the Brexit minister and former MEP who helped create the Tory-PiS alliance, Lord Callanan, the UK was silent in the debate. “The internal affairs of Poland are a matter for them,” Callanan said.Conservative insiders are fed up with the deluge of criticism, insisting others have got it wrong, by handing Orbán an easy win that feeds his nationalist narrative. MEPs have overstepped their powers, the MEP Daniel Dalton has said. “Contrary to what our political opponents and some in the media are trying to portray, this in no way signalled approval or support for any of the policies of the Hungarian government.”“This is not a drift to the right,” said one Conservative source. “It is nothing to do with the direction of the Conservative party. It is solely to do with the best way to tackle Viktor Orbán.”Ashley Fox, the leader of Britain’s Conservative MEPs, frames the Polish and Hungarian questions as matters of national sovereignty. “How many warnings does the EU’s detached elite need about imposing its views and values on countries with varying cultures, histories and attitudes? Has nothing been learned from Brexit?”he wrote on Conservative Home earlier this year.But the argument has dismayed MEPs from other parties. “There is no way they would allow silencing of independent media in their own country and it surprises me and disappoints me that they are willing to overlook that in a country like Hungary,” said Judith Sargentini, the Dutch MEP who drafted the report calling for the EU to launch the disciplinary process. “It is simply about Brexit. It is simply about Theresa May needing all the support she can get.”Sophie in ‘t Veld, a vice-president of the Liberals in the European parliament, told the  in July that Conservative MEPs had trampled on their legacy. Speaking on Friday, she said the Conservative stance on Hungary and Poland was part of a wider pattern seen across European Christian Democrat parties and the US Republicans.The policy of non-interference may have boosted Theresa May’s support on Brexit from Poland and Hungary. But the two countries have minor influence among the EU 27, while EU membership underpins their economies.“The Polish government is so isolated,” in ‘t Veld said. “If the price would be to break up the internal market, then I think the Polish government is going to stick with the EU27 line.”At the EU summit in Salzburg, Orbán kissed May’s hand and said he was opposed to “punishing the British”, but did not speak up for the British prime minister during the EU27 Brexit debate.“He is many things,” in ‘t Veld said, “but he is not stupid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7b1c630b893a1f544ffd0daaa54ee4ddd4b9b4/0_77_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=044473389bc76ff0448bb7c26968136b","title":"theresa may demands respect from eu in brexit negotiations","story":"Prime minister gives combative speech after EU leaders’ rejection of Chequers planTheresa May has accused the European Union of not treating the UK with respect, in a hastily arranged Downing Street statement a day after she was humiliated at the Salzburg summit when EU leaders declared her Chequers plan would not work.A combative prime minister said she stood by Chequers and added that throughout the Brexit negotiations she had treated her counterparts with “nothing but respect” and added: “The UK expects the same.”May said the two sides remained “a long way apart” but insisted the UK was prepared to negotiate, and called on the EU to explain what it believed was wrong with her trade proposals, although significantly she did not mention Chequers by name.“It is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals,” May said. “So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them.”The prime minister also signalled that the UK would unilaterally safeguard the rights of the EU citizens living in the country in an attempt to reassure them that the impasse in negotiations would not affect their status.“There are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday’s summit means for their future. I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay,” May said.Ministers are expected to confirm details in a couple of weeks, after the party conference season.At the EU summit in Salzburg on Thursday May was ambushed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the EU council president, Donald Tusk, who embarrassed the prime minister by declaring that Chequers would not work.Downing Street is calculating that May can win support by appearing to stand up to the EU, although her critics in the party believe this would be the moment to give up the Chequers plan, which is an attempt to ensure that there is no return to a hard border in Ireland.Chequers proposes the UK shares a common rulebook for goods and services after Brexit in an attempt to prevent a return of customs checks for goods crossing the Irish border. But EU leaders believe it will undermine the single market by giving British companies a competitive advantage and pose a threat to the “European project”.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said that Salzburg was a “failure” and repeated that it was time to abandon Chequers and propose a Canada-style free trade deal. But he also accused the EU of not acting in good faith, and praised May for showing “steely resolve.” The prime minister repeatedly rejected an EU backstop proposal which would see Northern Ireland remain inside the customs union if the UK could not agree a free trade agreement with Brussels in the orce talks.Ratcheting up the language on the issue, May said: “Creating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would not respect that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, in line with the principle of consent, as set out clearly in the BelfastGood Friday agreement.“It is something I will never agree to – indeed, in my judgement it is something no British prime minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.”In her statement the prime minister had taken aim at the European council president, Donald Tusk. While some EU diplomats admitted to feeling uncomfortable at the bluntness of Tusk’s message, there was general support for the substance of his statement in which he had repeated Brussels’ negative assessment of the economic planks in the Chequers plan. An EU official said: “The EU’s position has been clear for a long time. The EU27 expressed their unity on this in Salzburg.”Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, criticised both the prime minister and the European Union in his statement: “Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.“From day one, the Prime Minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2013/8/8/1375945830573/Angela-Monaghan-003.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c33c74967b203c8b2a3810d13411f42f\" alt=\"Angela Monaghan","title":"theresa may makes statement outside no 10","story":"Prime minister says UK needs to hear from EU on what real alternatives areThe Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who has been an advocate for a soft Brexit, said she has spoken to May this afternoon and been reassured of her commitment to get a negotiated deal.Business leaders have reacted with some alarm to the comments by the prime minister on the distance between the two sides.CBI director Carolyn Fairbairn said negotiators on both sides must change tack. “Rejection of Chequers helps nobody,” she said. “Pragmatism must come before politics. Every day lost in rhetoric is lost investment and lost jobs.”Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also reproached both sides for the impasse. “While the Prime Minister’s determination to reach a deal is appreciated, businesses tell us over and over that the time for posturing from both sides is over,” he said. “Many firms are hugely worried about a messy and disorderly outcome, and the potential impact on their ability to trade and grow. Others could be caught flat-footed. Both sides must make every effort to avoid this scenario.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said the summit was a “failure” and that the EU was not acting in good faith. However, he praised the prime minister, saying she had showed “steely resolve.”He said it was time to admit the Chequers plan would not work for both the EU and the UK and start making plans for a Canada-style free trade deal. May made it clear in her speech that the EU has said it cannot countenance such a deal without Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union to prevent customs checks on the border.“It is time for the government to start putting forward as its plan a Canada-style free trade agreement for the whole of the UK. This is the most realistic approach and similar to the EU’s proposal,” he said. “Moreover, as every vote in parliament has so far shown, it is the one way which could command a majority in the House of Commons.“On the matter of the UK’s border with Ireland, the EU can have the solutions proposed by the ERG that respect the integrity of the Single Market and which have been supported by the DUP,” he said.“The Prime Minister has shown steely resolve at the eleventh hour and is standing up to the EU bullies. The next step is to say to the EU £40 billion and free trade or World Trade terms.”The pound is on course for its biggest one-day drop in 2018 against the dollar, after Theresa May said Brexit negotiations with the EU had reached an “impasse”.Traders took fright as May’s comments were taken as a sign that a no deal Brexit is an increasingly likely outcome of talks, creating uncertainty which unsettles traders.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that “no deal is not an option” and slammed the government’s negotiating tactics. However, his response does not include a demand that May drop her current plans and, interestingly, also calls on the EU to end the “political games.”Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.From day one, the Prime Minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option.EU sources were relaxed about May’s speech. They see it as as a “positioning” ahead of the Tory party conference after what they see as a self-inflicted wound in Salzburg.May’s demands that the EU come up with alternative proposals are seen as domestic politicking as the EU’s position in Brexit has been clear from the outset.While May’s failure to come with a proposal on the Irish border nine months after agreeing to one incensed EU leaders, it is said that it was Downing Street’s briefing to British journalists that some member states were being more sympathetic to the UK than others that prompted Macron to intervene. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP who back up May’s minority government, said there was “utter inflexibility and bullying tactics” from the EU. He said the EU was not negotiating in good faith or within the parameters of the Belfast agreement. “It seems to be their way or no way,” he told the BBC. He said there would be no regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that the DUP could accept.Dodds said the issue of Northern Ireland had been “abused” by remainers and EU leaders. “The border issue has been elevated to a far greater extent than it should,” he said. The Lib Dems are the first out of the traps to comment on the prime minister’s statement. The party’s Brexit spokesman Tom Brake says May should recall parliament, an idea unlikely to be popular with Labour who have their party conference next week.Two years down the line and the only consensus the PM has made across Parliament and the EU is that Chequers is unworkable,” he said. Instead of pontificating to television cameras, May must now recall Parliament to explain how she got the country into this terrible mess, what her plan is to get us out of it, and when we can have a people’s vote and an exit from Brexit.Here’s some more of the reaction:From the New Statesman’s Stephen BushFrom the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg:From the ’s Jennifer Rankin:From the WSJ’s Bojan Pancevski:Here are some of the key quotes from May’s statement in Downing Street. On the progress of the negotiations:I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight. While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that - despite the progress we have made - there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart. In plain English, this would mean we’d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn’t do the trade deals we want with other countries. That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago. On a Canada-style free trade deal and a customs border down the Irish Sea: It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.On the Irish backstop:The EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union. As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country. We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK. On red lines in the negotiations:As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other. We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs. We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens.On her treatment in SalzburgThroughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.On the referendum result: The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy. That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU. I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.On the prospect of no deal:No one wants a good deal more than me. But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations. We stand ready. The prime minister made clear she is bruised by her treatment in Salzburg. Her comments that she has treated the EU with respect and expects similar treatment were particularly pointed.Her guarantee to EU citizens that their rights will be protected is a officially new development, although one that has long been a tacit understanding.Nowhere in the speech did the prime minister mention the word “Chequers” - a sign the speech is intended for domestic consumption and much of it was explained in very plain language. It is also a sign that the word now has toxic connotations.However, there’s relatively little that has changed on substance. May defended her plan for a common rulebook on goods and a facilitated customs arrangement as the only path to respecting the referendum result and avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. Those were the two issues that she said there was still considerable distance between the two parties.Neither of the two options on the table from the EU could ever be acceptable, she said. A Norway-style arrangement where the UK remained in the single market would not respect the referendum result, she said, because it would mean continued free movement and leave the UK as a “rule taker.” May said a Canada-style FTA, the other option on offer, would only be offered if Northern Ireland remained in the customs union and parts of the single market, something that risked a border down the Irish sea and the break up of the UK.She ended with a good faith offer both to people in Northern Ireland and EU citizens, saying she would protect their rights. But she issued a veiled warning to EU leaders that there was no prospect of the UK reversing its decision, or calling another referendum. May says she wants to clarify several issues. She says she wants to be clear that the rights of EU citizens will be protected in the event of no deal. She says to the people of Northern Ireland that they will do everything to prevent a hard border with the Irish republic.She also says the EU referendum was the biggest democratic exercise in the country’s history and said for over two years she has worked “day and night” and worked to “bring people with me.”The EU should be clear, I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement in resolving the two big problems in the negotiations and we stand ready.May says that both options would be “a bad deal... I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal.”She says she has treated the EU “with nothing but respect” and says that she expects the same.“We now need to hear from the EU what the real alternative is and we can discuss them.”May says one option is the EEA - which means abiding by all EU rules, “uncontrolled immigration from the EU” and no trade deal with other countries. She says it would “make a mockery” of the EU referendum result.She says the second option was a basic free trade agreement for Britain and Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union, permanently separated from the rest of the UK.She says a customs border would not respect that Northern Ireland is “an integral part of the United Kingdom... it something I will never agree to.”The prime minister is speaking now in Downing Street. She says both sides want a deal but there are two areas where the UK and the EU are “a long way apart.”She says the EU is still only offering two options on the future economic relationship. The BBC is reporting that May will restate that she is committed to the Chequers plan for the Brexit negotiations. She is likely to make an appeal to EU leaders to engage on the details. Here’s the BBC’s story.Plus the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg has an update on the power situation in Number 10 (I can’t quite believe I’m typing that).The statement is supposed to be at 13.45 - but Sky News’ political news editor reveals there are a few technical problems. Earlier the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab suggested the UK would hold firm on the Chequers proposal.He said it was now for the EU to engage seriously, accusing leaders of putting “the handbrake” on negotiations. We’ve been rebuffed on our plans without any coherent explanation as to why, there’s these sort of rather dogmatic pleas to the single market unity but our plans were very carefully crafted around that.” We’re going to hold our nerve, stay calm and keep negotiating in good faith. We’ve revved up the motor of these negotiations, I’ve been out there a lot more frequently to get motoring, to make progress and the EU have just yanked up the handbrake and for the negotiations to go forward they’re going to have to take their hand off the handbrake.Raab also criticised Tusk for his social media post, saying it “didn’t feel like very statesman-like behaviour.” There’s a big question mark about whether the EU is really serious about the substance of these negotiations.Downing Street has insisted the statement will be an update on the negotiations. It is highly unlikely that May is announcing her departure or announcing a general election, Number 10 sources have already categorically denied this.The real interest will be whether the prime minister uses the statement to double-down on her Chequers plan or hint that there is longer a no path for the offer, which involves a free trade area for goods, governed by a common UK-EU rulebook. The former is far more likely than the latter. We’re also likely to see some red meat thrown to the hard-line Brexiters who will want to see the prime minister hit back at some of the humiliating language used by EU leaders in Salzburg, including being openly mocked by Donald Tusk on his Instagram.Many of her MPs, and some of her cabinet, would prefer to see her dump Chequers and seek a Canada-style free trade agreement, but the problems that would cause for the future of the Northern Irish border seem near insurmountable.Theresa May will give an unplanned update on the state of the ongoing Brexit negotiations in the wake of the unexpectedly sharp rejection of her Chequers plans by EU leaders in Salzburg.We’re expecting it to be a statement to cameras at 10 Downing Street. Inevitably, the Westminster rumour mill is swirling but at the moment all indications are that she will say the government intends to press ahead with its current offer and continue negotiations.European Council President Donald Tusk said her proposal for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods risked the integrity of the EU single market and French president Emmanuel Macron also attacked the proposal. Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel have also said significantly more progress is needed by the European Council summit on October 18 if agreement on the UK’s withdrawal deal is to be reached.

Joshua is smart. He knows that. And given he has a four-inch height and seven-inch reach advantage over Alexander Povetkin I expect him to start on the outside, dominating with his jab and gradually wearing the his opponent down, much like Wladimir Klitschko did during his wide points victory over the Russian in 2013.I wasn’t impressed with Povetkin’s last performance against David Price, even though he finished it with a peach of a knockout, because the Russian was in serious trouble at the end of the third. Price is a big puncher but he’s not the fastest – whereas Joshua is more explosive and can bang even harder. I would give it two or three rounds to see what Povetkin has got and then start throwing a couple of power shots behind the jab to test his chin. And as soon as you get him going – finish him.I struggle to see how Povetkin can win this. I’m not doubting his pedigree – like Joshua he is an Olympic super heavyweight champion – and puts his shots together nicely. Having been brought up in the Russian system he is also correct in what he does, although that makes him easier to read. His best hope is to weather the early storm by keeping his defence tight, and as Joshua fades get in close with his big hooks and uppercuts. It’s not an impossible scenario but I can’t see it happening.Joshua’s last performance against Joseph Parker was criticised because there was no knockout, but I saw it differently. Don’t forget Parker was unbeaten and had never been put down – yet Joshua’s trainer Robert McCracken devised a gameplan that gave his man an easy night. Meanwhile Dillian Whyte only just clung on to beat Parker. There will be pressure on Joshua to get the knockout with 80,000 in Wembley baying for blood. But there is no need to take risks. The knockout will come.Some people think Joshua has stamina issues – he looked desperately tired against Klitschko and Carlos Takam. But a good young one will always beat a good older one and at 39, time is not on Povetkin’s side. He has also shown chinks in his armour, especially against Price. While the Russian will be competitive for three rounds, I expect him to be gassing by rounds five or six. Which is when I expect Joshua to get him out of there.Dominic Ingle is the trainer of WBO world middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98be0752473136d9448546276faf3077d313750d/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8d3cac69399cd5e56ce80c5067297b8","title":"thomas bjorn europe captain ryder cup interview","story":"Europe’s captain, Thomas Bjørn, believes the Ryder Cup is about bringing the people of the continent together, regardless of the political backgroundFrom Friday on the outskirts of Paris a golf team united by the flag of Europe, led by a Dane, will take on the might of the United States. When it arrives, the Ryder Cup is the most significant sporting event in the world. This time, as Brexit looms and questions regarding what a European identity actually means cast a shadow over society, the broader picture is impossible to ignore.Thomas Bjørn, Europe’s captain, will not go down the predictable route of refusing to link sport and politics. On the contrary Bjørn seems of a mind to make Europe, the existing if fractured concept, a cornerstone of his work.“I think sometimes what is forgotten, in the political discussion, is how great this continent is,” Bjørn says. “From all the way down in Greece, to Iceland, there are so many great countries and so much natural common ground. It is such a small continent compared to the others but together we have so much history and so many great things going for us. I think that is forgotten a little bit in the political picture.“It means a lot more to us as golfers because we grow up with the European Tour. The backbone of that tour is still our European events. It is part of the life we live. It has a meaning.“I think a lot of people in their everyday life have a hard time relating to what Europe is. Something that gets a little bit into people’s minds, in my opinion, is ‘What is Europe?’ and ‘What is the European Union?’ So you have Norway and Switzerland and soon to be the UK as part of Europe but not the EU. For some people that leads to ‘Who is what?’ and ‘What is what?’“The identity of Europe in the Ryder Cup comes from the team how they see themselves, through different countries, as Europe coming together. That, for me, is a thing the Ryder Cup does so well. It brings us together. You adapt an approach towards Europe, which you know is an essential part of what you do. When you get in that team room you are in it for yourself, your country and your continent.”Bjørn speaks from a position of authority. He is the embodiment of the European Tour, a domain he has featured in more than 500 times as a player. When growing up in Silkeborg, a small town on Denmark’s east coast, he had to battle a mother who was adamant young Thomas would not be a golf professional. “She didn’t think that was a way to make a living. She was clearly against it.”Bjørn duly removed himself from a rocky relationship with his country’s golf federation to turn professional on his own terms. “If I was going to continue to play golf, I wasn’t going to continue in that environment,” he adds. “The sacrifice as a teenager was enormous, to let people dictate how my life was going to look as an amateur golfer.”Bjørn applied the logic of “bleeding hands and hard work.” Now, he is the first Scandinavian to captain Europe. “There was a feeling that Denmark had its place in the golfing world, which wasn’t anywhere,” recalls Bjørn. “That didn’t motivate me, what did was me driving to be as I could be. I hear youngsters now say they want to be Tiger Woods or Rory McIlroy. No you want to be you. Tiger and Rory don’t try to be somebody else.”Bjørn is hugely respected but admits his own nature – complex, with traces of obsession – has rendered elements of captaincy tricky. He has refused not only to consider the likelihood of defeat or victory but what life involves after the show is over.“I wouldn’t like to be the hero if we win,” says Bjørn. “I wouldn’t like to be the villain if we lose. Nobody likes being the villain.“As a golfer, I would tell my caddie or my coach ‘This is what I want, this is what we are doing.’ It doesn’t work like that in this role because there are so many little pieces that impact every decision and it has to work for everyone.“I think about the 12 players, dealing with situations that could arise and how I see the week progressing. Through that process, hopefully they play the golf to deliver a result. I trust them with everything I have because I think this is a wonderful team and a wonderful group of guys.“I have committed myself to this time. On the 1st of October, I don’t know what is going to happen in my life, I honestly don’t. I have made no decisions about continuing to play golf, about whether I will do something completely different, about whether I will stay in the game.“Those players deserve my full attention. It will be a very empty feeling afterwards because for 20 months, this has been everything to me, on my mind constantly. Hopefully a picture will form itself afterwards.”There is a sombre element attached to Bjørn’s role. In 2006 Bjørn launched a stinging attack on Europe’s “most pathetic captain” Ian Woosnam after objecting to the circumstances by which he found out about failure to earn a wildcard pick for the K Club. An apology was instantly made but damage had been done. Scar tissue lingers, as made clear by Bjørn’s emotion when discussing the scenario.“It is a shame because Woosie did so much for me early in my career and it all turned out very wrong,” Bjørn says. “He meant so much to me.“It was blown out of proportion. Certain things were said that weren’t right, certain things were done that weren’t right. I have tried for 12 years now to put a lid on it but sometimes when something like that happens, you can’t really put it back in its box.“The sad thing for me is that I don’t have a relationship with a man that meant so much to me. I played my first Ryder Cup match with him. I sit here as Ryder Cup captain and, if everything had turned out the right way, he would probably be a big part of my life … I would be having conversations with him about what was going to happen in Paris.” Instead Bjørn and Woosnam have been reduced to small talk at the past two Masters.Bjørn has already had to withstand something of a storm. When selecting the experienced Ian Poulter, Henrik Stenson, Sergio García and Paul Casey as European wildcards, the allegation was of an old pals’ act.“I think you’d have found if it was old pals there would be one or two others playing,” Bjørn insists. “Some of the guys left out are very close to me and I was never scared of making tough decisions. Now, if people think I made these decisions on the back of them being pals then they don’t know me very well and that’s OK. That mostly comes from people who have no idea who I am, what I think and what I believe in.“It disappoints me if people, who I think know me, would think like this. People who don’t know me and have no concept of who I am? That’s fine. You actually couldn’t come up with a thing that is more not me.”If Bjørn is central to this Ryder Cup, there is no doubt about its most high profile figure. Tiger Woods, who has rescued his career from the depths of despair, will don US colours once more. “The game of golf is where it is today primarily because of what he did for the game in the late 90s and early 2000s,” says Europe’s captain. “He changed the face of the game and brought it to the masses. As a golf fan, which I am, you cannot be anything other than excited about Tiger back in the Ryder Cup team.”Bjørn played in his third Ryder Cup in 2014 when the captain, Paul McGinley, turned to Sir Alex Ferguson to inspire participants with a rousing pep-talk. Bjørn’s Liverpool leanings did not prevent him from being inspired but there will be no appearance of Jürgen Klopp at Le Golf National.“With Alex the timing was unbelievable so many things fitted in perfectly,” Bjørn says. “That was Paul’s brainchild and his way of doing things. You have to be careful, I don’t want to imitate Paul McGinley. Paul would be the first person to say that to me. Jürgen Klopp would be for me, I don’t think that would be for the team.”Or for Europe. Over three days in France, Bjørn will be adamant it is all for Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908265e5979c1f038be88d1b9c7ea704c85cc478/0_108_4887_2933/master/4887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602e8e93410dbf13741f54248e3fc21b","title":"wada head russia reinstatement triumph money over clean sport","story":"• David Howman accuses Wada of bowing to pressure• Russia now only must admit ‘certain iniduals’ were to blameThe World Anti-Doping Agency’s decision to reinstate the Russian Anti-Doping Agency is a triumph for money over clean sport, according to the agency’s former director general.David Howman, who ran Wada from 2003 to 2016 and is now the head of the Athletics Integrity Unit, strongly criticised the president, Sir Craig Reedie, for caving in to pressure from the International Olympic Committee and sports federations eager to stage events in Russia again.“I am a little disappointed, to say the least,” Howman said. “This looks like they have taken the decision to deviate from a carefully put-together roadmap for entirely pragmatic reasons. Wada has gone from being an organisation that cared about clean athletes to one that cares about international federations that have not been able to stage events in Russia: it’s money over principle. That is a quite a difference, quite a swing, from what Wada once was.”Rusada was suspended in November 2015 when its central role in the Russian doping scandal was first confirmed by an investigation led by the former Wada president Dick Pound.The Canadian legal expert professor Richard McLaren conducted a second, much wider investigation in 2016, and its findings shocked athletes and sports fans around the world, forcing the IOC to block its member federations from staging events in Russia until it had a compliant national anti-doping agency again. One consequence of Rusada’s reinstatement is that Wada does not have to declare international boxing federation AIBA non-compliant for giving its 2019 world championships to Sochi.The IOC has been pushing Wada hard to make such headaches go away and all six of its representatives on the 12-strong ExCo voted for the compromise deal on Thursday, with the IOC member Reedie also backing it. In fact, the deal, which was only finalised between Reedie and the Russian sports minister, Pavel Kolobkov, last week, sailed through by nine votes to two, a result that provoked a furious response from athletes groups and national anti-doping agencies.Instead of Russia having to acknowledge its doping was state-sponsored and grant unconditional access to the Moscow laboratory’s data and stored samples before reinstatement (in line with the mutually-agreed “roadmap to compliance” Howman referred to), it now only has to admit that “certain iniduals” were to blame, and the lab access comes with conditions and a new timetable. Like many in the anti-doping community, Howman is at a loss to understand why Wada has agreed to this.On the issue of the IOC’s influence, the former IOC executive committee member said Wada had always “managed to walk the fine line” between the desires of its two sponsors, national governments and sport, “until Russia came along, because it was too big, too rich, too powerful”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be41e6404cc3b075a1d1fd9b47259f8d9ef17a92/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8ae0ffcdc7795ff6d24fbe205d95a6a","title":"county cricket updates yorkshire hampshire and more","story":"• Follow the (weather-affected) action from around the grounds• How Surrey created the greatest cricket production line• Leave comments below the line or tweet @tykestravelsIt seems the only thing left in that Sussex v Warwickshire game is to see whether Sam Hain can complete his century.

Opener Billy Godleman is holding things together with an unbeaten 93, while Anuj Dal has just arrived at the crease. Warwickshire are still batting at Hove … 334 for 2 with a lead of 431. Dom Sibley has 128 and Sam Hain 68. A closer look at Somerset’s pitch …Derbyshire are 119 for 4 against Middlesex, having lost Alex Hughes and Harvey Hosein in the last hour. Hughes was ousted by Martin Andersson, the seamer who was on loan at Derbyshire a fortnight ago before being recalled. The visitors require 209 more for victory.Warwickshire are still batting, making absolutely certain of promotion rather than going all out for victory against Sussex at Hove. They are 289 for 2, leading by 390. Dom Sibley is unbeaten on 113 and Sam Hain 50. While I was getting some quotes following this Yorkshire v Hampshire draw, they have abandoned the game in a draw at Bristol, where they was only five overs possible on day four between Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire before more rain.So just two matches are in play now, both in Division Two. Warwickshire lead Sussex by 346 at lunch at Hove. They are 249 for 2 in their second innings. At Lord’s, Derbyshire are 108 for 3 chasing 328 to beat Middlesex.Some reaction from Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale as his side close in on Division One safety. He said: “I thought it was a good solid week. We spoke before the game about how we’re probably playing our best cricket of the season towards the back end, and we’ve got some confidence back. We had a good solid draw at Trent Bridge and then beat Lancashire in a close battle.Play has been abandoned here at Headingley, so a draw. Eight points for Yorkshire leaves them needing a maximum of two points from next week’s clash with Worcestershire at New Road to secure safety.Ian Bell has been forced to retire hurt at Hove after being hit on the thumb by a rising delivery from Oliver Robinson. He has gone for an x-ray. Warwickshire 191 for 2, leading by 288. They are due to start at Bristol any time now.Wickets at Hove and Lord’s. Warwickshire are 168 for 1 in their second innings against Sussex, leading by 265. Will Rhodes has just been trapped lbw by former Yorkshire teammate Oliver Robinson for 88. At Lord’s, Derbyshire are 33 for 1 in their chase against Middlesex. Tim Murtagh has removed Luis Reece this morning.A little more on events at Taunton, where high winds blew the covers off the pitch at the River End of the ground overnight, with a tyre mark even left on the pitch, as you can see here … The mopping up process had started at Headingley, but it has started raining again. They have started at Hove and Lord’s, the latter where Derbyshire are 15 for 0 chasing 328 against Middlesex. There will be an inspection at 11am at Bristol ahead of day four between Gloucestershire and Northants. This just in from the Press Association:Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart expressed his frustration at his side’s hopes of a 10th successive victory being wiped out by elements beyond their control.While he was quick to absolve Somerset of any underhand tactics, Stewart has suggested the England and Wales Cricket Board look into the matter to prevent a repeat.He said in a video posted on Surrey’s Twitter account: “I’m sure Somerset haven’t done this on purpose in any shape or form but we were trying to win a game, were trying to win 10 on the bounce and it’s been taken out of our hands in a game where we were well ahead.“These things don’t happen too often but imagine if this game had potentially been a championship decider, which at one stage it was looking to be a few games ago. Just say Somerset were ahead and then we were here and this had happened, a lot more would have been said.“It’s probably worth the ECB looking ahead, should this sort of thing happen again, what would happen. Is it just an abandoned game? Is it the home side’s responsibility to ensure the covering and everything is of the right standard?“You can tell we are very, very frustrated and disappointed, as are Somerset, because they wanted to try to save the game and well done to them for trying to do that. It’s just a real frustration all round.” Drama at Taunton, where the covers have blown off in an overnight storm, leaving conditions unplayable. So that match finishes in a draw, leaving champions Surrey with 13 points and Somerset five. Somerset were 168 for 3 in their second innings overnight, a deficit of 171. That means Surrey’s nine-game winning streak comes to an end.Here at Headingley, it is not quite as dramatic a scene, but I suspect the game will go the same way. Heavy rain overnight, and there has been no attempt yet made to start the mopping up process. Umpires Graham Lloyd and Michael Gough have called an early lunch at 12pm. They will call it off shortly afterwards. Yorkshire are 287-5 in their second innings, leading by 314. Eight points for the draw will leave them needing a maximum of two points from next week’s final round clash with Worcestershire at New Road to secure Division One safety. Hampshire are already safe. In Division Two, there are three games still in play. At Hove, Warwickshire (141 for 0 in their second innings) lead Sussex by 238 and are chasing a win which would take them back above Kent to the top of Division Two. A draw, which would be enough to secure promotion, would leave it level pegging ahead of next week’s clash between the two sides at Edgbaston – a title decider. At Lord’s, Middlesex will begin day four on 199 for 7 in their second innings, leading Derbyshire by 327, while Northamptonshire have a first-innings lead of 48 over Gloucestershire at Bristol. There was no play possible there yesterday. The sun is shining at all three venues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc7a264e0ee12883babcdb5365e139a96176962d/0_198_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26034236a08100ad8ce849a5f84b3d73","title":"michael palin in north korea review","story":"In the first of a three-part series, the avuncular ex-Python’s tightly controlled visit captures the strangeness of the country – but not how sinister it isThe immediate question that presents itself with a programme called Michael Palin in North Korea is – do we really need Michael Palin in North Korea? It already has an actual Ministry of Silly Walks – and you can get quite severely punished if you don’t fall into step. It was a question that hung over the whole of the opening episode, filmed with permission and under the close supervision of the despotic regime of the so-called Democratic People’s Republic. Palin and the crew were attended at all times by two personable guides (one of whom explained that her party badge symbolised all that the North Koreans “learn from our hearts that our leaders have done great things for our country – we call it singlehearted unity”) and shadowed by a less personable entourage a few degrees further out, who weren’t featured on camera.The whole thing was an exercise in so-far-and-no-further. “Can there be a country more shrouded in mystery and fear?” asked Palin in voiceover at the beginning of the episode. To which the answer can only be – no, but not on the evidence of the rest of the hour.The physical difference between China and North Korea as Palin crossed the Yalu river was obvious. Seventy years of isolation have left the latter bleak and barren, while its neighbour’s gleaming buildings scrape the sky and stand as shining monuments to social and economic progress. North Korea has low-rise concrete blocks and no cars and the only shining monuments are the two huge statues of the country’s first two supreme leaders, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-il, at Mansu Hill. They smile benevolently over Pyongyang.Palin, though unsettled by the lack of internet, absence of phone signal and the fact that the border officials have possession of all his and his companions’ passports, marvelled at the extravagant underground train stations and the extraordinarily robotic, choreographed movements of the traffic police – all young women “rumoured to be handpicked by Kim Jong-un himself” – got a head massage at a state-run health complex (synchronised swimming in the pool, a very narrow range of approved haircuts available in the salon) and was shown the centre where table tennis players practise, bent on fulfilling the third supreme leader’s current wish that his country becomes the standard bearer for the sport.Palin also visited a secondary school. He threw an inflatable globe around and the children dutifully named countries, while their teacher stood in the background looking increasingly worried. He asked them what they wanted to be when they grew up. Doctors, teachers and loyal members of the army “respectful of Kim Jong-un”. One girl wanted to be a writer. She stood up and recited a self-penned poem glorifying Mount Paektu, the birthplace – North Koreans are taught – of Kim Jong-il.Palin professed himself eager to engage with the “real” country and its people, but of course – if by real, we mean the kernels of souls and psyches presumed to have survived intact the generations of propaganda, brainwashing, constant threat of punishment and corrosive fear – this is impossible. The closest he came was to note, slightly patronisingly – rare is the travelogue that sidesteps that trap entirely – that the “joy and humanity” during the International Workers’ Day, when the parks are flooded with three million people drinking, dancing and drinking some more, “is undimmed”. And yet still, when a drunken man danced with him slightly too long, his wife quickly pulled him away.The overall tone of the hour remained, because Palin the presenter has become no less amiable or avuncular with age, soothingly gentle. The strangeness of North Korea came through, but not the sinisterness. Except perhaps when Palin stood on his balcony and listened to the haunting Blade Runner-like music that emanates from unspecifiable sources and permeates the city every morning, calling its citizens to work. The greatest piece of knowledge vouchsafed us by this opening episode was definitely that if you want to infuse your regime with a sense of inescapable yet ineffable threat, use a theremin. There were a few nods to the fact that he is there at “a unique time in the country’s history”, as Trump’s gravitational field pulls on everything and the papers fill with news of unprecedented meetings between the heads of North and South Korea, but it stayed a travelogue rather than an investigation into anything more. There were hints that it would dig slightly deeper in the trailer for next week’s episode, when Palin heads out into the less prosperous countryside and visits military bases, but you almost fear the damage his amiability could do. In North Korea, you don’t want to see someone opening up while, just off camera, the state’s spies watch.

Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.“I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents,” Trump said. “I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!Trump said he believes Kavanaugh is “under assault by radical leftwing politicians”. In the tweets on Friday, he said that Kavanaugh has an “impeccable reputation” and that Democrats “don’t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay”.A Senate panel vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation was delayed after Ford’s allegations came out last week.Ford told a Senate committee she would be willing to testify later next week as a Friday morning deadline set by the Republican-led Senate judiciary committee loomed. The panel had scheduled a hearing on Monday.Ford is asking for the hearing on Capitol Hill in which she will testify against Kavanaugh be moved to next Thursday.Ford had already indicated that she cannot be prepared by Monday, as the current schedule for a hearing in front of the Senate judiciary committee demands.The California professor is willing to come to Washington to give her account and be questioned by senators, but doesn’t want Kavanaugh in the same room, her attorney told judiciary committee staff in a 30-minute phone call later on Thursday. The conversation also touched on security concerns and others issues, according to a Senate aide who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because public discussion of the matter was unauthorized.Ford is willing to give her account to the judiciary committee, whose senators need to vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation before it goes to a full Senate vote.But she will only appear if agreement can be reached on “terms that are fair and which ensure her safety”, the attorney, Debra Katz, said in an email to the committee revealed earlier on Thursday. In the later call, the lawyer said Ford needed more time to secure her family, prepare her testimony and travel to the capital. No decisions were reached, the aide said.On Thursday night, Donald Trump, who had been uncharacteristically restrained in his comments on the crisis, challenged Ford’s story, during an interview with Fox News while at a rally in Las Vegas.“I think it’s a very sad situation,” said Trump, asking: “Why didn’t somebody call the FBI 36 years ago? … What’s going on?”While he said Ford should “have her say”, he made clear he was done waiting: “I don’t think you can delay it any longer. They’ve delayed it a week already.” Kavanaugh, 53, currently a judge on the powerful US court of appeals for the DC circuit, has repeatedly denied her allegation. The accusation has jarred the 53-year-old conservative jurist’s prospects for winning confirmation which, until Ford’s emergence last week, had seemed all but certain.Supporters of both Kavanaugh and Ford have been lining up to vouch for their side. It also emerged this week that a prominent Yale law professor told students it was “not an accident” that Kavanaugh’s female law clerks all “looked like models” and would provide advice to them about their physical appearance if they wanted to work for him.There was no word from Capitol Hill early on Friday morning about whether the committee will move the hearing.Republicans are anxious to move ahead to a vote by the committee, where they hold an 11-10 majority, and then by the full Senate, which they control, 51-49.Taylor Foy, the spokesman for Republicans on the panel, said after the Thursday phone call that Grassley “will consult with his colleagues on the committee. He remains committed to providing a fair forum for both Dr Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.”Katz emphasized that Ford, 51, a psychology professor in northern California, has received death threats and for safety reasons has relocated her family.“She wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety,” Katz wrote in the email, which was obtained by the  and the Associated Press after first being reported by the New York Times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8b751bc95cfd9ab9d699a11a0defc98a0044637/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ef4a5eebcbf265f03db77dbba69bd5","title":"what masculinity means when youre gay bi or trans ","story":"We’re in the middle of a ‘genderquake’ where the qualities traditionally associated with men are changing daily. So how do three LGBT guys define manliness in 2018?Here, three men – one gay, one bisexual and one trans – reveal what modern masculinity means to them.Throughout my school years I felt that I couldn’t do anything right. I was always a very dainty child, and growing up on a council estate I felt like an alien who’d been dropped down from outer space. I had a girlie voice and feminine mannerisms, and everything I did was jumped on.When I went to university, I started to get good-looking girlfriends, and people left me alone, but I was still repressing myself. Being with women didn’t feel quite right I just didn’t want to be gay.Eventually, at 24, I came out and life began. But even though I’d started to care less about conforming, I still battled with a lot of internalised homophobia. In the gay community, masculine men are seen as more attractive, so again I ended up compromising myself.I still have days where I’m conscious of my behaviour being “too” effeminate, especially when I’m in a professional capacity or meeting someone for the first time, but I’ve become more accepting of myself with time. Sometimes I feel sorry for straight men who can cry at a football match but would feel embarrassed and unmanly telling their partner they love them – I think that’s really sad.In a way it’s quite freeing that it’s generally OK for a gay man to be seen as emotional, and that it isn’t seen as a sign of weakness. I think straight people can benefit from having an LGBT friend, because we have a different perspective, informed by our experiences. In a way, I’m glad that I haven’t necessarily had the easiest ride, because it’s made me a more rounded person.When I was single and using dating apps, I found that things would be going well until I mentioned that I dated both men and women – then women would stop replying or suddenly realise that they weren’t over their ex.My girlfriend gets strange comments, like, “Are you the one dating a gay guy?”, and my masculinity has definitely felt under attack at times. I’ve found myself wondering whether I’m manly enough – I think those are feelings that a lot of men struggle with, whether gay, straight or bi.We’re all supposed to aspire to being super macho, but I hope we’re starting to realise that there’s more than one way of being a man. In fact, my girlfriend would say that dating a bisexual man is better, because I have a more flexible mindset. I don’t assume that she’ll do the washing up because she’s a woman, or that I’ll do the DIY because I’m a man. She tells me I’m one of the manliest people she knows, not because I have the deepest voice or the broadest shoulders, but because I know who I am, and I never feel the need to pretend to be anyone else.For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt male. Even when I was four years old, my mum remembers me crying and telling her I felt like a boy trapped in a girl’s body. Then, when I was eight, I played on a boys’ basketball team and nobody thought to question it.It was only when I started high school that things got weird. I tried to fit in because I didn’t want to get teased, but I’d overhear people asking, “Is that a boy in a skirt?” My mum would help with my makeup and take me shopping, but it felt like I was doing drag. Coming from a small town, I didn’t even know what it meant to be trans all I knew was how I felt.Then, once I started to transition, I made a lot of effort to be ultra masculine, spending lots of time in the gym so that I’d “pass” as a man. These days, I’m much more comfortable with myself and I’m not afraid of my feminine side, because I know it doesn’t stop me being male.People sometimes think I’m gay, because I can be a bit camp, and I’m OK with that. I do comedy videos online, and, funnily enough, most of the characters I’m known for are women. Some people don’t realise I’m trans and post comments saying, “If you like being women so much why don’t you just become one?” I think: “Been there, done that!”Photography: Dan Wilton for Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s being true to yourself or a finding grooming routine that works for you.

But are we losing the ability to do good for its own sake? It is a shrewd psychological tactic that all parents will be familiar with: instead of berating an errant child for their wrongdoings, focus instead in rewarding them for good behaviour.Now the idea is catching on outside the nursery, with implications for everything from recycling clothes to policing. Put simply: to get people to do things, throw away those sticks and invest in a prodigious quantity of carrots.Take the modern phenomenon of “fast fashion”: determined to keep prices artificially low for consumers, clothes companies exploit workers and use shoddy materials. The scale and pace of production and distribution is disastrous for the environment, and consumers end up with piles of unwanted clothes. Every year in the UK, 300,000 tonnes ends up in landfill – 235 million inidual items.Now however, apps such as ReGain, Regive and Stuffstr are making it simpler – and more worthwhile - for people to return their unwanted clobber.The ReGain app can be used to find one of 20,000 drop-off points. In return, the diligent consumer earns rewards such as discount coupons for high street retailers. Stuffstr works in partnership with John Lewis to help people get cash in return for unwanted items from the chain.“Possibly the one prediction that we economists get right is that if you incentivise a behaviour, you will get more of it,” says Dr Matthew Levy, a lecturer in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE).He cites research, including his own, showing that financial incentives encouraging regular exercise, stopping smoking and losing weight effectively promote healthy behaviours and that there is no backlash when the incentives are removed. “If anything, the incentives can be used to jump-start a healthy habit that keeps going,” he says.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“We need to find a way to influence behaviour, and discount coupons help,” he says. The platform is also working with brands and retailers to find ways to ert used clothes from landfills and into the production of new clothes, he adds.Other reward schemes have had success in encouraging behavioural change.“The ticket is the gateway to the relationship,” says Ward Clapham, the former superintendent of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Richmond, British Columbia. “If you want to build up an environment of trust, cooperation, collaboration and support, you have to have a relationship and its a lot easier to start that in a positive environment than in a negative one.“My officers would say ‘In the old days we’d drive up in the police car and the kids would run away from us, now they run to us’.”Similar ticketing schemes have been trialled in the UK, and rolled out in Australia, Brazil, India, Japan, the US, and elsewhere, as police forces look at new ways to build trust within communities.In a similar venture, Hull city council have announced plans to launch a digital reward token – the HullCoin – that can be earned by volunteering and spent at local retailers.Elsewhere, a study on the recruitment of health workers in Zambia found that highlighting economic incentives during the recruitment process caused future employees to be more motivated and task-focused.“Emphasising the economic incentives led to the recruitment of more effective, and more devoted, health workers than emphasising the societal benefits,” Levy explains.Conversely, if the deterrent for a particular action is not substantial enough (ie if the stick is a twig), people may view it as a licence to break the rules.When two behavioural economists conducted a study at a daycare centre in Israel and introduced a small fine of around £2 for late parents, the amount of latecomers increased. According to the researchers, this was because they could now avoid being guilty by paying the small fine. However, “this is less important when we are talking about rewarding good behaviour,” says Levy.Nava Ashraf, also a LSE economics professor, says that the more that people engage in altruistic acts, the easier it becomes. “We humans notoriously underestimate how happy it makes us to give to others,” she says.Ashraf’s research looks into the long-term impact of incentivising good behaviour. “Giving can become a habit and something people want to continue on their own, even if it isn’t rewarded. Platforms could induce people to start something that they may not otherwise do and in the process, they may learn how much they enjoy it, creating a craving for it,” she says.“We know from neuroscience that the more we do something the more easy it becomes,” she explains. “It goes from something we have to think about to becoming second nature.”Or as Aristotle put it: ‘We are what we repeatedly do.’But Ashraf does caution that getting rewarded for one type of charitable giving “might also make people feel entitled” to get paid for other good deeds, something her research is hoping to shed more light on.For now, the rate of people regularly doing formal volunteer work has remained stable since 2001. If schemes such as ReGain go on to see long-term success, volunteer organisations might consider getting in on the act.“Obviously different groups are motivated by different factors,” says Ostrowski. “For some, the ‘feel good’ factor is enough, and for others, that reward stimulus is required.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

He owns the rival media company Mediaset, and Foa was a journalist at his newspaper, Il Giornale.The source said Foa’s appointment was likely to be detrimental for journalism in Italy. “Foa is a guy who is really in love with the Catholic religion, he hates the EU and loves Russia and Putin, so all of these are red signals that it will be bad for information.”Foa has also repeatedly criticised the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella. When Foa was first mooted for the Rai role, the journalists’ unions FNSI and Usigrai described the potential appointment as “a fatal blow to the autonomy and independence of the public service”.Fake stories shared by Foa on social media have included one during the 2016 US presidential election campaign about Hillary Clinton participating in satanic dinners and another about a supposed plan to overthrow Donald Trump."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bba254cf341adf7e20ffb6a8fc9019ee0dd7053e/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bad95e7d61627b9086d2a3fef37cf244 1000w","title":"mexico president elect andres manuel lopez obrador vows to ditch official plane","story":"López Obrador, delayed by a commercial flight, says he will not use ‘a luxurious plane’Mexico’s leftist president-elect has pledged to stick to his plan to get rid of the country’s presidential plane – despite finding himself stuck on the tarmac for three hours waiting for a commercial flight to take off.In video footage posted online from onboard the delayed flight from Huatulco to Mexico City, Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he would “die of shame” if he used “a luxurious plane in a country where there is so much poverty”.“I’m not going to change my mind because of this,” he said of the delay, which was caused by heavy rain. “Any politician who acts arrogantly won’t last.”López Obrador was using the low-cost airline VivaAerobús. He and other passengers spent three hours on the plane and were then moved back to the terminal to wait for a further hour before they could fly.The 64-year-old, often known by his initials Amlo, convincingly won Mexico’s presidential election in July. He will take office for a five-year term in December.On the campaign trail he pledged to sell the presidential plane and convert the presidential palace into an arts centre. He has also vowed to tackle corruption and apply austerity measures to the running of government. The outgoing president, Enrique Peña Nieto, currently has the use of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which went into service two years ago after being ordered in 2012 by the then president, Felipe Calderón.The aircraft cost $218m and was named after José María Morelos y Pavón, one of the leaders in the Mexican war of independence in the early 1800s. López Obrador has previously criticised the plane’s luxurious fittings, saying “not even Donald Trump has one like it”.The Mexican newspaper Reforma has reported that a businessman, Jimenez Pons, has offered López Obrador $99m for the plane, with a plan to rent it out to world leaders who do not currently have a private jet or to “rock groups like the Rolling Stones”.Some people on social media have questioned whether it is right for López Obrador to risk delays on commercial flights when attending official functions once he is in office."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7de132528a950e9bac8aad86cef9dc0bc53df69/156_395_2670_1602/master/2670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad38cc18cb10a670f1d96612ce608f0f","title":"pakistan criticises china over treatment of ethnic muslims","story":"Minister urges Beijing to soften restrictions on minorities in Xinjiang after reports of abusesPakistan has asked China to soften restrictions on ethnic Muslims in Xinjiang, one of the first public criticisms from a majority Muslim country over China’s policies in the western territory.Xinjiang, home to 12 million Muslims, is the site of a government “strike hard” campaign aimed at countering extremism and other behaviour Beijing has deemed a security threat. Allegations of human rights abuses and widespread repression in Xinjiang have prompted international protest, but few Muslim-majority countries have spoken out.According to the Pakistani newspaper, the Nation, the country’s federal minister for religious affairs, Pir Noorul Haq Qadri, said strict regulations and laws fuel rather than counter extremism. To promote religious harmony, China should exercise patience, the minister told China’s ambassador to Pakistan, Yao Jing.The minister reportedly proposed a delegation of Pakistani scholars visit Xinjiang to help. Emails and calls to Pakistan’s embassy in Beijing were not answered.Criticism of Beijing has increased after a UN panel last month cited “credible reports” that as many as 1 million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other minorities are being held in internment camps. Activists, researchers, and media outlets have documented mass detentions, surveillance, and suppression of cultural and religious life in Xinjiang.China’s neighbours and economic partners are increasingly caught up in the crackdown in Xinjiang, which has accelerated in the last two years after the arrival of communist party secretary Chen Quanguo, dispatched to Xinjiang from Tibet.In March, lawmakers in the northern territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, part of the $62bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, demanded Chinese authorities release 50 Uighur women married to Pakistani men who had been detained in Xinjiang on vague terrorism charges. In Kazakhstan, hundreds of Kazakh families are calling on their government to pressure China to release detained relatives.Beijing has repeatedly defended its policies in Xinjiang. In a press briefing on Wednesday, ministry of foreign affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said tourism to Xinjiang “proves Xinjiang’s current good situation”.On Friday, China’s anti-graft department said it was investigating Nur Bekri, head of the country’s energy planning agency and one the most senior ethnic Uighur officials. Bekri has been accused of “serious violations of discipline and law”, according to the People’s Daily. The term is often a euphemism for corruption.Bekri’s case may not be related to the crackdown in Xinjiang, but the detention of minority officials has been another part of the campaign, according to rights activists. Xinjiang’s governor from 2008 until 2014 and one of few Uighur officials to have gained a national level post, he has supported most of China’s restrictive policies in Xinjiang.“The fate of Nur Bekri is a signal for all Uighurs that no matter how loyal you are to the Chinese communist party, you are the same enemy to them,” said Tahir Imin, an Uighur academic and activist based in the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c0dab1b1470735d2b74dc77f8277878b496d51/0_10_5412_3248/master/5412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb796c6ac2e395938517f02c57c9450d","title":"voulez vous return your pebbles to our mamma mia beach","story":"Greek islanders want tourists to stop pinching marble stones from bay on Skiathos, where parts of Abba movie were filmedUsually at this time of year, Greek beaches are basking in the sunlight of summer’s dying days. But recently the news has been less luminous. First came the terrifying footage, taken by tourists, of a landslide on Zante’s Navagio beach. The collapse of the cliff face only narrowly missed holidaymakers sunbathing on its shores below.Now comes the news that a bay on Skiathos – the island that served, partially, as a backdrop for the first Mamma Mia! film – is losing its smooth pebbles so fast campaigners have been forced to take drastic action.This week containers emblazoned with the words “Lalaria Beach return pebbles box” appeared at Skiathos’s airport as locals stepped up the campaign to save the beach from tourists who crave one of its famously smooth marble stones. “We’ve had no other choice,” said Thodoris Tzoumas, who heads Skiathos’s cultural association. “Lalaria may not have suffered a landslide but human intervention is such that its natural beauty is being destroyed at an alarming rate.”Thanks to pebble pinching whole chunks of its stony shoreline have vanished.The appearance of the honesty boxes follows the announcement of fines up to €1,000 (£894) for tourists found in possession of Lalaria’s celebrated marble stones. Posters have also been pasted on local cruise boats and a billboard placed on the beach exhorting holidaymakers to “take a picture not a pebble”.“Lalaria is not a protected site so the fines were announced in extremis,” the island’s harbour master chief, Nikolaos Katsambas, told the . “Now that all these measures have been taken we hope they will have a deterrent effect.”Campaigners claim the marbles have been disappearing at an alarming rate. Lalaria, on Skiathos’s northern coast, first became famous in the 1970s when the Greek tourist board, attracted by its crystal clear waters, made the bay the country’s poster beach. It shot to global stardom, however, when Hollywood producers used Skiathos as one of the film locations for the first Mamma Mia. This summer’s release of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again has lured even greater numbers of tourists, with many visiting the island to get married or renew vows.A spokeswoman at the local town hall said tourists were not the only culprits. “Residents here have also been taking them to build fancy walls in their gardens and mosaic floors in their homes,” lamented Athina Papageorgiou. “Nature can’t keep up with replenishing the disappearing stock.”According to the island’s cultural association, the larger marbles have almost entirely been eradicated from the beach. “In the past, winds lashing the rocks during the winter months would make up for the losses. But we’ve lost so many over the last decade that that’s no longer enough,” he sighed.As part of the campaign, coastguard officers have also begun conducting inspections as tourists alight from boats running daily cruises to Lalaria, which is only accessible by sea. “They are down there every day and even boat captains are issuing warnings over loudspeakers,” the campaigner added.Authorities at Skiathos’s airport have reportedly long complained of the inexplicably large amount of pebbles discovered in travellers’ luggage.But the appearance of the honesty boxes – following the threat of fines – may be working. “We’ve been pleasantly surprised at the result,” said Tzoumas. “They have only been there a few days and they are beginning to fill up. It’s the last chance for pebble thieves to part with these beautiful stones if they don’t want to be found with them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"The EZ10 driverless shuttle putters along the Docklands at a top speed of 24kmhMinister: \u0026lsquoI make Government policy, but don\u0026rsquot ask me for details.

The important thing is for people to go to busconnects.ie and learn about the plan for yourself and tell us what you think.”Mr Walker also said he did not think he had met with Minister for Transport Shane Ross. “I don’t know if I met with him personally, I know the NTA meet with him all the time, so I know he was in the loop.”When asked if the Minister had any involvement with the design of the Bus Connects network, Mr Walker said the Minister had delegated that to the NTA staff “who are the experts in that and we designed the plan around the table with NTA and Dublin Bus and staff from the councils.“He (Mr Ross) was certainly there sitting next to us when we announced it and began the consultations several weeks ago.“It was my understanding that the NTA’s role was precisely to develop the plan for the Minister.”The BusConnects scheme involves changes to bus routes into Dublin city, and a €2 billion investment in the network.Mr Walker explained that about eight per cent of existing bus users would no longer have a direct bus to the city centre under the plan, they would have to change from a bus to another bus or very often from a bus to a train (DartLuas).“In almost all cases they would actually get to the city sooner by doing that because we would run much more frequent services. This is a big point all through the plan.“The plan is based on the notion that the way to get people to more places sooner so they can get to more places and do more things, is to ask people to interchange a little bit more, that sounds wrong, but it’s actually how the math works.“That’s actually how you build the most efficient system because it lets you build simple routes that are very frequent so that it’s very easy for routes to connect with one another.“It’s very much the way most European systems work.We looked at the whole demand of travel across Dublin, there’s the city centre, we know what’s there, we look at the universities, we look at the hospitals, we look at shopping centres, at the outlying major employment centres, we look at all of those, we know exactly where they are, we understand where people are going and then we try to lay out a network that lets people get to any of them, so what you have right now is a network that’s very good for going to the city centre, but it’s very frustrating often to try to go any where else and if Dublin is going to be able to prosper, if Dublin is not going to choke to death on cars, it has to be possible to use public transport to go many more places and for it to be much more useful for many more trips.“We have to stop forcing people to own cars because the public transport isn’t there for them and that’s what the plan strives to do.”Mr Walker said he was not surprised at the protests. “I’m not surprised that people are alarmed, I certainly wish we had gotten better information out sooner, I take responsibility for that.“I would also say there has been a pretty intense campaign to confuse and enrage people that has come from one of the two unions representing bus drivers, I’m referring to the National Bus and Rail Union, they have been putting out alarming and misleading information almost from the moment that the plan came out.”He called on the public to examine the plan and to make comments. “We want your comments. We’re going to take it back and revise it.“This plan is not done, this plan is a draft, tell us your opinion.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3636946.1537528621!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the future arrives as driverless bus takes to the streets of dublin","story":" The EZ10 Driverless Shuttle, built in France, was demoed in Dublin and has no steering wheel, no wing mirrors and of course no driver. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            The EZ10 has no driver and travels at an easy going top speed of 24kmh.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe first driverless bus has arrived on the streets of Dublin. The EZ10 Driverless Shuttle, built in France, has no steering wheel, no wing mirrors and of course no driver.It has a top speed of just 24 kmh and will win no awards for aesthetic design, it resembles a high tech milk float, but it is 100 per cent powered by electricity.It trundled up and down a section of the Dublin Docklands opposite the Convention Centre and the public will get a chance to glimpse the future when it takes passengers on Saturday and Sunday.It has already arrived in several cities across Europe. The EZ10 operates in Paris where it can transport up to 15 people from the Château de Vincennes metro station to Bois de Vincennes, the largest public park in Paris.In Sweden the vehicles mix with existing traffic in the new Stockholm suburb Barkarby and they ferry students to and from the University of Frankfurt.The EZ10 operates via GPS and artificial intelligence. It can read road signs and automatically brakes in the event of a collision.The vehicle is built by the company, EasyMile, in Toulouse and 100 are now in service.EasyMile spokesman Clément Delbouys said the company is targeting Dublin as a future destination.“The idea is now that we are here, we really want to provide a service for Dublin. It could be at the university, the port or the airport. We want to showcase what we can do on the streets of Dublin,”Dublin City Council manager Owen Keegan said he was convinced that driverless vehicles can be safer than the alternative.He envisaged that such vehicles would work transporting people from bus and train stops to their eventual destination. “We are talking about the last mile. I think a fleet of semi-autonomous vehicles could make a major contribution.”He said they will operate on the road in an environment where there will be “very few” single-occupancy cars on the streets of the capital city in the future.However, he said that these vehicles may be “at least five years away. There are still major technological and regulatory issues around them. It is inevitable, but it will take a bit of time.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3636813.1537512561!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu leaders reject theresa may s brexit proposals","story":"French president Emmanuel Macron has said the Brexit plan proposed by British prime minister Theresa May was unacceptable in its current form and that he expected new proposals from Britain in October.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May looks back following an EU leaders’ group photo on the second day of a summit in Salzburg, Austria. Photograph: Sean GallupGetty ImagesThe prospect of an agreement between the EU and the UK on Brexit before time runs out on the process is as far away as ever after a fractious EU summit in Austria which saw Theresa May’s proposals roundly rejected by EU leaders, who reiterated their support for Ireland’s demands on the border backstop.Although all sides reiterated their determination to reach a deal before an anticipated special Brexit summit in mid-November, events in Salzburg demonstrated the chasm between the two sides is as great as ever.European Council president Donald Tusk closed the summit by saying unambiguously that although there were positive elements in Mrs May’s Chequers plan, it was not acceptable to the EU in its present form. Significantly, however, he added it was necessary for both the British and the EU to compromise.But the dismissal of the Chequers plan was seized on gleefully by hardline Brexiteers in London, and British media outlets were reporting the outcome as a catastrophe and a humiliation for Mrs May – weakening her in advance of the Conservative Party conference. Nonetheless, Mrs May indicated she would bring forward new proposals on the backstop in the coming weeks, though senior Irish sources said there was little expectation that anything of substance would be forthcoming until after her party conference at the end of this month.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar held a bilateral meeting with Mrs May, which both sides described as useful, but Mr Varadkar was keen to stress that the EU was united behind Ireland in seeking movement on the British position on the border backstop.“All the EU leaders who spoke gave me their absolute support in standing behind Ireland,” Mr Varadkar told journalists, “and saying that an agreement that doesn’t work for Ireland doesn’t work for the EU. I am leaving here very reassured.”Mr Varadkar said he was willing to compromise in the negotiations, but that Ireland could not step back from its requirement to have a legally enforceable guarantee that there would be no hard border in Ireland, even if the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU did not ensure it.An intensive few weeks of negotiation between the EU and UK teams will commence in October in advance of a scheduled summit in Brussels on October 18-19th. Though few expect agreement to be reached by then, EU leaders will decide whether there is sufficient prospect of an agreement to hold a special summit in mid-November.But with a no-deal Brexit – where the UK crashes out of the union next March – increasingly possible, the Irish Government is increasing Brexit preparations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told the Cabinet on Tuesday he now expected to bring details of Brexit contingency planning forward regularly – proposals expected to cost tens of millions of euros in additional staffing and other costs. A no-deal scenario is understood to have been discussed with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier when the two men met in Brussels on Wednesday.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Bryan O\u0027Brien\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tInto battle: Michael D Higgins at the first day of  the National Ploughing Championships at Screggan in Co Offaly. Photograph: Tom HonanThe  It wasn’t so much a speech as a performance.“Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,” cried Michael D, galloping back to battle with a small pair of scissors, a length of green ribbon and an extravagant sweep of the arm.Those weren’t the actual words spoken by the President – but it’s the essence of what he said during a rousing 20-minute speech on the ploughing fields of Screggan.There was no time for subtlety in his soliloquy, for not only was he officially opening the National Ploughing Championships, he was also unofficially opening his campaign to win a second term as president of Ireland.Seven years a slave to constitutional constraint can be difficult for any occupant of Áras an Uachtaráin, but it must place a particular strain on somebody like Michael D Higgins, who was always very partial to a blistering political argument.So when he made this latest trip to open the largest outdoor event in Europe this year, he had much more to do than merely cut a ribbon and utter some stirring words about our deep-rooted connection to the land.Michael D was a man on a mission, at the start of a mission.He is not yet officially off the leash, but you wouldn’t have known that on Tuesday. President Higgins was only short of dancing up to the microphone when called upon to speak.“May I say what a great pleasure it is to be here again at . . . the Ploughing!” And with that, he was off, chewing the scenery with quivering gusto, waving around the fistful of papers he would have been consulting had he not sashayed off script within minutes.There was hardly need for amplification as he held forth like a veteran thespian declaiming to the audience at the back of the theatre, only he was standing in the middle of a field, and the back of the house was the Slieve Bloom Mountains.There were extravagant sweeps of the arm and, at one stage, a hand held high in the air like Jim Larkin’s statue in O’Connell Street. Which is fair enough, as big Jim and the 1913 lockout was mentioned in the course of the speech, after which the President launched himself into a simmering throng of admirers in front of the stage.Also mentioned was the 19th-century writer and revolutionary James Fintan Lalor who spoke of the right of the people to live on the land in security, comfort and independence.“We remember him as well as all of the others we paid tribute to over the last few years: Tone and Pearse and Connolly and others,” carolled Michael D, before reflecting on the next period of national commemoration to come next year when “we’ll be celebrating the first Dáil with all its great promise”.A reminder stitched in there for potential voters of how, as President, he presided over the delicate 1916 centenary commemorations.He spoke of the importance of the ploughing festival, which “invites all of the people of Ireland to realise the importance of farming as a way of life and of the importance of sustaining it and addressing its issues in a practical way”.As President Higgins spoke, one of his rivals for the job, Seán Gallagher, stood to one side of the platform, also facing the crowd.The man who came second in the election seven years ago was one of two former Dragons’ Den participants who were also on the Áras trail in the sprawling Screggan grounds.It was a bold move by the candidate, who pressed the flesh and made himself very visible in the vicinity of the President. At midday, when Michael D eventually made it through a crush of well-wishers to the stage, Seán had already strategically positioned himself at the foot of the steps. The President would have to pass by him, but so too did a battalion of men in green IFA blazers augmented by a few more wearing chains of office. They blocked the view. Gallagher moved forward, to no avail. Snubbed?But no. Somebody must have whispered something to Michael D because he turned and belted his way past the blocking blazers and warmly greeted the businessman, thanking him for a note he had sent to him.“So, I’ll see you shortly,” said Seán.“Oh, you will,” replied President Higgins, loudly.He told reporters he will begin his campaign in about a week’s time.“I’ve never run away from a campaign in my life, for goodness sake,” he declared, adding that he had been fighting them for nearly 40 years.Whatever happens, he hoped the campaign would be dignified and about “the real issues”.It was a difficult beat for the three declared candidates who were in Laois for the first day of the championships. Joan Freeman, Gallagher and Gavin Duffy strolled around the stands and exhibitions, doing their best to meet as many people as possible. Duffy’s small team had a big roll of stickers which they tried to hand out to passing children.He was with his wife Orlaith, and they wore matching wellies. Lovely expensive Dubarry boots which were admired by many.They did interviews and did their best to explain how it’s early days and the opinion polls putting Higgins miles ahead are not indicative of how the situation could change as the campaign progresses. Gallagher and Duffy, while expressing undying admiration for the incumbent, stressed the need for him to participate fully in any TV debates.Michael D, for his part, was letting it be known that he is up for the fight. He spent the day visiting stands while his security details, gardaí and a private security firm hired by the National Ploughing Association kept the crowds at bay as best they could. The President was mobbed.Not a good thing for the candidates to see. Screggan belonged to President Higgins. He was the star of the show on Tuesday. They will have to engage on different fronts if they are to peg back his lead. They will. They have to.The only VIP who got a very positive reception and a surprisingly high recognition rate from the crowd was the new Garda Commissioner Drew Harris. He was the recipient of good wishes from many people as he got his first experience of the ploughing.As the afternoon wore on, news came through that a third “dragon” had made the ballot sheet. Peter Casey is the latest alumnus of the business themed entertainment programme to join the chasing pack.What should they be called: A showboat of Dragons? A bluster? A congratulation?Michael D worked his way though a large number of stands. Loving it. He met Jessica McGrath from Monkstown in Dublin who told him her grandmother Maureen Sheehan was delighted to received her 100th birthday cheque from him last Wednesday.Meanwhile, Marie Finneran from Laois managed to get the President to sign a hurley for her son Luka (12), who plays for Four Roads.“It’ll be used in the under-12 county final on Saturday against St Dominick’s,” said Marie.The campaign is under way in earnest.Oh, yes he has.This is going to be fun."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3637034.1537536496!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shane ross insists he is fully committed to bus connects","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Transport Shane Ross has been accused of being disconnected from his brief. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe  Minister for Transport Shane Ross has insisted he is fully committed to the Bus Connects project despite having told a residents’ association meeting in his constituency he had nothing to do with it and had no responsibility for the National Transport Authority. During the meeting Mr Ross indicated that he would be making his own submission to the ongoing public consultation on the plan and objecting to some aspects of it.According to one person present, when he saw a proposed route map for the Bus Connects plan at the meeting, he told attendees: “Don’t mind this map.”Responding to a report on the residents’ association meeting in The  on Friday, Mr Ross rejected allegations he had disavowed any knowledge of the Bus Connects proposals.“I wanted to make it clear that, yes, I make Government policy, but don’t ask me for details. I don’t micro manage.“If you have a problem in your particular area, it’s up to you to make a submission, but don’t come to me to change a route. That’s not my job, that map was not drawn up by me,” he told RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.Mr Ross was speaking at the agm of the Nutgrove Loreto Community Association, in the Rathfarnham-Churchtown area of his constituency.“The level of disconnect is not appropriate from a Minister,” said Ms Martin while Cllr Brennan added: “either the Minister is in denial or he was playing to the audience. If he’s not interested he should step aside.”Mr Ross responded: “This sounds suspiciously like a local spat when this is an important issue.”Ms Martin accused Mr Ross of behaving like an Opposition TD while in Government. “He can’t have it both ways.”Mr Ross said the National Transport Authority (NTA) makes the decisions, not him. “I don’t make decisions, but I will be making a submission on behalf of the people in my constituency who are greatly inconvenienced. It’s a very good project, but there are problems that must be ironed out, that’s why there is a consultation process. I’ve no responsibility for the detail of Bus Connects, that’s why we employ the NTA to be separate so there isn’t political interference. Of course I’m going to relay the worries of my constituents.”He said the map being used at public meetings was “only a proposal which will be adjusted in the near future. The NTA will report to me when it has a new proposal and there could be a second consultation.”Mr Ross said he was committed to the project as it was important, but he was not going to direct the NTA “to put one route here or another one there”.Labour leader Brendan Howlin said the Minister’s comments would make “you weep”. In atweet he said: “The Minister for Transport says he’s not responsible for transport. Read the manual! (There is one). Every Minster is personally responsible for every act of hisher department and all agencies operating under it!”However, the Taoiseach said Bus Connects needed “major modifications” even though it was what he described as the best plan for the future of urban bus transport. He said he had met the NTA chief executive last week to discuss concerns. “It is a €2 billion investment to improve bus services not just in Dublin but also in Cork and Galway . . . Bus Connects, if it is done properly, can reduce bus journeys by half.” The Taoiseaach went on to say it was important to get it right. “I really think what is required now is the NTA take on the concerns expressed by the people of Dublin and make major modifications to the plan.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3637120.1537539907!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit may says eu must come up with alternative proposals","story":"British prime minister Theresa May has said that the EU must present alternative Brexit proposals after the UK\u0027s Chequers proposal was rejected during a summit in Salzburg. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May says it is ’not acceptable’ for EU leaders to reject her plan in the absence of an alternative. Photograph:  ReutersBritish prime minister Theresa May says the EU must now come up with an alternative to her Brexit proposals, saying the talks had reached an impasse after bloc’s leaders rejected her plans without explaining why.At a summit in Austria on Thursday, EU leaders said they would push for a Brexit deal next month but rejected Mrs May’s “Chequers” plan, saying she need to give ground on trade and arrangements for the Irish Border.“It’s not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals,” Mr May said in a televised statement on Friday.“So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are, what their alternative is, so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress.”Ms May said the Brexit negotiations were at an impasse. She also said the best outcome from the negotiations was for her country to leave the bloc with a deal but exiting with no deal would be better than a bad deal.Under Mrs May’s Chequers proposal Britain would remain aligned with EU regulations for goods and agricultural products but not for services, gaining partial access to the single market without having to accept all its responsibilities such as the free movement of people.The EU insists there can be no return to a hard border in Ireland, with Northern Ireland remaining in the bloc’s customs union or effectively establishing a border in the Irish Sea if no alternative deal is reached. This arrangement is known as the backstop.However, Mrs May says she could not agree to any deal which treated Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the United Kingdom.“I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country,” Mrs May said. “We need serious engagement on resolving the two main problems in the negotiations and we stand ready.”Earlier on Friday Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Brexit talks are entering a “rocky patch”. However, he expressed confidence a deal will be ultimately brokered between the European Union and the United Kingdom and said he was determined to avoid a cliff-edge scenario next March.Mr Varadkar said there had been assertions in the British media in recent weeks that had been way off the mark and had led to false expectations in Britain as to the outcome.Speaking from the National Ploughing Championships in Screggan, Co Offaly he said “there was a sense created in the UK press that there was ision around the EU table, among the EU 27. There is not. The EU is totally united, not just united behind Ireland but also united behind the single market.“Perhaps the sense was created that prime minister May would come away with something more positive than occurred. I don’t think anyone in the EU or Ireland is to blame for that.“Ultimately the problems that are created for Britain and the British government are being created as a consequence of Brexit and nobody in EU and Ireland is to blame for that,” he said.Britain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab claimed on Friday morning some EU leaders had shown unstatesmanlike behaviour in Salzburg.“We’ve already compromised hugely with the Chequers proposals. We’ve engaged and we want to hear more about what the real critique of it is and we’ve got no other credible alternatives on the table,” Mr Raab told the BBC.“What we’re not going to do is be salami sliced throughout this negotiation in a typical style that the EU engages in without movement on the other side.”Many newspapers led their front pages with a Reuters picture showing Mrs May, dressed in a red jacket, standing apparently aloof and alone from a mass of suited male EU leaders.Few diplomats expected any breakthrough from the Salzburg summit as the EU has repeatedly made clear that Mrs May must rework the Chequers proposals.The tone of some of their comments, particularly the irony of European Council President Donald Tusk, left May exposed at home as she heads into what is expected to be a tumultuous annual conference of her Conservative Party on September 30th. - Agencies"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3637000.1537531712!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may ambushed by her own disastrous brexit strategy","story":"British prime minister Theresa May has said that the EU must present alternative Brexit proposals after the UK\u0027s Chequers proposal was rejected during a summit in Salzburg. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May at the back entrance of 10 Downing Street in London on Friday. Photograph: Peter NichollsReuters Theresa May was, according to much of the British press, the victim of an ambush at Salzburg when EU leaders declared her Chequers plan unworkable and said there will be no Brexit deal without a legally operable backstop for the Border. But if the prime minister was ambushed by anything it was by the reality that her plan for partial access to the single market was always doomed and by her own disastrous strategy for keeping it alive.It was Britain, not the EU, that hyped the Salzburg meeting in advance as a moment of truth for Brexit, spinning that it was May’s chance to sell the Chequers plan directly to the other leaders. Two days before the meeting, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab suggested that the choice was between Chequers and no deal and said that Britain’s “unionist parliament” could never accept a backstop that treated Northern Ireland differently than the rest of the UK for customs.May repeated that uncompromising message in an article in the German daily Die Welt on Wednesday morning and again to the leaders that night. And on Thursday morning she told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that there could be no deal on the backstop by next month’s EU summit.May needed the EU leaders to remain at least non-committal on Chequers and to allow the wrangling over the Border to drift on until a special Brexit summit in November. But her intransigent message at Salzburg provoked them into plain speaking, declaring Chequers dead and warning that there would be no November summit and no withdrawal agreement without progress on the backstop.The prime minister’s allies sought on Friday morning to play down the scale of the setback she suffered at Salzburg, insisting that Chequers remained a basis for negotiation and talking tough about the Border. But nobody in government or in the Conservative Party will be in any doubt that it has been an utter humiliation for May and that the Brexit negotiations have taken an important turn.Now that Chequers has been pronounced dead, May is left with three obvious options: Norway, Canada and no deal. Remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA) like Norway, plus membership of the customs union, would solve the problem of the Border and would not violate EU principles. But it crosses all of the prime minister’s red lines and could not command a majority in the House of Commons.A Canada-style free trade agreement would please Brexiteers on the Conservative back benches and be acceptable to the EU but it would not address the issue of the Border, so a deal on the backstop would still be necessary.If May sticks to her rigid approach on the backstop and the EU remains firm on the issue, there will be no withdrawal agreement and Britain will leave the EU with no deal and no transition arrangement on March 29th next year. This would be an economic calamity for Britain and could be politically disastrous for the Conservatives. Parliament could reject a no-deal Brexit, perhaps triggering a general election or a second referendum.There is a fourth option, for a so-called “blind Brexit” based on a withdrawal agreement and a vague political declaration about the future relationship. This would have some chance of approval in parliament and if there is a withdrawal agreement, the transition period would prevent a cliff-edge Brexit. This still requires a deal on the backstop and if Britain continues to resist the EU’s proposal, it must come up with its own by early October.\u0026nbspMay, Raab and other ministers have not ruled out regulatory checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland but insist that there can be no customs border in the Irish Sea and that the North cannot be part of a different customs territory from the rest of the UK. MPs in all parties supported an amendment to a customs Bill before the summer recess endorsing that position, although the Bill is still in the Lords and has not become law.If Britain and the EU agree a regime for regulatory checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, can they find a creative formulation to allow different customs rules to apply in the North too? The future of Brexit, Theresa May and the British economy may depend on the answer to that question."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/30/TELEMMGLPICT000132346107_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhNkvlguSCLNAbLFJA3hmlxSyV74PnrmMVLeDsGCONQM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"government draws plans social media regulator following telegraph","story":"Ministers have started drafting proposals for new laws to regulate social media and the internet after a Daily  campaignDuty of Care CampaignBanner: Duty of CareMinisters have started drafting proposals for new laws to regulate social media and the internet after a Daily  campaign.The move has been prompted by widespread consumer concerns over a range of online harms including child abuse, bullying, fake news and internet addiction.The white paper is being drafted by three government departments – the home office, culture and health – but it is still unclear if they will introduce a wide-ranging statutory duty of care.The Daily  has been campaigning for such a duty of care to provide bullet proof protection for parents and children from online harms. Last week the Labour party formally backed a duty of care as its policy.A culture department spokesman said: This winter we will publish a White Paper, setting out new laws to tackle the full range of online harms and set clear responsibilities for tech companies to keep UK citizens safe.“We are considering all options, including what legislation will be necessary and whether a regulator is needed.”Some campaigners remain concerned the government may still back away from statutory regulation.Margot James, the minister responsible for the internet at the culture department, said: “The issue we have to settle is whether to regulate or not.”Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, has adopted a cautious approach since taking over from Matt Hancock this summer. This week he warned he would not rush into creating “flawed” legislation but wanted to get it right.Duty of care puffHe revealed he will visit Germany next week to review its laws against online hate speech. Along with Australia and France, it is one of the few countries to have successfully introduced legislation to crackdown on the internet firms.In the past week both of Britain’s key regulators – Ofcom and the information commissioner – have backed new regulation on the tech giants.Sharon White, Ofcom’s chief executive, outlined a potential blueprint for regulating social media platforms, saying they should be forced to remove inappropriate material quickly or face fines.Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, said voluntary regulation of the tech giants was no longer sustainable. She said: The time has come for more rules and more controls to protect iniduals against some of the harms that are of deep public concern.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreResearch published by the two revealed one in five Britons – 12m people – had been harmed by online content or conduct with social media firms blamed for the vast bulk.Ministers refused to be drawn on whether there would be a new regulator for the tech firms or if responsibilities could be taken over by Ofcom.A green paper earlier this year proposed a statutory code of conduct for tech giants, who would also be forced to publish annual reports on how quickly and effectively they took down harmful content.Andy Burrows, NSPCC Associate Head of Child Safety Online, said: “Children face unacceptable risks when using social networks, so tough regulation is needed to keep them safe and any legislation must have child safety at its heart.”Duty of Care CampaignPlease review our commenting policyDefiant Theresa May tells EU, show us some respect as she refuses to back down on Brexit - live updatesEuropean Court to rule whether MPs can unilaterally cancel BrexitComment: Theresa May has called out the EU and its sneery President in her own Love Actually momentTheresa May\u0026#39s Brexit statement in full Comment: The Brexiteers are Romantics, but they need to be ruthlessComment: Macron\u0026#39s attack on May over Brexit was all part of his bid to become the big man of EuropeComment: The EU\u0026#39s brutality to Theresa May is turning Remainers into the hardest of BrexiteersStrictly Come Dancing 2018: Debbie McGee on trusting your partner and what they all really think of the training videosComment: The problem isn\u0026#39t the EU or Brexit.

Jessie had that week received good results in a college assessment, and was looking forward to the visit of a penfriend from Australia. She told her mother she would be home on Friday.On Friday night there was no sign of Jessie. ‘We thought she must have missed the last train,’ her mother Valerie says. ‘But in the morning there was still no phone call. So I went shopping and came back, and I just thought, there’s something not right.

Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Olivia was the most popular name for baby girls in each of the nine English regions in 2017 as well as in Wales, with Amelia the second favourite everywhere except the South West of England where Isla was in second.Although Oliver did rank top nationally, unlike Olivia, it was not universally popular. Muhammad was the top boys\u0027 name in London, Yorkshire and the Humber and the West Midlands while Harry was top in the North East for boys for the second year running.There was relatively little movement in the top 10 spots for both boys and girls. Lily replaced Poppy in the top 10 girls’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2015. Leo replaced Thomas in the top 10 for boys’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2016.The statistics, compiled by the ONS, are derived from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations.

Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the rankings.Nick Stripe, Vital Statistics Outputs Branch, Office for National Statistics said: Although Oliver and Olivia remained the most popular baby names in 2017, some fascinating changes took place beneath them.Leo entered the boys’ top 10 for the first time, whilst Hunter rocketed into the top 100, also for the first time, reaching number 78.Sarah, the most popular name for baby girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since our records began in 1904. Brand new entries into the top 100 for girls include the names Aurora and HallieThere were only two new entries into the top 100 most popular boys’ names in 2017 for England and Wales: Hunter and Ralph replaced Aaron and Jasper, which were in the top 100 in 2016.There were six new entries in the top 100 most popular girls’ names in 2017 in England and Wales: Aurora, Orla, Edith, Bonnie, Lyla and Hallie replaced Lexi, Zoe, Maddison, Sarah, Felicity and Lydia.The influence of popular culture continues to seemingly provide inspiration for new parents.

They include other software tools such as frustration free setup, which allows new devices to be set up without fiddling with controls.The Guard feature is set by saying something to Alexa such as Alexa, I\u0027m leaving. At that point, she will start her watch – or listening – and report anything unusual.As well as listening out, Alexa can also turn lights on and off in a randomised way that makes it appear that someone is still in the house. And it will connect up with alarm systems from companies like Amazon-owned Ring to make sure all of those tools are working together.As well as listening out for suspect noises, Alexa will also check to see if users are whispering. If they are, it will start to listen too, ensuring that it doesn\u0027t wake people up.Amazon said that both of those listening features rely on advanced artificial intelligence that has been trained in detailed ways to recognise those sounds and react to them.Other new Alexa features announced at the same event include Hunches. That allows the assistant to learn about how you use your house, and warn you if you seem to be deviating in a usual way – if it sees you\u0027re going to bed but have left your living room light on, for instance, it will alert you and ask if it needs to be turned off.And in the event of the internet going down, which normally kills all the feature of\u0026nbspAlexa, Amazon is also introducing local voice control so that devices can still be controlled.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/11/rtx3knpu.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1667  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/11/rtx3knpu.jpg","title":"natwest rbs ulster bank down online mobile banking service latest when back up","story":"Created with Sketch.Customers were unable to access accounts online or via mobile app on Friday morningClick to followThe IndependentRBS chief exec Ross McEwan said he did not know what had caused the problem on Friday morningRBS and Natwest online and mobile banking services restored, bank saysNatwest\u0027s online and mobile banking services have been restored after going down due to a tech glitch earlier on Friday,\u0026nbspthe bank has said.NatWest is owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, and some customers of RBS also reported\u0026nbspissues with the digital and mobile banking services on Friday.

So it can be worth going through your network, and paying upfront for the phone with them while still committing to a phone plan.If you\u0027re on the other side of that situation – you don\u0027t want to pay upfront at all, and offset the cost through the length of the plan – then there are plenty of ways to do that. Obviously, you will pay for it in that the price over the two years will add up to significantly more, but you\u0027ll also have the benefit of never having to make such a significant outlay.There are plenty of networks offering limited upfront payments, such as Virgin Mobile, which claims to have the cheapest deal with no upfront costs. You can get the Xs for £41 per month without any initial payment, and pay an extra £9 for a full 50GB per month.The least painful way to get the iPhone Xs or Xs Max is probably to go somewhere in between. Which is best will depend on how much you want to pay upfront and what sort of allowances you want, of course, but the networks are falling over themselves to offer you deals on the new phone.Three, for instance, is asking for £59 for all you can eat data with a £99 payment at the beginning. It\u0027s not the cheapest deal, but unlimited data is rare, and it is decent.The Max is £5 more from Three. And you can add another £6 on top per month to get some AirPods, too.If you\u0027re concerned about committing for two years – especially when next year\u0027s iPhone is likely to offer more spectacular upgrades than the Xs – then you might want to consider Sky Mobile, which allows people to upgrade every year with its Swap12 plan.\u0026nbspThe Xs starts at £59 per month on that plan, with a £99 upfront payment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/11/rtx3knpu.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1667  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/11/rtx3knpu.jpg","title":"natwest rbs ulster bank down online mobile banking service latest when back up","story":"Created with Sketch.Customers were unable to access accounts online or via mobile app on Friday morningClick to followThe IndependentRBS chief exec Ross McEwan said he did not know what had caused the problem on Friday morningRBS and Natwest online and mobile banking services restored, bank saysNatwest\u0027s online and mobile banking services have been restored after going down due to a tech glitch earlier on Friday,\u0026nbspthe bank has said.NatWest is owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, and some customers of RBS also reported\u0026nbspissues with the digital and mobile banking services on Friday.

The UK expects the same, a good relationship at the end of this process depends on it,” she said.“At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals. So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress.”The EU has proposed a backstop agreement of customs checks in the Irish sea as a way to avoid a hard border descending between Northern Ireland and Ireland after the UK leaves the customs union and single market.But Ms May says this would be an intolerable incursion on UK sovereignty. It would also risk collapsing her Government, since Northern Ireland’s DUP, on whose votes her government relies, also vehemently rejects the proposal.In her statement, the Prime Minister said it would mean Northern Ireland would be “permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea” and that no UK prime minister would ever agree to that“If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake,” she said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/25/12/m5-main-pub.jpg  width= 2500  height= 2500  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/25/12/m5-main-pub.jpg","title":"super bowl 2019 maroon 5 halftime show performer adam levine who","story":"Created with Sketch.Los Angeles based pop band to perform in AtlantaClick to followThe Independent CultureMaroon 5 formed in Los Angeles in the 1990s.

A substantial minority of Labour supporters voted Leave in 2016. Many Labour MPs fear that support for a referendum could cost them votes at the next election.“YouGov’s figures do not bear this out. Of the YouGov respondents who currently support Labour and voted Leave in the Brexit referendum, only 6 per cent put Brexit at the top of their concerns and say they would not, or be less likely to, vote Labour if the party backed a popular vote.“This is just two per cent of all Labour supporters, or just over 200,000 voters\u0026nbspin all.”All 27 EU leaders believe May\u0027s Brexit trade plan \u0027will not work\u0027The best comments from the Reddit AMA with Alastair Campbell\u0027It\u0027s ok to change your mind over Brexit\u0027, explains new short filmLabour could stop Brexit from destroying Britain\u0027s heartlandsProsecco exports from Italy to UK fall for first time in 10 yearsMacron urges EU leaders to stand firm against May in Brexit talksHe explained that once these voters were subtracted from those gained by a pledge to back a new referendum, the net increase is some 1.5 million\u0026nbspvotes.Mr Kellner added: “Like all such hypothetical exercises, different ways of asking the questions and doing the sums will yield different results.“But the nine-to-one gulf between the non-Labour target voters and the at-risk Labour supporters leaves no doubt that by backing a popular vote on Brexit, the party would end up making significant gains in votes and seats. In a tight general election, it could make the difference between returning to government and remaining in opposition.”With those figures layered on the whole country, Labour would stand to gain around 60 seats across the UK.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina

by the group Represent Us, drilled down into specific constituencies by polling in 107 marginal seats across the UK with a majority of less than 3,500.Across the 82 seats in England and Wales it found Labour would leapfrog the Tories in vote share with a pledge to back the new vote, going from a point behind in 2017 to a point in front, down in large part to stealing support from the Liberal Democrats.That would indicate Labour holding its 35 most marginal seats in England and Wales and winning a further 16 from the Conservatives – despite at least 38 of these having backed Leave in 2016.Backing a new referendum would also allow Labour to minimise potential losses against a dominant SNP in Scotland, according to the ICM data.Dozens of motions have been tabled ahead of Labour’s conference in Liverpool in a bid to get the party to vote on backing a new referendum on Brexit, with several unions having already thrown their weight behind the idea in the run up.There is also set to be a rally for a People’s Vote on Sunday in Liverpool right outside the party’s main conference event.The Independent understands that the leadership will likely stick to its commitment to keep the option of a vote on the table, without giving explicit support to one.Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy urged his party to back a new referendum, saying: “What these figures show is that supporting a People’s Vote is also the right thing for the party to do if we want\u0026nbspto win a general election.“This should concentrate some minds at our conference in Liverpool next week.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account

\u0027will not work’, says Donald TuskEU council president mocks Theresa May on Instagram with \u0027cake\u0027 gag after Salzburg humiliationThe president of the European Council has rubbed salt into the wounds of Theresa May’s Brexit humiliation in Salzburg by mocking her negotiating strategy on Instagram.\u0026nbspDuring the summit Donald Tusk ushered the Prime Minister over to a strategically positioned tray of cakes and offered her a morsel to eat.It was only after the closing of proceedings that it became clear that the former Polish prime minister had something else in mind than Ms May’s appetite.He posted a picture on Instagram of the prime minister and himself at the cake stand with the caption: “A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.”The rinsing is a reference to a running joke in Brussels that Britain wants to “have its cake and eat it” in talks. The UK has also been accused of “cherrypicking” because it wants to stay in the parts of the single market it likes but not the parts it doesn’t like.The EU insists that its single market can only be taken as a package at a press conference concluding the summit on Thursday Mr Tusk said all 27 EU leaders agreed that Ms May’s Chequers plan could not work, not least because it cherry-picked the single market.The “cake” gag originated after Boris Johnson proclaimed that Britain could “have its cake and eat it” – comments which were seized upon by EU leaders and officials.The “philosophy of cake”, as Mr Tusk has previously described it, has also now more generally entered the Brussels lexicon in areas beyond Brexit as a description of a negotiating party being unreasonable and wanting advantages without responsibilities.The Prime Minister was visibly shaking and upset at her press conference at the end of the Salzburg meeting following the full-throated rejection of her plan by the other EU leaders, which sources ahead of the summit did not expect in such vivid terms.\u0026nbspBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The Labour leader said:\u0026nbsp“Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.\u0026nbsp“From day one, the prime minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain.\u0026nbsp“The political games from both the EU and our government need to end because no deal is not an option.”The Liberal Democrats have called on Theresa May to recall Parliament. The party\u0027s Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, said:“The prime minister has had the most humiliating European summit in recent memory and\u0026nbspreturned\u0026nbspwith a tattered Chequers deal, making a no-deal Brexit more\u0026nbsplikely\u0026nbspthan ever.\u0026nbsp“Two years down the line and the only consensus the PM has made across Parliament and the EU is that Chequers is unworkable.\u0026nbsp“Instead of pontificating to television cameras,\u0026nbspMay must now recall Parliament to explain how she got the country into this terrible mess, what her plan is to get us out of it, and when we can have a people’s vote and an exit from Brexit.”Where does Theresa May\u0027s statement leave matters? Well, virtually where they were yesterday. The prime minister did not say anything that could be deemed a game-changer, instead doubling down on her Chequers plan and showing no intention to budge.\u0026nbspWe wait to see how the EU responds, but it has repeatedly made clear that it will not accept the UK\u0027s current proposals.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s no doubt that the prospects of Britain crashing out the EU without a deal have increased this week. The two sides are further apart than ever, even though 80 per cent of a deal has already been agreed. But an agreement is clearly in the interests of the both the UK and the EU, so don\u0027t be surprised if there is some movement towards a compromise in the weeks to come. With a deal needing to be agreed by the end of the year though, both sides will know that time is rapidly running out...May admitted Brexit negotiations were at an impasse. She said:\u0026nbspYesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market.\u0026nbsp He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal.\u0026nbsp So we are at an impasse.She laid the blame for the deadlock firmly at the EU\u0027s door, saying:\u0026nbspThroughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.\u0026nbspAt this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.\u0026nbspSo we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress.In the meantime, we must and will continue the work of preparing ourselves for no deal.So what was new in Theresa May\u0027s statement? Two things:\u0026nbsp1. She guaranteed the rights of EU citizens in the UK even in the case of an no-deal Brexit.2. She also offered a glimpse of what the UK\u0027s new proposal for a Northern Ireland customs backstop will look like. May re-iterated that the UK will not accept new customs checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain but hinted that it could accept new regulatory checks - IF the Northern Ireland Assembly agrees to it.\u0026nbspThe ner in the works, of course, is that the Assembly has not sat since the start of last year after power-staring collapsed. Could restoring devolution in Northern Ireland now be crucial to finalising a Brexit deal?May says denying the legitimacy of the Brexit vote threatens public trust in our democracy.\u0026nbspShe says:\u0026nbspNo-one wants a good deal more than me, but the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country.\u0026nbspHurling the ball into Brussels court, she finishes by saying:\u0026nbspWe need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations, and we stand ready.\u0026nbspAnd with that she turns and leaves the room.\u0026nbspMay promises that the rights of EU citzens living in the UK will be protected even in the case of a no-deal Brexit. She tells them:\u0026nbspYou are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay.\u0026nbspShe also tries to reassure the people of Northern Ireland, saying:\u0026nbspWe will do everything in our power to prevent a return to a hard border.Theresa May says keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union is unacceptable.\u0026nbspShe says the UK will lay out an alternative back-stop arrangement for the Northern Ireland border that will stick to her promise that there should be no new regulatory checks in the Irish Sea unless agreed by the Northern Ireland Assemby.\u0026nbspOf the EU she says:\u0026nbspWe cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs.\u0026nbspShe says she has treated the EU with nothing but respect and that the UK deserves the same.\u0026nbspMay says it is not acceptable for the EU to simply reject the UK\u0027s proposals without explanation or counter proposals. She says Brussels must explain what the real issues are and what the alternative is.May says there are two alternative to her Chequers plan.\u0026nbspOne - the EU\u0027s plan - would see the UK abide by all the EU rules and accept uncontrolled migration from the EU\u0026nbspThis, she says, would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago\u0026nbspShe says the other option would see Northern Ireland permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK.\u0026nbspShe says Parliament has unanimously rejected this idea and that it is something she will never agree to and no prime minister would ever agree to:\u0026nbspIf the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.May says she has always said negotiations would be tough and they were always bound to be toughtest in the final straitght.Here we go....We\u0027re now getting live footage from the room in Downing Street where Theresa May will speak, suggesting the power has been restored and the statement is imminent...The prime minister\u0027s statement is now 10 minutes late...The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/19/09/fur-ban-la.jpg","title":"la fur ban los angeles sale san francisco california","story":"Created with Sketch.Supporters hope action will encourage similar bans around globeClick to followThe Independent USThe proposed law is backed by animal activists, who say that the multimillion-dollar fur industry is rife with cruelty Los Angeles is taking steps to become the largest US city to ban the sale of new fur products.Following the lead of San Francisco and two smaller California municipalities, Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to direct the city attorney to draft legislation banning the manufacture and sale of fur clothing and accessories.“This is something that is not just a good legislative win, it’s a moral win,” councillor Bob Blumenfield said. “We feel like we’re evolving as a city, as people to stop this kind of unnecessary cruelty.”\u0026nbspThe draft bill\u0026nbspmust gain final approval by the council and then be signed by the mayor, Eric Garcetti, to be enacted.Supporters said they hoped adopting a fur ban in the nation’s second largest city, which is also one of the world’s major fashion centres, would encourage similar bans around the globe.“Los Angeles is one of the fashion capitals of the world, and if we can do it here, we can do it anywhere,” councillor\u0026nbspPaul Koretz, a sponsor of the measure, told a news conference before the vote. “We hope that New York City and Chicago and Miami are all watching.”Under the plan tentatively approved on Tuesday, a fur ban would go into effect in January and be phased in over two years, giving retailers until 2020 to sell off existing inventories. Used fur products would be exempt.The council is considering an exemption for products used for religious purposes, such as fur hats worn by Orthodox Jews,\u0026nbspas well as for items made from pelts legally taken under the authority of a California fur-trapping license.Major fashion companies, including Michael Kors, Armani and Gucci, have also moved away from using fur. Earlier this month, Burberry said it would stop selling real fur.\u0026nbspActivists have condemned the fur industry as inhumane, arguing that the animals are subject to brutal conditions and torturous deaths.However, Keith Kaplan, a spokesman for the Fur Information Council of America, said that while full-length coats of sable and mink may not be as popular as they once were, fur is still found in around 70 per cent of the world’s latest autumn fashion collections.“If consumers weren’t buying it, fashion houses wouldn’t be designing it, and manufacturers wouldn’t be making it,” he said.He also disputed as “bogus” claims by animal rights groups that the methods employed by the fur industry are inherently cruel and inhumane.Retail fur sales globally accounted for $35.8bn (£27.2bn), and the fur industry employed more than one\u0026nbspmillion people in 2014, the latest year figures were available from the industry, Mr Kaplan said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMPs to ban import of animal furResponding to news of the ban, Humane Society International (HSI) called on the British government to work towards making the UK the first country in the world to ban the sale of animal fur.Farming fur was made illegal in the UK in 2000, and EU law bans fur from domestic cats, dogs and hunted seals. However, Britain imports fur from other species including foxes and rabbits.Claire Bass, HSI UK’s executive director, said:\u0026nbsp“A cruel product like fur has no place in the City of Angels, and we applaud the Los Angeles City council for taking a moral stand.“Now it is time for the UK government to show equal compassion and listen to the vast majority of British people who want the UK to become the first country in the world to fully ban the sale of animal fur.“Our government has stated its ambition for the UK\u0026nbspto be ‘a world leader in animal welfare’, blazing a trail as the first country to outlaw the cruel and unnecessary fur trade would show that this ambition will be delivered with actions, not just words. The sale of cat, dog and seal fur is already banned here so now let’s finish the job and ban fur full stop.”Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/01/17/andres-manuel-lopez.jpg","title":"mexico presidentelect lopez obrador grounded flight luxury jet expenses","story":"Created with Sketch.‘I would be ashamed to have a luxury\u0026nbspplane\u0026nbspin a country with so much poverty,’ says left-wing leader\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent USPresident-elect was stuck for three hoursMexico’s president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u0026nbsphas vowed to uphold a promise to sell a luxury presidential jet, despite getting grounded on a commercial flight. \u0026nbspBad weather in Mexico City shut down the capital’s airport, forcing the recently-elected politician to wait on the tarmac with hundreds of other passengers for three hours.The left-wing populist\u0026nbsphas pledged to turn his presidential palace into a cultural centre\u0026nbspand sell the presidential plane costing $218m (£165m).\u0027Mariachi musician gunmen\u0027 kill four in Mexico City shootingAt least four people killed in New Mexico bus crashDonald Trump’s farcical deal with Mexico is a lesson for BrexitTunnel from Mexico to empty KFC restaurant found by US authorities“I’m not going to change my mind because of this, I won\u0027t get on the presidential plane,” Mr Lopez Obrador said while stuck on the commercial jet.The president-elect, who won by\u0026nbspa landslide in July, added: “I would be ashamed… to have a luxury airplane in a country with so much poverty.”The Boeing 787 Dreamliner – dubbed Mexico’s Air Force One – was commissioned by former president Felipe Calderón in 2012 and delivered in 2016.Running as the anti-establishment candidate, Mr Lopez Obrador repeatedly attacked the idea of public officials using\u0026nbsp“luxury airplanes” on the campaign trial.Last month the businessman Gustavo Jimenez Pons\u0026nbspoffered to buy the plane for $99m (£75m) and use it as a VIP air taxi.World news in picturesJapan\u0027s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe celebrates after the ruling liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership election at the party\u0027s headquarters in Tokyo on September 20, 2018. - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe won re-election as leader of his ruling party on September 20, setting him on course to become Japan\u0027s longest-serving premier and realise his dream of reforming the constitution.Los Angeles has moved to ban the sale of fur within its city limits.

Everything was ready, except a small but important detail: Jennyfer’s passport.It is now five months since Jennyfer Avero applied for her travel document. But, until today, the 23-year-old craftswoman from Caracas hasn’t heard a word about the state of her request.\u0026nbspLast month, her boyfriend Javier left to Ecuador and became part of one of the biggest exoduses in Latin American history. And in the mean while, Jennyfer continues to wait, hoping she will join him soon.“I have no alternative,” she says. “I wouldn’t like to leave without a passport.”Venezuela’s intensifying economic and political crisis has pushed thousands of hundreds to flee the country. They are in search of food, security, medicine and jobs.But not all that make the decision to leave have a valid passport. Venezuelans face multiple difficulties when trying to obtain this document. Some people can wait months, or even years to get it. The process can be complicated, expensive and sometimes illegal.Day after day crowds queue up outside the headquarters of the passport agency, known as Saime, in Caracas.Saime has more than 200 offices nationwide, however there are many people who come to the headquarters hoping to get a passport. Here the possibilities are greater, users say.Everyone is here – women, children, couples and elderly people. Some arrived before dawn, others, those who came from afar, spent the night there. Much of them share the desire to leave the country for good.This is the fourth time in three months I’ve come here, says Jose Di Marco, while standing in line.Di Marco travelled 713 km by bus from the town of Puerto Ordaz to Caracas. For the second consecutive day, the 20-year-old student has been sleeping at a nearby square to avoid losing his spot in the queue.He should be travelling to Ecuador at the end of this month. He has been awarded a full scholarship to study performing arts, but if he doesn’t arrive in time it will be taken away.Without answers about the status of his application, which he has been processing since 2016, he’s starting to feel desperate.I\u0027ve thought about leaving without a passport, I can’t waste more time, he says.AFPGetty Images)The passport system began to fail two years ago. In theory the process is easy. It’s done through a web page in which the citizen requests an appointment, attends the appointment and is given the passport within a couple of weeks. But often, users say, the website crashes and the appointment gets cancelled or people’s data just disappears from the system.It\u0027s as if I had never attended the appointment, says Delia Cabral, 52, whose data disappeared from the website after she went to her appointment.The accountant has been waiting since May for her passport. Her daughter is waiting for her in Spain.It\u0027s as if I had never attended the appointment\u0026nbspExperts say that Venezuela’s telecommunication infrastructure is one of the weakest within the region, which is why it is not surprising that high-traffic websites collapse.In July, a new head of Saime was named. He promised a complete renovation of the Saime website, as well as a profound restructuring of the organisation. However, the system still seems to be failing.The passport agency has blamed shortages of materials, like paper and plastic, for the delays.Venezuela has been suffering from shortages of food, medicines and other basic goods for many years now. The lack of passports is just one of them.The legal price of a passport in Venezuela is 18 bolivars, or $0.30 at the black market exchange rate. However, tired of waiting, some Venezuelans choose to pay for the service of officials who can speed up the process for $1,000, at the very least. A prohibitively expensive amount for most Venezuelans, taking into account that the monthly minimum wage is $18.Maduro urges Venezuelan migrants to return home from ‘economic slavery’ in other countriesThis is an illegal practice for which several Saime officials have been arrested in recent months. The institution also blames those members of the ‘mafia’ inside the passport agency for the delays.The economic and social crisis has become so unbearable that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans consider escaping the country to be their only option – a feeling that has only increased over the past few months.President Nicolas Maduro denies the existence of a migration crisis and blames his foes for inflating the numbers.The government typically does not publish data, but the UN estimates that 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, especially to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In August, the UN warned the migration exodus was reaching a \u0027crisis moment,\u0027 akin to the situation in Mediterranean.\u0026nbspLast month, Ecuador and Peru tightened their migration controls for Venezuelans, requiring them to show valid passports at the border. That decision left many Venezuelans travelling without passports in limbo.The measure was later overturned. Over recent weeks, 11 Latin American countries agreed to allow Venezuelans to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.While this is a relief for those who haven’t been able to renew their travel documents, nothing changes for those who have never had a passport, like Jennyfer.“It makes no difference for me,” she says “I’m still stuck in here.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/28/10/nawaz-sharif2.jpg","title":"nawaz sharif impeachment ex prime minister pakistan release suspended sentence","story":"Created with Sketch.Decision follows three-time prime minister\u0027s disqualification\u0026nbspfrom holding office by Supreme Court in July 2017Click to followThe IndependentOn Wednesday, the Islamabad High Court suspended the 10-year sentence for disgraced former prime minister Nawaz Sharif A Pakistani court has ordered the release of jailed former prime minister\u0026nbspNawaz\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspand his daughter, suspending the sentences they received from a lower court in July and prompting celebrations among supporters waiting outside.On\u0026nbspWednesday,\u0026nbspthe Islamabad High Court suspended the 10-year sentence for\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspand the seven-year term handed\u0026nbspto his daughter, Maryam, over corrupt practices linked to his family’s ownership of upscale London flats.“Justice has been served and I congratulate\u0026nbspNawaz\u0026nbspSharif‘s supporters,” former foreign minister Khawaja Asif, a staunch\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspally, said outside the courtroom where\u0026nbspSharif‘s supporters were seen celebrating wildly.The\u0026nbspSharifs’ convictions are still under appeal with the same Islamabad High Court.But a judge on Wednesday ruled they should be freed immediately while the case continues.Three-time prime minister\u0026nbspSharif\u0026nbspwas ousted and disqualified from holding office by the Supreme Court in July 2017 and jailed earlier this year in absentia.Supporters of Nawaz Sharif celebrate the suspension of his prison sentence in Lahore, Pakistan (AP)He was arrested on 13\u0026nbspJuly upon returning from London, where his wife was receiving treatment before her death this month.Sharif\u0026nbsphas repeatedly called the cases against him politically motivated, suggesting collusion between the powerful military and courts to destabilise his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz\u0026nbsp(PML-N) party and throw him out of power.World news in picturesLos Angeles has moved to ban the sale of fur within its city limits.

Dominic Raab REFUSES to rule out further concessions to EU                Dominic Raab blasts EU\u0027s \u0027computer says NO!\u0027 approach to Brexit talksHere, the EU is still only offering us two options.The first option would involve the UK staying in the European Economic Area and a customs union with the EU.In plain English, this would mean we\u0026rsquod still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn\u0026rsquot do the trade deals we want with other countries.That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago.The second option would be a basic free trade agreement for Great Britain that would introduce checks at the Great BritainEU border. But even worse, Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the Customs Union and parts of the Single Market, permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea.Parliament has already - unanimously - rejected this idea.Theresa May speech (Image: Getty)Creating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would not respect that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, in line with the principle of consent, as set out clearly in the BelfastGood Friday Agreement.It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake. Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively ides our country in two would be a bad deal and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal.But I have also been clear that the best outcome is for the UK to leave with a deal. That is why, following months of intensive work and detailed discussions, we proposed a third option for our future economic relationship, based on the frictionless trade in goods. That is the best way to protect jobs here and in the EU and to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern\u0026nbspIreland,\u0026nbspwhile respecting the referendum result and the integrity of the United Kingdom.Yesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn\u0026rsquot explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse.The second issue is connected to the first. We both agree that the Withdrawal Agreement needs to include a backstop to ensure that if there\u0026rsquos a delay in implementing our new relationship, there still won\u0026rsquot be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country.We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK. And it will be in line with the commitments we made back in December - including the commitment that no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other.We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs.We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens.Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side\u0026rsquos proposals without a detailed explanation and\u0026nbspcounter proposals.Theresa May speech: Mrs May said she expected the EU to treat the UK with respect (Image: Getty)So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress.In the meantime, we must and will continue the work of preparing ourselves for no deal.In particular, I want to clarify our approach to two issues.First, there are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday\u0026rsquos summit means for their future.I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay.Second, I want to reassure the people of Northern Ireland that in the event of no deal we will do everything in our power to prevent a return to a hard border.Let me also say this.The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy.That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU.I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.No one wants a good deal more than me.But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country.We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations. We stand ready.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remain closely tied to Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US — for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.But her plans were dealt a blow at crunch talks in Salzburg with other EU leaders in September.The PM was ambushed by EU bullies who dismissed her Chequers plan out of hand.Maltese and Czech leaders told Britain to hold a second referendum, employing the same tactic that the EU has used in Ireland and Denmark before.Once a deal has been agreed —  ever — MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of Hard Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.The former Foreign Secretary later claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis, Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000362629026.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"leo mckinstry opinion immigration multiculturalism debate","story":"Mass immigration is transforming the size and the nature of our population.Between 2001 and 2016, the number of people living in the UK increased by 6.6million to 65.7million. And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU has to know that she is unafraid to walk away  need be.What does her blundering Remainer Chancellor do?Volunteers his own apocalyptic warning about No Deal reversing our progress since the 2008 crash.Mr Hammond has leapt on the IMF’s latest doom-laden predictions and swallowed them whole, despite its abysmal forecasting record over the financial crisis, austerity and the Brexit vote.The Chancellor has already hampered vital No Deal preparations, undermined the new Brexit Secretary and only last week suggested delaying our departure.Now, at a stroke, he has sabotaged our negotiating hand and boosted the EU’s.It is a measure of the weakness of Mrs May’s position after the loss of her majority that Mr Hammond is still in his job.REMEMBER Brussels mocking the Brexiteers’ idea of high-tech customs checks to solve the Irish border problem?The technology didn’t exist, they said. It was a “fantasy island unicorn model”.Triumphant Remoaners piled in. It proved Brexiteers were clueless, they chirped. And Downing Street then ­produced its convoluted alternative.Except the EU, in the form of Michel Barnier, now believes in the fantasy island unicorn model too. The trouble being it wants it used between Britain and Northern Ireland instead of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.And the DUP, whom Theresa May needs for her survival, won’t wear that. Nor should they, since it ides the UK.Funny though, isn’t it, how Brussels move the goalposts when it suits them? They have negotiated in bad faith all along.TOO many politicians are in denial about the soaring cost of the NHS and social care. So we applaud Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s imaginative plan to sort the latter.The new lelong insurance system he is considering, compulsory for all workers unless they take a risk and opt out, looks a practical idea to fund part or all of an OAP’s care costs.It would give them peace of mind that they wouldn’t have to spend their savings or the proceeds from their home.Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Regardless, it is to Mr Hancock’s credit that he is starting a grown-up conversation at last over future funding of health.For too long progress has been stymied by the Left using any change to the NHS as a political weapon.But the structure of a health service designed in 1948 now needs a radical rethink.It is time reality dawned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And they’re right to be.As recently as 1991, a third of those aged 16 to 24 owned their own home.Now, that figure is ten per cent.For those aged 25 to 34, the rate has fallen from 66 per cent to 38 per cent.Home ownership rates in Britain are now the fourth lowest in the EU, and we have the second highest proportion of social housing, i.e., people living in homes provided by the State.Earlier this year, we at the Centre for Policy Studies commissioned polling asking young people how government could make their lives better.The top answer was clear — they want housing to be more affordable.And not via cheaper rents — by a three-to-one margin, they wanted the Government to prioritise home ownership.Strikingly, only three per cent of those aged 18 to 24 told us they never wanted to own their own home.They just can’t see themselves being able to afford it for years — often decades.This is a crisis with many causes.The persistent failure, stretching back decades, to build enough new homes. A dysal planning system.Existing homeowners who don’t want their communities disrupted or their views spoiled.A Labour government that made it much easier for buy-to-let landlords to snap up those homes that were being built, and much harder for first-time buyers to do the same — and a financial crash which made that problem so much worse. Yet it’s also a crisis with many solutions.Making it easier to extend or expand existing properties. Changing Green Belt regulations so we protect our most beautul countryside while building on pig farms, or beside railway stations or motorways or electricity substations or other decidedly non-green and unpleasant bits of land.Finding ways  to turn renters into owners, as Margaret Thatcher did with the Right to Buy for council tenants in the 1980s, with more than a little success.But the sad truth is that while the Government has succeeded in dragging up construction levels, it is still not thinking anywhere near radically enough.“Since my very first day in Downing Street, I have made it my personal mission to fix our broken housing system,” Theresa May told the National Housing Federation yesterday.But that mission is in grave jeopardy.A year ago, the Prime Minister endured a triple whammy of embarrassment in her party conference speech — being handed a P45 by a prankster, developing a crippling cough, then seeing the slogan behind her start to fall off.Mrs May bravely endured these trials. But she could do little about the fact that her promise in the same speech to “make the British dream a reality by igniting home ownership once again” was built around a £10billion expansion of the Help to Buy scheme.A scheme which pretty much every economist, including the Government’s own Office for Budget Responsibility, says is mostly serving to push up house prices and make colossally rich housebuilders even richer.Indeed, even as Mrs May was speaking, their collective share price spiked by £1BILLION.Yesterday, the Prime Minister ed to the subject.In a speech to the National Housing Summit, she promised another £2billion for social housing.But even on its own terms, Mrs May’s proposal isn’t a blunderbuss.It’s a pinprick. Not only is the £2billion spread over a decade but it’s a small fraction of the amount that George Osborne cut from the same budgets.And it fits a wider pattern. For all the Government’s rhetoric, the big ideas to get Britain building just aren’t there.One of the keys to David Cameron’s election victory in 2015 — right there on the first page of the Tory manesto — was a promise to extend the Right to Buy to housing associations and to build 200,000 starter homes.The commitment was to create two million more homeowners within five years.As of May 2018, not a single one of those starter homes had been built — and the expansion of Right to Buy is still lodged in the gullet of the Whitehall machine.It’s the same pattern on planning reform.Sajid Javid’s robust proposals as Communities Secretary to break up the oligopoly of the big housebuilders, free up more land and speed up development — all badly needed — were neutered by Downing Street, because it was paranoid about upsetting traditional Tory voters who don’t like the sight of bulldozers.When the Government’s new planning framework was announced in March, the headlines were about building more and higher-quality homes.But the small print made it so that councils could get away with building fewer houses, not more.I don’t doubt that Mrs May’s heart is in the right place.But  she and her team don’t pluck up their courage on housing — and take far more dramatic steps both to build more houses and create more homeowners — they’ll almost certainly lose the next election. More than that, they’ll deserve to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vexed issue. Complain about it and people will call you a racist.That’s a popular way of shutting down debate these days. Just screech “raaacisst” at someone.I’d go so far as to say it’s one of the reasons Leave won the referendum — because ordinary people were sick of being called racist when they simply worried about the millions of people who have arrived here in the past ten years.About seven million, in fact. An astonishing number.The Prime Minister is about to draw up her plans for immigration post-Brexit.She will be taking advice from the Migration Advisory Committee . It has suggested we allow in skilled workers who might be vital to our economy.It has also suggested we clamp down on low-skilled migrants.This seems to me a perfectly sensible argument. We should not entirely close ourselves off from the world. And there are foreign nationals here who do excellent work for our country. And pay good taxes.At the same time, the vast influx of low-skilled workers has had a terrible effect upon our country.Some towns — such as Boston in Lincolnshire — have been effectively taken over.And as the MAC found, the vast reservoir of labour has depressed the wages of British people at the lowest end of the scale. It has hurt the poorest of us.But it doesn’t only hurt us. You’ll have seen the squalid conditions in which a lot of these low-paid foreign workers live. This is exploitation, on a massive scale.How any leftie can support it absolutely befoggles me.Living below the minimum wage, crammed into rotten accommodation — all so companies such as Amazon can make a bigger profit.No wonder the big companies were the first to complain. Listen: Pay your workers a decent, living wage in future and shut up, huh?But this is an overcrowded country. It is ludicrous to suggest that the millions we have allowed in have not had a massive effect on our infrastructure.It’s why we need to pave over more and more of the countryside to build homes, for example. The MAC suggested house prices had risen as a consequence — and our homes already cost too much.There’s pressure on our schools, our hospitals and our transport networks.Well, with any luck this will all come to an end. Perhaps the Government might also abide by its pledge to get yearly immigration levels down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands as it is at the moment.But at the same time we should look after the EU migrants we have already let in, and ensure they feel secure and safe living in Britain.Do all that and I’ll be a happy man. Even  the lefties still shriek “raaacisst” every few seconds.GIRLS – looking for something to wear for a night out?

Yep, it’s the black bin liner, as sported here by Megan Barton Hanson.I have no idea, incidentally, who Megan Barton Hanson is, still less her boyfriend called “Wes”.BBC Radio 6 presenter Cerys Matthews says she refuses to play music made by people who went to private school.OK, Cerys. That means your entire back catalogue is banned, seeing as you were educated at the expensive St Michael’s School in Llanelli.A few weeks ago a BBC executive said he wouldn’t be commissioning comedies from public schoolboys .Spouting every right-on opinion that suddenly swings into fashion?Here’s a tip, Cerys. Play the best rock, folk and soul music you can find.The stuff that sounds the most interesting.You’ll find that auto- matically the private school musicians will be excluded anyway – including yourself.APPARENTLY President Trump’s penis closely resembles a toadstool.This is according to Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with Donald.The question is, though – what kind of toadstool?There are hundreds of thousands of species. Was it a fly agaric? That’s the one with a big red head covered in white spots. If so, Donald ought to get himself to a doctor.Or maybe it’s that one with a thin stalk and a big yellow head the size of a dinner plate.If so, Stormy had better get herself to a doctor.A “RELATIONSHIP expert” has warned us all about dodgy body language  we’re out on a date.Tracey Cox says we shouldn’t fidget, for a start. What, even  we’ve taken her to a ballet?Also, don’t wring your hands or sit in a slumped manner, and so on.Hmm. As a “relationship expert” I offer the following advice to blokes out on a first date in a restaurant.2. Don’t pass wind then waft the air saying “Mmmmm, Bisto!”3. When they bring the black pepper, don’t sneeze on her pasta.4. If you do sneeze on her pasta, stir it around a bit when she’s not looking.5. Don’t use a bread stick to excavate the contents of your ear.6. Don’t keep checking the football scores on your phone. And shouting loudly: “Lee Gregory! 85th minute! Get IN you f***er!”7. Don’t ask the lady at the next table  she’s up for a threesome.Follow that stuff and you can fidget away to your heart’s delight. You’ll be OK.THERE’S a crisis in our wildle. Some of our favourite species of birds or mammals are on the brink of extinction.The corn bunting, for example, and the hedgehog.As TV wildle campaigner Chris Packham rightly says, this is because we have paved over the countryside to build ever more homes.And because of the intensive farming methods – which have seen the eradication of farmland birds.Packham has drawn up a “People’s Manesto for Wildle” which includes stuff like twinning city schools with farms, so that kids grow up with an understanding of nature.There’s also a demo at Hyde Park in London on Saturday. I’ll be there. Don’t forget – as Joni Mitchell once sang, you don’t know what you’ve got ’til its gone.SO, it looks very much as  the old Irish border problem is going to be solved very quickly after all.We’re close to agreeing a deal with the European Union which will enable Northern Ireland to retain its “soft border”.The Remainers said it couldn’t be done. Totally impossible. But  we don’t want a hard border and the Irish don’t want a hard border – who is going to make us have one?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The annual ­target for new homes is 300,000 — and we doubt even that would lower prices enough for young people to afford to buy in London and the South East.In fairness, the total HAS risen to 217,000 a year, the most since 2007. But it’s still way short — and the Government’s remedies are woefully timid.Sajid Javid promised a huge shake-up when he ran housing. He was knocked back by the negativity from Philip Hammond’s Treasury. Then he moved on.We need to slash planning restrictions and defy obstructive NIMBYs. We need to stop the land-banking that sees developers hoard plots or release homes at a snail’s pace to keep prices high.We need more cash help for small builders. We should borrow billions, build affordable homes on public land and sell them at a profit for the Treasury.The Tories need to wake up or housing will sink them. Instead they are hyping up some footling new funding that only partly reverses a previous cut.It fools no one.WHY is the EU wasting time pressing for a border between Britain and Northern ­Ireland? It’s a non-starter.No Government could consider it. Especially not one entirely reliant on the votes of those most vehemently opposed to splitting up the UK, the DUP.This cannot be news to Brussels. They cannot believe Theresa May will surrender and collapse her Government.Why persist with it? The answer must be: to run down the clock — until, at the last minute, Mrs May agrees virtually anything to avoid a No Deal.Which is why Donald Tusk also still insists key areas of our wildly over-generous Chequers offer must be “reworked”.Mrs May has gone as far as she can. Two Cabinet figures have quit already.

Heres the latest.Fears about food shortages have been reported since the Brexit vote in 2016.Some say that Britain leaving the EU without a orce deal could drive up the cost of importing food from abroad.The UK produces around 60 per cent of our own food - and 30 per cent comes from the EU.Lorries queuing for customs checks at Britains ports could spoil a lot of the fresh fruit and veg brought in.And they say that curbing immigration could decimate the homegrown food industry which relies heavily on foreign workers.Seasonal fruit-and-veg pickers are often brought into the UK from abroad and many food factories hire from the EU.The Government have said they are carrying out business impact analysis on what would happen as a result of a No Deal.Much of this research is focusing on the food industry given its unique position in EU relations.Asked  the Government was stockpiling food, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said: It would be wrong to describe it as the government doing the stockpiling.Of course, the idea that we only get food imports into this country from one continent is not appropriate, but we will look at this issue in the round and make sure that there is adequate food supply.Storage would also be dficult as 90 per cent of Britains refrigerated warehouses are running at full capacity.But in terms of seasonal workers, the Government has put forward plans for a seasonal farm work visa.The plan is to allow a maximum of 2,500 migrants a year to work on UK farms for six months.The plan has been welcomed by the National Farmers’ Union , saying it was a “major victory” but it has come under fire from other areas due to the yearly cap.Industry estimates say the sector needs a 75,000-strong temporary migrant workforce.Brexit-backing MP John Redwood insisted that British farmers need not worry about finding seasonal workers after Brexit.Appearing on Victoria Derbyshire on September 20, the Tory MP told a fruit grower that Brexit will give him control over his workforce.He said: “Of course, you’ll have staff and we will control our own migration policies and they are already talking about a seasonal worker provision for exactly your kind of condition.“But it will be your government and it you will be able to persuade them of your needs and we will make our own decision.He added: “What’s wrong with taking back control and doing things in Britain’s interests, instead of the EU’s interest.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435461680.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bullied schoolboy bradley st john school llanelli headteacher","story":"Grieving Byron John believes his son, Bradley, would still be alive  more had been done to tackle the 14-year-olds bullies.He claims the teen was missing for an hour and ten minutes before his sister found him dead in cubicle at St John Lloyd Roman Catholic School in South Wales.The 53-year-old told the Mirror: Im very unhappy at the way the school has handled things both before Bradley died, on the day it happened and since.There was a failure to follow up our concerns and those of the healthcare professionals helping my son.I am asking for the heads resignation along with other teachers who let Bradley down.The heartbroken dad plans to hand in four letters of complaint to the school, while other parents carry out a peaceful protest at the school gates tomorrow.He added he is doing his best to support his daughter, who tragically found her brother dead last week.Carmarthenshire Council said it was aware of the protest and the familys concerns.Cllr Glynog Davies, Executive Board Member for Education and Childrens Services, told the newspaper: There is a formal investigation underway and therefore it is inappropriate to speculate on the circumstances leading to this tragic incident.Bradley was given first aid at the scene and rushed to a nearby hospital but sadly didnt recover.Police confirmed they were called over concerns for Bradleys welfare and said his death was not being treated as suspicious.His dad - a Master of the Carmarthenshire Hunt until fox hunting was banned in the UK - paid tribute to the accomplished horse rider.He said: We as a family are devastated to lose Bradley. He was such a charismatic, wonderful and dearly loved inidual.“He was an accomplished horse rider and founding member of the Three Counties Bloodhounds, who hunt the scent of a human runner.“Bradley was the absolute centre of our world.“We would like to thank everyone for their support at this horric time.

This lot are more Bugsy Malone than Al Capone.Yesterday the leaders of the undemocratic European Union showed their true colours.This isn’t some grand project, designed to bring the peoples of Europe together in one happy union. It’s a protection racket.But even before the Prime Minister had been the subject of calculated attempts to humiliate her, we saw just how detached from reality Europe’s leaders have become.Maltese and Czech leaders told Britain to hold a second referendum, employing the same tactic that the EU has used in Ireland and Denmark before.This isn’t based on the half-baked “democratic” argument clung to by never-were and past-it grandees at home, such as Andrew Adonis and Lord Heseltine.They just want us to be given the chance to vote the “right” way. Fat chance of that. Throughout this process, the European Union has shown time and time again why more than 17 million people voted to leave.They have refused to negotiate in good faith. They have refused to compromise, even while Britain has worked day-in, day-out to find agreement.They have insulted the Prime Minister, ignored their own citizens, and are willing to accept a massive economic hit for the sake of flexing their muscles.Like all good gangsters, they’re trying to rule by fear. That’s the only weapon in their arsenal on the Continent, where more and more voters are turning against an outfit that increasingly looks more at home in Sicily than Strasbourg.All they have is the chance to punish us, and prove to the rest of the continent that it isn’t worth leaving.The message they want to send? You won’t get away with it.Well, Mrs May is right to say that we’ve nothing to be scared of.Yes, it is without doubt that we need to pick up the pace on preparations for a clean-break Brexit.It is vital we show the European Union, who still seem to think we’ll roll over when it really matters, that we are ready for a new future free of their cold, dead hands.And despite no-marks such as Donald Tusk trolling the PM on Instagram, and the puffed-up pomposity of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar, we haven’t entirely given up hope that sensible forces within the EU might find their voice in the crucial months to come — and work with the UK, not against it.The Government should be all ears  Brussels makes us an offer that works for both sides.But after yesterday’s performance, we don’t hold out much hope.Brussels has made us an offer it thinks we can’t refuse.Today we join the Prime Minister in saying no.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

French president Emmanuel Macron also heaped on the pain.While dubbing Chequers “a good and brave step” at a compromise, he insisted it is still “not acceptable, especially on the economic side”. The broadsides mark the death of the PM’s two key free trading proposals – a common rule book on goods, and a close customs partnership.Mrs May also lashed out to brand the EU’s rejection as “tactics in these negotiations” as she warned: “I’ve always said these negotiations will be tough. Im negotiating and Im negotiating hard in the interest of the British people, and to deliver on what the British people voted for in the referendum.”But when asked by The Sun  she would dump Chequers, she refused to rule out the move, instead saying: “If there are concerns, let’s hear what they are”.The PM also pledged to unveil a fresh proposal to unblock the Irish border backstop soon, which is believed to be a regulatory border down the Irish sea that will see no need for a new customs border there.TORY MPs have accused EU chiefs of talking up hopes of a second referendum to delay Brexit.Leavers hit out after Maltese PM Joseph Muscat and Czech president Andrej Babis backed Remainer calls for a rerun.Muscat claimed support among the 27 other national bosses was “almost unanimous”. Former Cabinet minister Priti Patel hit back: “EU leaders are not on the side of the British people.” Fellow Tory Marcus Fysh added: “It’s wishful thinking . . . and it has been holding up progress on the talks.”Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron said Brexiteers who claimed the UK would thrive outside the EU were “liars”.Tory MP Stewart Jackson said the remarks show why Mr Macron has worse poll ratings than his predecessor, Francois Hollande.Mrs May had been expecting warm words from EU leaders to keep her compromise plan afloat. But Brussels sources said she alienated the 27 over dinner by being too aggressive in her demands, and by failing to think she could go above EU negotiator Michel Barnier’s head with the direct appeal to them the Austrian city.Downing Street claimed the public showdown was inevitable at some stage in the negotiation, as both sides try to call each other’s bluff to fold first.A No10 source: “We always knew this moment was going to come, where we looked each other hard in the eye. Just maybe not quite yet”.After the drubbing, Mrs May swtly faced calls to abandon Chequers at the Tories’ annual gathering in Birmingham to save her leadership.David Davis, who resigned as Brexit Secretary in protest at her new blueprint, said clinging on to her plan would only see her forced to make more concessions to the EU.Mr Davis told The Sun: “It is clear what the EU tactics are now. Parliament was very unlikely to support Chequers, it certainly will not allow more than Chequers. Now is the time for the Prime Minister to reset the negotiation and take Tusks March offer of a free trade plus deal.”Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg added: Chequers now has no supporters at all. I doubt even the Downing Street cat is any longer backing the Chequers plan.And Pro-EU Tory MPs also savaged her, but demanded a dferent antidote.Pro-EU former business minister Anna Soubry tweeted: “Having been nailed to its perch this #Chequers parrot is no more, it is bereft of le, it rests in peace, it is indeed an ex parrot. So let’s face #BrexitReality take the only responsible deal - Norway plus and put it all to @peoplesvote_ukEarlier hopes yesterday of a rebellion by some EU leaders against the Brussels hard line, lead by Hungary’s Victor Orban, swtly evaporated. Mr Orban insisted eurocrats are trying to “punish” the UK’s exit decision “and the British must suffer”. But even Mrs May’s close ally, Dutch PM Mark Rutte, chided her by saying the Netherlands have “made more preparations for a no deal than the UK”.Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite dubbed the negotiatons as at “ standstill”.Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis addedd: I feel sorry for the UK.In a logical world, you might think, dear rail passenger, that Chris Grayling, the Secretary Of State For Transport, is the man in charge.After all, he is the one who pops up on TV when there is good news to announce, such as the opening of a refurbished ­station or the introduction of new trains, but you would be wrong.Grayling refuses to take responsibility, recently telling a Parliamentary committee that “I don’t run the railways”. Yet his civil servants in the Department interfere with the railways all the time.They make decisions over what ­services should be run, the fares to be charged, what new trains should be bought and which private company should operate them.Prof Glaister’s report makes clear that Grayling was deeply involved in making the decision to go ahead with the timetable changes, even though the ­industry was not prepared for them.If Grayling was not in charge, then he should have made sure that someone else was — but failed to do so.It’s clear from the report no one has overall responsibility for the ­railways, and that’s why they are in such a mess.Prof Glaister’s report highlights the fact that the railways were simply not ready to cope with the wholesale ­timetable changes, which were focused around ­services through London on the Thameslink lines and across the North, and ­overall affected nearly half — 46 per cent — of trains on the whole network.The report shows that the railway ­simply could not cope. The changes brought the service to its knees, resulting in thousands of services being ­cancelled and countless others delayed.Many passengers in May were left standing at stations for hours as ­successive trains failed to turn up.On one branch line in the Lake District, services were cancelled entirely and temporarily replaced by a diesel-hauled heritage train — which proved to be more popular than the usual service, especially as it was free.The introduction of the timetable resulted in the worst performance of the railways in more than a decade, with one in eight trains running late during this period.The after-effects are still being felt today, with daily cancellations and delays, and it will be several months before things are back to normal.Prof Glaister does not mince his words and found every part of the industry wanting. Network Rail, which is responsible for drawing up the timetable, “did not take any action” back in the autumn when it was clear there would be trouble ­implementing the new schedules.Two train operators, Govia Thameslink and Northern, “were not sufficiently aware” of the problems and failed to inform passengers when disruption ­occurred, while the Department For Transport and the Office Of Rail And Road itself watched these events unfold without doing anything or questioning whether the introduction of the timetable should be postponed.The irony is that the timetable changes were introduced to increase the number of trains available to commuters.In ­particular, in the North, the opening of the new Ordsall Chord linking ­Manchester’s two main railway stations was designed to improve services in the region.However, because Network Rail failed to ensure that more platforms were built at the biggest station, Piccadilly, rather than improvements for local passengers the result has been longer delays and ­numerous cancellations.That is precisely the sort of lack of co-ordination which happens because ­British Rail was broken up on its privatisation in the 1990s into more than 100 companies. Passengers are paying the price for that mistake today.The biggest error was to separate the services, run by companies including ­Virgin and Arriva, from the infrastructure, which is in the hands of Network Rail , when, in fact, the railways run much better as a single entity.Ironically, the Prime Minister at the time, John Major, had wanted the railway to be sold off as just four or five large companies that ran services and were responsible for the tracks and stations, but he was overruled by the Treasury, which wanted competition between ­companies — something that has simply not happened.As a result of the timetable chaos and other recent problems on the railways, such as the failure of the East Coast franchise and overspending on ­electrication schemes by Network Rail, Grayling has launched an inquiry into the state of the railways.It is the fourth such inquiry in the past decade and the others have largely been ignored.This time there is an obvious and clear solution. Create an organisation ­independent of the duffers in Whitehall who keep on interfering with the railways, and make sure it is headed by a Fat ­Controller who has power to make ­decisions over the whole railway, ­including the timetable, investment plans and ­services.Inevitably, this will at first have to be a publicly-owned body, since Network Rail is currently owned by the Government.But to appease any Tories opposed to renationalisation, Grayling could say that eventually it might be privatised — though given the experience of the crisis-ridden past 20 years, that day may well be a long time off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no compromise or flexibility to be found on the EU side’.Mr Crabb added: It pushes us more into a position where we say the quicker we are out of this circus the better.Asked  he was no moving more towards to the hard-Brexit group the ERG, who want to ditch Chequers, he said: “We come away having seen what happened yesterday, having more sympathy for the kind of language that they’ve been speaking.”His thoughts were echoed by former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who said the EU leaders had “got personal”.Speaking to the  he said: “Monsieur Macron is not only out of order, hes completely wrong.“The EU is doing their classic case of trying to bully the UK in a iety of ways into taking a dferent position.”It comes after the French President described leaders of the Brexit campaign who told British voters it would be easy to get a deal after we left as liars.At the summit the European Commission tried to get Mrs May to accept a backstop proposal for Northern Ireland to remain within the EU customs area after Brexit.But the PM flatly rejected it, arguing this would draw a border down the Irish Sea, and today one of her Cabinet ministers said there are no changes on the table at the moment.Leave-backing Transport Secretary Chris Grayling insisted Britain is preparing hard for a no-deal Brexit, although he predicted a sensible agreement will be reached with Brussels.And another member of the Cabinet, James Brokenshire, has insisted its Chequers or no deal, calling it a “workable, credible deal to meet our ambitions”.The Housing Secretary told BBC Radio 4: The easy thing for the Prime Minister to do would be to go with one of those two options that are being proffered.EEA, which does not deliver on what the people voted for in the EU referendum on freedom of movement, or Canada, which would effectively break up the UK.”He added: “They have said that its about the integrity of the single market and we believe the Chequers deal responds to that, and its for the EU to engage with whats on the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the latest.Theresa May spoke from Downing Street at 2pm this afternoon to update the public on the ongoing Brexit negotiations.The scathing speech - in which she blasted EU leaders for not showing the UK respect - came in the wake of the rejection of her Chequers plans by EU leaders in Salzburg.European Council President Donald Tusk yesterday ripped up Mrs Mays blueprint for Brexit — saying it risked the integrity of the EU single market and the Northern Ireland border.Key EU leaders including Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron also said signicant progress was needed by the European Council summit on October 18  agreement on the UKs withdrawal deal was to be reached.But hitting back, the Prime Minister today said the UK has treated the EU with nothing but respect — and the UK expects the same.She added : A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.Mrs May admitted talks had reached an impasse over two main issues where the EU and UK remain a long way apart in their Brexit negotiations.The post-Brexit economic relationship between Britain and the EU and the impact on the Irish border have become the main sticking points.Mrs May concluded her statement by saying: “The EU should be clear, I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country.We need serious engagement in resolving the two big issues in the negotiations and we stand ready.”Mrs May did not resign and was not expected to.Earlier, she indicated that she will come forward shortly with new proposals on the thorny issue of the Irish border — which has emerged as the main obstacle to progress.Elsewhere, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab earlier vented his frustration over the Salzburg summit as he accused EU leaders of putting the handbrake on negotiations.Mr Raab, appearing on the BBCs Politics Live, said: Weve been rebuffed on our plans without any coherent explanation as to why, theres these sort of rather dogmatic pleas to the single market unity but our plans were very carefully crafted around that.He added: Were going to hold our nerve, stay calm and keep negotiating in good faith.Weve revved up the motor of these negotiations, Ive been out there a lot more frequently to get motoring, to make progress and the EU have just yanked up the handbrake and for the negotiations to go forward theyre going to have to take their hand off the handbrake.Mr Raab also criticised Donald Tusk for posting a picture on social media of himself offering the Prime Minister a cake with the caption sorry, no cherries.He said: I think some of the way that it was done, social media against the Prime Minister didnt feel like very statesman-like behaviour.The Brexit Secretary went on to praise Mrs May, telling the BBC that she was a very stoic, resilient character.He added: Theres a big question mark about whether the EU is really serious about the substance of these negotiations."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435732833.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\u0026quality=100\" alt=\"UKIP leader Gerard Batten speaks during the UKIP party conference in Birmingham\" width=\"960","title":"who gerard batten ukip leader birmingham conference manifesto radical populist","story":"Nigel Farage warned the party would face \u0026#8220total and utter marginalisation\u0026#8221  it moves to the far right.Gerard Batten is the tenth leader of the UK Independence Party.Batten, 64, from Essex, was one of the party\u0026#8217s founding members back in 1993.Before becoming UKIP\u0026#8217s first General Secretary, he worked as a salesman for British Telecom.The MP has been embroiled in a number of controversies, many of which circle around his views on Islam.Batten denied taking the party to the far right.During the party\u0026#8217s annual conference in Birmingham, Batten said Mr Farage should be \u0026#8220a little bit more careful about criticising me\u0026#8221.He recalled a time when Farage had shared platforms with right-wing German party Alternative fur Deutschland.Mr Batten was keen to use the two-day conference to present UKIP as a true populist alternative.Their interim manesto includes:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The devastating blow came this week at an EU summit in Salzburg - leaving Mrs May vulnerable to Brexiteers in her own party ahead of the Tory conference next month. She now has to rethink her plan for Brexit at the same time as avoiding a party revolt. Last night former Brexit secretary David Davis disclosed a rock-solid core of up to 40 Tory colleagues could vote against her plan when - well,  - it eventually comes to a vote in parliament. Here\u0027s what the Chequers plan is, why the EU rejected it, and what happens next.  What is the Chequers plan? Theresa May’s proposal for pulling Britain out of the EU with the least amount of chaos, economic harm and damage to the Conservative Party. Many in her own party hate it, the EU rejects it and it has been compared to the poll tax. It is dficult to see how even  Brussels backed it, the PM could force it through the Commons. Why does the EU reject it? Uncertainty over the future of the Northern Ireland border. This 310-mile invisible line through the countryside ides the Republic of Ireland from the six counties in the North. It also forms the only land frontier between the UK and EU. EU chiefs want to preserve the integrity of the union’s external borders. But no-one wants a  to border points and crossings which could risk the fragile peace enjoyed for 20 years following The Troubles.  What’s Britain’s plan? A “facilitated customs arrangement” would remove the need for “backstop” arrangements for the Irish border agreed in December. The plan would avoid a hard Irish border, but critics say it is unworkable and the technology needed does not yet exist. EU chiefs fear it would allow into the bloc products which do not comply with their rules or have paid tarfs. They believe goods imported into the UK from non-EU countries could dodge duties and red tape by being taken across the Irish border. What about other goods? Britain is accused of wanting to cherry pick parts of the single market, which is built on the four pillars of free movement of goods, services, labour and capital. Under Chequers, a UK-EU free trade area would be created with a “common rulebook” for industrial and agricultural goods. The UK proposal effectively means remaining in the single market for free movement of goods, but nothing else. Brussels’ rules say it is all or nothing.  Why is it called Chequers? The proposal was agreed by the entire Cabinet at the Prime Minister’s 16th Century country retreat in Buckinghamshire, Chequers. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary quit days later to oppose the plan. The mansion is meant to be a place of retreat for British PMs. But so far it has caused Theresa May nothing but trouble. What happens next? EU leaders meet on October 18 in Brussels in what will now be a high-stakes, make-or-break, crunch showdown. Tough negotiations will take place between the British and EU teams in the coming weeks as they try to thrash out a plan to avoid no-deal. The UK will come forward with fresh proposals for a “regulatory border” in the Irish Sea, compromising yet further. But the plan could be rejected by Brussels, Tory Brexiteers and the Democratic Unionist Party, which Theresa May relies on for her Commons majority. And Mrs May and her backers have already said no solution that is reached can draw a border down the Irish Sea. If there is clarity the final answer may not come in October. There could be a special Brexit summit in November to thrash out final dferences before it goes to a vote in Parliament. Depending on what happens, potential outcomes include crashing out without a deal, a second referendum and a general election. Strap in tight. The UK\u0027s current Brexit plan is based on a deal Theresa May drew up at Chequers, her country retreat, in July 2018. At the time it was seen as a major sht to soft Brexit - prompting hard-Leaver Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign. The \u0027Facilitated Customs Arrangement\u0027 is a bid to solve the biggest problem of Brexit - how to stop a hard border between Northern Ireland and either the EU, or the rest of the UK. It would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tarfs on the EU\u0027s behalf. Parliament would technically keep the right to block future rules. But Tory Brexiteers said this olive branch would useless in practice. They forced Theresa May to amend the plan to say the EU should collects tarfs on the UK\u0027s behalf. Mrs May insisted this didn\u0027t scupper her plan. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier disagreed, and has continued to suggest there will be a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Remainers and Labour have also opposed the Chequers plan, saying it leaves Britain half-in-half-out of the EU in the worst of all worlds.  With a November deadline to agree a deal with the EU looming, and the plan facing a vote in Parliament after that, the UK is now ramping up plans to leave in March 2019 with no deal."},{"url":null,"title":"second referendum only way out","story":"NewsopinionWhy a second referendum is the only way out of this Brexit mess... whatever Theresa May saysShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist11:56, 21 SEP 2018Newsopinion\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy and a betrayal of that trust, said Theresa May when asked  there should be a second Brexit referendum.  Read that quote once more. It\u0027s not a \u0027no\u0027, is it? It\u0027s a refusal to ask the same question twice, which would as many have said make it a neverendum we kept holding until getting the \u0027right\u0027 answer to keep the Illuminati happy.  And the reason for the wriggle room Theresa carefully left in her statement is that, increasingly, she is the last person in the country to insist that Brexit is all going swimmingly.  If you are one of the 17,410,742 people who voted to Leave it is now clear we\u0027ll have to Remain or sell Northern Ireland. If you are among the 16,141,241 who voted to Remain it is obvious the best we can hope for is a twinning agreement with disaster. And  you\u0027re one of the 12,922,659 who could vote but didn\u0027t, well done for washing your hands of it. Because it\u0027s a right cocking mess.  It turns out that everybody apart from the 1.8m people who live there forgot about Northern Ireland.  And we likewise forgot that those people, in a referendum, had already voted not to have a hard border with the Republic of Ireland next door. They\u0027re happy with a hedge, but not barbed wire.  This makes it particularly tricky to take back control of our borders, leave a customs union, check immigrants or set our own trade rules. We can do what we like at Dover, but not at Belfast. So, there goes sovereignty. And the only way to honour a democratic decision to leave the EU is to ignore the democratic decision of 1.8m British citizens to remain in the UK.   Coupled with this insoluble cube de Rubik is the fact that anyone tasked with sorting it out would need the conceptual mental capacity of Stephen Hawking, the zen-like calm of Mahatma Gandhi and the firmly-rooted principles of Nelson Mandela.  We gave the job to Theresa May. Twice.  She co-opted the Disgraced Liam Fox, David \u0027I\u0027m in the SAS, me!\u0027 Davis, whatever bits of Boris Johnson weren\u0027t betraying someone and a Michael Gove fleshsuit.  You don\u0027t have to be a psychic octopus to have spotted a cock-up coming. It was like giving the Large Hadron Collider to a gerbil.   A referendum aimed at settling the question has merely shown an answer to be more impossible. The only parties united on the topic of Brexit are the Lib Dems who are as electable as Tony Blair with a bad case of scrofula, and UKIP which has spent years pretending it\u0027s not racist only to choose a leader who\u0027s friends with Tommy Robinson and wants to legalise hate crime.   Project Fear has become Project Oh Dear, as the trade deals we were promised have not materalised, the fishing rights that were boasted of cause scallop wars, police confirm European arrest warrants will be void and even the headbangers on the backbenches are talking about building a Death Star to shelter in.  Nigel and Boris, who once cheerily declared what a wonderful world a post-Brexit Britain would be, are now backing away, admitting it\u0027s a disaster and pointing the finger at someone, anyone else. In particular, at Theresa.  It\u0027s her fault because she voted Remain. It\u0027s her fault because she\u0027s too cautious. It\u0027s her fault the EU won\u0027t agree.  Theresa had no option but to suggest we all just imagine there\u0027s a hard border, without actually imposing one. Now the wingnuts have woken up to the fact belief won\u0027t solve a migration crisis, and the sane majority have noticed the government is relying on magic to make the world a better place, it\u0027s hardly a wonder that half the popluation wants a second vote.  And it is increasingly obvious they\u0027re going to get one, for three reasons. 1. This is the first time in British democratic history that the manesto turned up 2 years after the vote 2. The best offer we\u0027ve made is one that all of the EU, most of the Tory party and a good part of the country can\u0027t accept 3. Politicians never take the blame   It\u0027s also more than likely that, whatever deal we do or don\u0027t agree with the EU, when inidual parliaments are asked to raty it there\u0027ll be quibbling across Europe and even in Westminster. The two year Article 50 deadline has damaged the economy already, and further delays and uncertainty will only make it worse.  The only choice available is whether to fudge a deal in people\u0027s best economic interests - a deal which would never uny the Tories, probably not get through Parliament, and most likely mean Remain in all but name while paying more than we do now - or throw it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place.  If there\u0027s one thing politicians don\u0027t like, it\u0027s blame. So they\u0027ll ask the electorate not the same question about whether to Leave or Remain, but whether to Leave with no deal or a bad deal. They won\u0027t want to add a Remain option for fear of losing a clear mandate, but they might and there also might be a move to spoil ballots in such numbers that Remain is the clear result. The Tories can\u0027t agree with themselves, the EU can\u0027t agree with Theresa, and the only thing any of them can agree on is that the people have the inalienable right to decide.  It\u0027s just a matter of time until everyone accepts it . And that\u0027s why Theresa left herself room to wriggle.

I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight. While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that - despite the progress we have made - there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart. The first is our economic relationship after we have left. Here, the EU is still only offering us two options. The first option would involve the UK staying in the European Economic Area and a customs union with the EU. In plain English, this would mean we\u0026#x2019d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn\u0026#x2019t do the trade deals we want with other countries. That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago.  The second option would be a basic free trade agreement for Great Britain that would introduce checks at the Great Britain/EU border. But even worse, Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the Customs Union and parts of the Single Market, permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea. Parliament has already - unanimously - rejected this idea. Creating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would not respect that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, in line with the principle of consent, as set out clearly in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake. Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively ides our country in two would be a bad deal and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal. But I have also been clear that the best outcome is for the UK to leave with a deal. That is why, following months of intensive work and detailed discussions, we proposed a third option for our future economic relationship, based on the frictionless trade in goods. That is the best way to protect jobs here and in the EU and to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, while respecting the referendum result and the integrity of the United Kingdom. Yesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn\u0026#x2019t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse. The second issue is connected to the first. We both agree that the Withdrawal Agreement needs to include a backstop to ensure that  there\u0026#x2019s a delay in implementing our new relationship, there still won\u0026#x2019t be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. But the EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union. As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country. We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK. And it will be in line with the commitments we made back in December - including the commitment that no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree. As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other. We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs. We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens. Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it. At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side\u0026#x2019s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals. So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress. In the meantime, we must and will continue the work of preparing ourselves for no deal. In particular, I want to clary our approach to two issues. First, there are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday\u0026#x2019s summit means for their future. I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay. Second, I want to reassure the people of Northern Ireland that in the event of no deal we will do everything in our power to prevent a  to a hard border. Let me also say this. The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy. That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU. I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible. No one wants a good deal more than me. But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations. We stand ready.\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\",You can monitor its progress here...\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\",https:www.mirror/news/politics/breaking-theresa-gives-defiant-brexit-13285377\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\", Mr Raab, appearing on the BBC\u0026#x2019s Politics Live, said: \u0026#x201CWe\u0026#x2019ve been rebuffed on our plans without any coherent explanation as to why, there\u0026#x2019s these sort of rather dogmatic pleas to the single market unity but our plans were very carefully crafted around that.\u0026#x201D He added: \u0026#x201CWe\u0026#x2019re going to hold our nerve, stay calm and keep negotiating in good faith. \u0026#x201CWe\u0026#x2019ve revved up the motor of these negotiations, I\u0026#x2019ve been out there a lot more frequently to get motoring, to make progress and the EU have just yanked up the handbrake and for the negotiations to go forward they\u0026#x2019re going to have to take their hand off the handbrake.\u0026#x201D Asked  he thought it was an ambush, Raab said \u0026#x201CI think it probably was.\u0026#x201D\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/theresa-brexit-statement-live-prime-13285119\",Donald Tusk declared her Chequers plan \u0026#x201Cwill not work\u0026#x201D.

In plain English, this would mean we\u0026#x2019d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn\u0026#x2019t do the trade deals we want with other countries. That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago.  The second option would be a basic free trade agreement for Great Britain that would introduce checks at the Great Britain/EU border. But even worse, Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the Customs Union and parts of the Single Market, permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea. Parliament has already - unanimously - rejected this idea. Creating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would not respect that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, in line with the principle of consent, as set out clearly in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake. Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively ides our country in two would be a bad deal and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal. But I have also been clear that the best outcome is for the UK to leave with a deal. That is why, following months of intensive work and detailed discussions, we proposed a third option for our future economic relationship, based on the frictionless trade in goods. That is the best way to protect jobs here and in the EU and to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, while respecting the referendum result and the integrity of the United Kingdom. Yesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn\u0026#x2019t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse. The second issue is connected to the first. We both agree that the Withdrawal Agreement needs to include a backstop to ensure that  there\u0026#x2019s a delay in implementing our new relationship, there still won\u0026#x2019t be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. But the EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union. As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country. We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK. And it will be in line with the commitments we made back in December - including the commitment that no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree. As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other. We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs. We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens. Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it. At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side\u0026#x2019s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals. So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress. In the meantime, we must and will continue the work of preparing ourselves for no deal. In particular, I want to clary our approach to two issues. First, there are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday\u0026#x2019s summit means for their future. I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay. Second, I want to reassure the people of Northern Ireland that in the event of no deal we will do everything in our power to prevent a  to a hard border. Let me also say this. The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy. That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU. I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible. No one wants a good deal more than me. But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations. We stand ready.14:26KEY EVENTPound plunges to lowest level in 2018The pound, in the aftermath of the Prime Minister\u0026#x2019s statement, has plunged to its lowest level against the Euro this year so far.You can monitor its progress here...14:21Mikey SmithRECAP: Theresa May gives defiant Brexit statement demanding the EU \u0027show us some respect\u0027Theresa May today launched a defiant fightback over Brexit with a statement accusing the EU of making a \u0026#x201Cfundamental mistake\u0026#x201D.The Prime Minister went on the attack after EU chiefs said her plan \u0026#x201Cwill not work\u0026#x201D, accusing them of trying to \u0026#x201Cbreak up our country\u0026#x201D and declaring: \u0026#x201CWe are at an impasse.\u0026#x201DStaring steely-eyed down the lens of a camera in Downing Street, Mrs May snapped in her seven-minute address: \u0026#x201CThroughout this process I have treated the EU with nothing but respect.

I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight.

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Sunday, with heavy rain and thunderstorms expected to hit. Gusts of 60mph could be possible and forecasters have said hail is likely.  According to BBC weather , there is a small chance of injuries and danger to le from flying debris amid the windy conditions.  Gusts could cause damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs or through falling trees and branches. There is also a small risk of power cuts, longer journey times, and cancellations to road, rail, air and ferry services.  No weather warning has been issued for Saturday.   Heavy rainfall and powerful gusts brought by Storm Bronagh are set to ease as the weather system moves into the North Sea, forecasters have said. Coming hot on the heels of Storm Ali, the second named storm of the year has caused travel misery and widespread disruption, with fallen trees and flooding blocking roads and rail routes. But forecasters said the impact of Bronagh is waning, and is mostly restricted to offshore areas in the North East.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge told the Press Association: We have got reasonably good weather conditions anticipated over the next few days, given that Storm Bronagh is now leaving our shores. It exited the North East last night and in the early hours of the morning into the North Sea, although the back end of the storm will still cause heavy winds in offshore areas in the North East. Its influence over the weather picture is waning, and in truth it is only really going to be impacting upon those offshore north-eastern areas.

Consultant anaesthetist Dr Julia Morch-Siddall had downed four-and-a-half cans of Stella Artois in her Land Rover Freelander as she battled a serious medical complaint and thoughts of suicide, a court heard. The doctor, who has done work for the World Health Organisation, was spotted veering out of control on the A1 where she hit barriers and broke the speed limit. After turning off the dual carriageway in Gateshead, a witness who had reported her to the police and followed her, tried to intervene. The 50-year-old, looking “glazed and vacant”, ignored the man’s pleas to stop, drove off, ran a red light then careered into oncoming traffic on the A692 near Sunniside. Coming the other way was IT consultant Wesley Hall in his VW Up.  He had no chance of avoiding a horric head-on crash and suffered multiple fractures to his feet which left him in a wheelchair for months. He is still in agony and unable to walk properly eight months on and facing up to the likelihood of lelong disability. Mr Hall, 36, of North Shields, was in court as Morch-Siddall was sentenced for causing serious injury by dangerous driving and said afterwards it was “disgraceful” she was not sent to prison. Speaking outside court, leaning on his walking stick, the dad-of-three, who has lost his job as a result of his injuries, said: “The sentence was disgraceful in my opinion. “I feel  it had been any other member of the public and not a doctor, she would have been facing jail time right now.” It was on January 30 this year that Morch-Siddall, of Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, was spotted driving erratically on the A1 by motorist James Kennedy. He was heading south past the  Centre when the Freelander swerved towards him then crossed in front of him then collided with a barrier. It then continued to “meander” before hitting the central reservation. Mr Kennedy called 999 to report what was happening and saw the Freelander moving between lanes and hitting the central reservation again.  The witness became so concerned at the manner of driving, which he said was in excess of the 50mph limit, he straddled the two lanes to prevent other vehicles overtaking him and potentially being struck by Morch-Siddall. She pulled off at Team Valley near Sainsbury’s, did a loop without indicating then joined the A1 north bound. The court heard she hit inside lane barriers a number of times before leaving the dual carriageway at Lobley Hill. At one point she stalled and Mr Kennedy, who had continued to follow her, got out and approached the Freelander, hoping to take the keys off her. However it was a keyless ignition. He then grabbed the driver by the top and said “Just stop”, but she didn’t. Emma Dowling, prosecuting, said: “She had a glazed and vacant look and started to drive forward again. “He continued to follow her, giving the police updates and they went towards Sunniside. “She went through a red light and Mr Kennedy then saw her car on the wrong side of the road and she failed to follow a bend in the road. “He could see a car coming in the opposite direction and it had nowhere to go. The vehicles collided head on. “The witness rushed to the driver’s door of the defendant’s vehicle. He had a hold of her until the police arrived as he formed the view she was trying to get away.” Mr Hall, who was in third gear and within the 30mph limit, was knocked unconscious by the force of the impact and when he came round he was in considerable pain.  Miss Dowling said: “The defendant was struggling with the police, they were trying to arrest her. “She refused a breath test and was abusive to ambulance staff at the scene. “Four empty cans of Stella Artois were in the car along with a half-empty can. Three more cans had not been opened.” When interviewed by police she said she was “profoundly sorry” and explained that she had a medical condition which she had struggled with and would “binge drink to cope with the pain” sometimes. Miss Dowling said: “She couldn’t remember anything about the journey because of the considerable amount of alcohol she had consumed.” Mr Hall suffered multiple fractures to both feet, including dislocated fractures near the base of his toes and has had operations. Miss Dowling said: “He describes the effect as catastrophic and le-changing.”  Morch-Siddall, of East Heddon, Heddon-on-the-Wall, admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen of breath. She was sentenced to 18 months suspended for 18 months with 80 hours of unpaid work, programme requirements and a three year driving ban. Judge Robert Adams said: “Your only explanation is you were trying to kill yourself at the time. “You stopped working when you realised the extent of your problems and have not worked since but you are now recommended to be fit to work again. “You had consumed a substantial amount of alcohol but your barrister says this was down to your medical condition and that this was not a deliberate act on your part. “It’s right to say there’s very signicant psychiatric mitigation. She was not in control of her actions.” Christopher Knox, defending, handed in glowing references from a number of doctors who spoke very highly of Morch-Siddall. Mr Knox said she had had “suicidal thoughts” and had considered driving into a “static object” to take her own le, but did not deliberately drive into Mr Hall’s car.

The heir to the throne has been marking the landmark with events throughout the year, but the big day itself is on November 14. As a royal he\u0027s obviously not going to have a quiet night in and a Colin the Caterpillar cake, and it seems his family are preparing lots of exciting things to make it extra special.  We Camilla is reportedly organising a very special birthday for him with all his nearest and dearest - except his son Prince Harry and daughter-in-law Meghan Markle .    According to Vanity Fair , she\u0027s planning a dinner at the palace on October 25, three weeks before his actual birthday.  A source said: It\u0027s going to be a very special night and Charles is very much looking forward to it. It will feature a programme of music, opera, ballet and Shakespearean drama. But Meghan and Harry have a very good excuse for missing the party as they\u0027ll actually be out of the country on their first overseas Royal Tour. The couple are visiting Australia and New Zealand for the 16-day tour, following in the footsteps of Harry\u0027s parents Prince Charles and Princess Diana who followed a similar route for their first official trip.  According to their official itinerary Harry and Meghan will be in Nadi, Fiji and Nuku\u0027alofa, Tonga on October 25. Meghan and Harry were very involved in a birthday celebration for Charles back in May, just days after their wedding, which may have been to make up for missing his other parties.  The Queen is also reportedly hosting a \u0027lavish\u0027 party for her eldest son on his actual birthday in the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace.    Invitations have already been sent out to hundreds of his closest friends and family, reports Mail Online .  The guest list is likely to include the close family, including Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and other relatives. And according to the Mail, Charles\u0027s dad Prince Philip could make a rare appearance at the celebrations.

Strong, gusty winds are expected to develop towards the Liverpool Bay area on Sunday morning, spreading eastwards across England during the afternoon. Gusts of 60mph could be possible and forecasters have said hail is likely.  No weather warning has been issued for Saturday.  But heavy rainfall and powerful gusts brought by Storm Bronagh are set to ease as the weather system moves into the North Sea, forecasters have said. Coming hot on the heels of Storm Ali, the second named storm of the year has caused travel misery and widespread disruption, with fallen trees and flooding blocking roads and rail routes. But forecasters said the impact of Bronagh is waning, and is mostly restricted to offshore areas in the North East.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge told the Press Association: We have got reasonably good weather conditions anticipated over the next few days, given that Storm Bronagh is now leaving our shores. It exited the North East last night and in the early hours of the morning into the North Sea, although the back end of the storm will still cause heavy winds in offshore areas in the North East. Its influence over the weather picture is waning, and in truth it is only really going to be impacting upon those offshore north-eastern areas.  Saturday is expected to bring rain moving from the South West into the South East and the Midlands as the day draws on. The Met Office says Saturday will be a fine, chilly start for many but rain will push steadily northeastwards across much of England and Wales. Forecasters say it will be drier and brighter elsewhere but with scattered showers in northern Scotland. On Sunday, wet and windy conditions will hit England and Wales. But Monday and Tuesday will be drier and brighter, with light winds - except for in the far north where showers may be seen.  At its worst, Bronagh brought heavy rain and showers as it swept across the country, with 78mph gusts recorded overnight in the Needles on the Isle of Wight. Parts of Wales were badly hit by the downpours, with Bala in Gwynedd and Capel Curig in Conwy recording 58.2mm and 58mm of rainfall respectively over a 12-hour period stretching from Thursday evening to Friday morning. In Cynghordy, Carmarthenshire, footage surfaced of a car floating along a fast-flowing river, in what police described as incredible weather conditions.

British beer lovers revealed the components for the perfect drinking experience and revealed that the ideal pint should be accompanied by a packet of crisps, a good catch up with your partner and mobile phone devices out of sight.  The perfect setting is a country pub, with a beer garden and it should take exactly 28 minutes to enjoy, the poll found.  The study of 2,000 Brits, commissioned by St Austell Brewery’s Proper Job IPA to mark Cask Ale Week, also found that 43 per cent of beer fans want to be on friendly terms with the bar staff and, in homage to the sitcom Cheers, 16 per cent want to go where everybody knows your name. More than six in ten beer aficionados feel strongly that great taste is a vital component to the perfect pint. Of those quizzed 65 per cent said the food you eat to accompany a beer was crucial to the enjoyment of the drink with crisps, curry, burgers and peanuts among the top pairings.  Yet 23 per cent of Brits said they hardly ever drink a faultless pint, with almost a third  claiming that the temperature is nearly always wrong.  Nearly three in ten  claim loud music always ruins their drinking experience and 38 per cent say that their pints are spoilt by being served in dirty glasses. Just over a quarter of Brits  complain that many pubs and bars offer a poor selection of beers and four in ten bemoan the cost of a pint.  A Proper Job spokesman said: “With our research we wanted to shine a light on what makes a perfect, proper pint. “At Proper Job we believe that everything should be proper, and for Cask Ale Week we wanted to find out what British beer aficionados say makes a proper pint. “Our research reveals that there are many important factors ranging from who you’re drinking it with, where you’re drinking it and at what time of the day. “Taste is key for the majority of beer lovers, and what you eat with your beer is also really important.  “We hope this study will help Brits enjoy a proper pint during Cask Ale Week.”  According to the research, 22 per cent of British adults think it’s become harder to get a decent pint in the last decade.

Beverley Dodds, once crowned Miss Merseyside, used to lather herself with the sticky mixture so she could get a \u0027teak\u0027 tan to show off her body. Obsessed with sunbeds, she would spend so much time under the \u0027blue light\u0027 in her bedroom that her dad would complain about electricity bills. But now, she covers up everywhere she goes, hiding the body that once won her beauty crowns, after fighting the effects of skin cancer for two decades. She is encouraging other women to ditch the sunbeds and use fake tan instead. Beverley, who has battled cancer for 22 years, said: “You only get one skin, they can’t put a new one on. You should really look after it.  The 55-year-old, originally from The Wirral, Merseyside, used to go on sunbeds all the time. It was the done thing, she said. I used to model for sunbeds and they asked  I wanted the \u0026pound80 fee or a \u0026pound150 sunbed and I said ‘Oh I’ll have the sunbed’ - that\u0027s how much I used them. “I used to have it over my bed me and my sister used to use it all the time. I remember my dad used to always go on about the electricity bills. “There’d be a blue light coming from my bedroom all the time -  I only knew then what I know now about how dangerous they are.”  She added: “I sunbathed as well, I was a bit of a tanorexic to be fair. “I had a perma tan, like a dark, teak colour which isn’t really a good look actually. Beverley, said there were little or no warnings about using sunbeds at the time. The only warning was that the sunbed had to be six inches from your face, she said. “I used to wear olive oil and vinegar or baby oil and coca-cola. Or we’d wear factor 2. “And  you went on holiday and didn’t come back with a tan, people would think, \u0027What is wrong with you?\u0027 It was just a dferent style back then.  I probably was a bit addicted to the sunbeds, because when you’d lose your tan, you’d think ‘Oh I’m really pale’. But when I look back at the pictures, I’m actually really dark. However, in 1996, Beverley developed a burning itch on her legs which was eventually diagnosed as a type of skin cancer. I got these really itchy patches on my legs, they were kind of raised and I thought ‘Oh, I’ve got eczema’. “I was scratching it so much it would bleed. I went to a specialist and he diagnosed me with Bowen’s disease - it’s like a pre-melanoma but it is a skin cancer. “I was treated for it but then in 2005, I had to have a skin graft on my leg and the operations are very invasive and they hurt a lot - it’s really painful. “They take a chunk [of skin] out of you to build you up like a patchwork quilt and the scarring is terrible - I just can’t show my legs now.  “I’m always in absolute agony, my feet take a lot of battering - it hurts to walk. Beverley, who now lives in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, with her partner Russell Hipkiss, regularly undergoes dferent treatments to stop the cancer from spreading which she says are \u0027incredibly painful\u0027. “At the moment I’m going through photodynamic therapy where they put acid on your skin and then ironically they put it under light and that blisters terribly, she explained. “It takes all your skin off. The scars on her legs have left her feeling self-conscious and “unattractive”. “My legs were always my nice feature and now they’re horrible and I have to cover them as much as possible,” Beverley said.  “It’s really upsetting to me because I used to love wearing a nice dress and now I feel embarrassed by my legs. “It does knock your confidence, I sometimes put make-up on to cover the marks  I do wear a dress but it doesn’t really work and is still looks horrible. “I always have to wear a plaster as well in case they start to bleed - it does take a toll. Thank God for jumpsuits, that’s all I’ll say.” She is now encouraging women to switch sunbeds for fake tan products. “If I hadn’t gone on the sunbeds, I’d have had perfect skin and this wouldn’t have happened, she said. “I never thought I’d get skin cancer, it never entered my mind.

Graham Benbow, 55, lost his temper and attempted to drive through an open barrier at Manchester Airport after being told he would have to pay \u0026pound3 for dropping off a passenger at a departures terminal. The official tried to stop him by standing against the barrier - but ended up on the bonnet of Benbow\u0027s Mazda 3 hatchback car and was carried along the road for several hundred yards, a court heard. During the manic ride, Benbow - a psychology teacher at one of Britain\u0027s top girl grammar schools - went over a roundabout before eventually stopping for police as he was about to join the M56 motorway. The unnamed airport official was uninjured in the incident but said he genuinely believed he could die from falling off the bonnet.  But Benbow walked free after a judge said that although it was no excuse for dangerous driving , he thinks the drop-off charges are a disgrace.    At Minshull Street Crown Court , Manchester, Benbow, of Stockton Heath, near Warrington faced up to two years in jail after he admitted dangerous driving.  But he wept as he was told he would get six months jail suspended for two years with Judge Bernard Lever saying he was 100% against  the new charges introduced by the airport last July. In sentencing the judge said: Although it is no excuse for dangerous driving, I think that it is an absolute disgrace that people cannot deliver people to airports without paying an extraordinary amount. I was dropping off my cousin at the airport on Sunday and I was warned by my sister that the airport charges had been introduced so I looked for a sign when I arrived - but  I did not know I might not have seen it. The airport already does make a lot of money and does not need to charge \u0026pound3 for people to drop people off. My sister warned me that by the time you have got to the front you are allowed just minutes or seconds and they start charging you more. I saw a troop of elderly people who had been dropped off away from the airport trying to avoid these unjust charges. These were not young joggers, they were elderly people who had to be dropped off some distance away from the airport.  He told Benbow: You are fortunate indeed that I have faced these facilities myself recently. Whilst I am 100% against your behaviour and losing self control, I am 100% against the airport behaving in this manner against people who have no or little choice at dropping their families at the airport in this way. I quite understand why you lost your rag and completely flipped in the way you did but judges have to uphold the regulations that authorities at the airport are entitled to up their levy from time to time. I have to make it clear to everyone that they must not lose their temper. That does not retract from the fact that this was very dangerous driving and what you did was very reckless and dangerous. The judge said Benbow has worked for many years at a highly well-known and respected school and in a reference from the school principal, it states that he has never missed a day off work and he makes himself available for non-work days to provide additional cover. According to the reference, Benbow has been devastated by this case and very much regrets what he has done.  The judge told him: You have made a very positive contribution to your teaching and work despite the ious dficulties you have faced with depression. But people must not lose their temper so that when the official comes along and tries to do their job, you make it very dficult for them. You drove your car in an opportunistic way when you were unable to get out without paying but the compliant got onto your bonnet. You were not driving at a great speed but it is wrong to drive along the with someone of the bonnet of your car. He was trying to call your bluff and you were trying to call his bluff and I expect you were both enraged at that time. The judge did say that he accepted what happened was out of character. The incident occurred last July 23, just 13 days after the charges were introduced by the airport which claimed it would ease growing congestion.  Benbow who works at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls was in the drop off area at the airport when he encountered the official who was explaining the new fees. Prosecutor Duncan Wilcock said: The complainant is a gentleman who is employed by the airport to explain the rules and to explain what steps should be taken with regards to the drop-off charges. On 23 July this year the defendant attended the airport to drop someone off. Staff said he immediately began shouting and said he was not going to pay as there were no clear signs saying that he should. The defendant reversed his vehicle as he was going to look at the signs but at that point but he noticed one of the barriers was open and began to race towards the barrier to get away with not paying. The staff member placed himself against the barrier to stop him from doing so but the defendant did not stop. The complainant got onto the bonnet of the car and was in fear of his safety.  He remained of the bonnet for several hundred yards while the defendant continued to drive. Staff from the airport saw what had taken place and sent information via radio to the police. He went over a roundabout and stopped just before the M65 motorway. He pulled into the side of the road but when the officer tells him to pull his keys from the ignition he tried to reverse away from the officer. In a statement the complainant said he feared for his le during this incident and genuinely thought that he could die from falling off the bonnet. He said the defendant was driving in a manic manner across the roundabout.

From branded pens to free food, you\u0027ll collect a lot of useless bits and bobs during your first few days on campus. But one university has come under fire for a freebie given out in their welcome packs this week.  Students and parents have slammed the University of Sussex and its Students\u0027 Union for a  sexist  beer mat given out to new students.    Made by toothbrush subscription service Brushbox , the beer mat was intended to promote dental hygiene but people couldn\u0027t help but notice it contains a rather rude message.  The item features a highly suggestive image of a woman with her mouth open, toothpaste dripping out of it. And a message on the reverse side reads: Whether you spit or swallow as part of your  daily oral regime, place your oral health on autopilot with Brushbox. Photos of the beer mat have been widely circulated and criticised on social media.   One person on Twitter said: Young woman is accepted to the University of Sussex and this is in her welcome bag. WTF. Do you have any respect for women? This is sexual harassment.  Another commented: Beer mats given to University of Sussex freshers condemned as ‘sexist’. Or in fact, f***ing appalling. Your uni student daughter is just a piece of fresh meat for the boys. A third wrote: Oh my goodness! What were you thinking? In what universe could this ever be seen as a good idea? Sexism is sexism even when it\u0027s \u0027a joke\u0027. Women deserve better than this. added a fourth.    Following the backlash an apology has been issued by the university. A spokesman for the University of Sussex Students’ Union said: We were very disappointed to find this promotional material in our Dig-in boxes, and will be reviewing whether to renew our contract with this supplier. A spokesman for the university added: We can absolutely see why this promotional material in our Students’ Union’s freshers packs has sparked such a strong reaction. We’re sure this discussion will continue and that our Students’ Union and other student unions will feed back the reaction to the company responsible.

She had hoped to use the EU summit in Salzburg to win approval for her controversial Brexit plans. It proved yet another miscalculation by a Prime Minister who has misread almost every step of the negotiation process. The flat rejection by the other EU leaders leaves Mrs May’s Chequers proposals at death’s door – and there is no shortage of Tory MPs willing to switch off the le-support machine. At a time when we need a leader with diplomatic clout, we have a diminished figure who is at the mercy of her own party.  The shambles in Salzburg leaves us without a coherent or plausible Brexit plan. This is a humiliating and disastrous position to be in as the talks enter the most crucial, final period. The PM appears unable to command any authority or come forward with a solution that satisfies her party, the country and the EU. At stake is our future prosperity, our jobs and our livelihoods. We need a Brexit deal that respects the referendum result, but also protects jobs, workers’ rights and business. If Mrs May cannot deliver such an outcome, she should stand aside for someone who can. Prisons reform The state of England’s jails is a stain on the nation. Drug abuse is re, violence out of control and officers face daily attacks. So it is not surprising the chief executive of the Prison and Probation Service, Michael Spurr, has been shown the door. But he should not be made the scapegoat.  The fault lies with Tory ministers who have cut the number of officers, starved the service of funds and handed contracts to incompetent private firms.

Rather than spending her time carrying out official duties, the Queen\u0027s granddaughter is a top equestrian and Olympian with a fairly normal family le. As she\u0027s not a working royal, she has more freedom and she\u0027s just appeared in an advertising campaign with her adorable three-month-old baby daughter.  Zara is the new ambassador for pushchair company iCandy and invited the team into her home to film an advert.   In the clip the mum-of-two takes baby Lena out for a walk in the countryside with their two dogs .    Zara, who is promoting the iCandy for Land Rover collaboration pushchair, said: I always use the best equipment in competing and it definitely applies for the children and having the best for the baby.  The iCandy for Land Rover works incredibly well for us and fits into our lestyle across all-terrains, it is light and accessible. It is a fantastic addition for our family.  It is so important to me and the family to be outside my job day-in-day-out is solely being outside, so for me having the family there makes it all the more doable with my iCandy for Land Rover pushchair. During the video Zara can be seen folding up the pushchair and putting it in the back of a Range Rover, before driving through the country.  Bradley Appel, iCandy joint CEO, said: It is so wonderful to have Zara as part of our iCandy family. Her sporting excellence as both a World Champion and Olympic medallist is a credit to Great Britain, but to see her achieve all this and go on to become a full-time mother too is the embodiment of the multi-dimensional modern working parent that we see in many of our customers across the globe.

If so, you might want to steer clear of Daniel Sloss\u0027 show - as it might lead to bit of an awkward moment or, worse still, the demise of your relationship. The Scottish comedian says a 20-minute joke in one of his shows has been responsible for more than 4,000 break-ups. His live stand-up routines have been streaming on Netflix since September 11 - yes, it only became available to view 10 days ago. In his show Jigsaw, the 28-year-old, from Fe, rubbishes the notion that everyone has a soulmate, saying the message society puts out is: If you are not with someone, you are broken. If you are not with someone, you are incomplete. If you are not with someone, you are not whole.  As a result, we are made to feel as though we need a partner to feel complete - meaning many settle and end up with the wrong person. “We’ll force this f***ing person into our lives because we’d much rather have something than nothing, he explains. The advice has struck a chord with people all over the world, who have been messaging Sloss to thank him for changing their lives.  One wrote: Hi Daniel! I am 23 years old  and I wanted to say you can add a orce from a 3 year emotional abusive marriage to your list. I just finished watching your show, and I was having doubts about whether or not I had made the right decision. However, the questions and situations you brought up confirmed that it\u0027s ok to say that I deserve better.  Another said: Guess you can add another to your list. Watched jigsaw and just wanted to say thank you. Certainly not the message I expected from a comedy special but the analogy has been stuck in my head ever since and you were right. People have even turned him into a meme.  Last week Daniel told the Daily Record : “The joke is 20 minutes long and was never intended to break couples up. It’s just a joyous effect of it. “It’s a love letter to single people, pointing out that most of the time being single is better than being in a relationship. “Turns out it resonates with people so much they’re dumping their s*** partners. “Before Netflix, the tally was 500. It’s now more than 2500 – and those are only the confirmed numbers, people who have messaged me. “I wouldn’t be shocked  it was four times higher.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bmw ploughs group screaming schoolchildren","story":"NewsBMW ploughs into group of screaming schoolchildren sending them flying in shock footageSome of the terried pupils are lted onto the bonnet of the white car as it crashes through the crowd in Rodepoort, Gauteng, South AfricaShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNeil Murphy15:21, 21 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/world-news/video/horrying-moment-bmw-driver-ploughs-13285536,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the terrying moment a BMW driver ploughs into a group of schoolchildren sending them flying before driving off.

Staff at the A\u0026ampE department of a medical centre in the south of the island are said to have called officers in after making the bizarre discovery. The unnamed woman, described as an expat, had sought help after suffering pain in her genital area which doctors diagnosed as an infection caused by the reptile. Island newspaper El Dia claimed she told police she had begun to feel odd after going out partying with a group of British friends a couple of days earlier - but had no idea how the tortoise ended up where it did.   Brit found with tortoise in vagina in Tenere \u0027may have been sexually assaulted after night out partying\u0027  The size of the reptile has not been revealed. Island papers - and respected Spanish dailies which have echoed the story - have named the medical centre she attended as El Mojon in the municipality of Arona in the south of the island. The facility, above the holiday resort of Los Cristianos, operates as a small hospital and is eventually expected to become the main southern Tenere state hospital. Police sources in Tenere confirmed the story was true and officers had been asked to speak to a British woman about the bizarre discovery.  No-one from the hospital was available for comment this afternoon although El Dia said health officials had declined to comment for data protection reasons. National Police in Tenere, reported to have been called in to question the woman over concern about how the animal had ended up in her private parts, could not be immediately reached. She is said to have gone to A\u0026ampE at El Mojon on Saturday. Spanish daily ABC reported: “A woman of British origin went to A\u0026ampE at El Mojon in Arona, Tenere, on Saturday because she felt pain in her private parts. “The duty doctors inspected her and saw that her discomfort was due to the fact that the woman, who lives on the island, had a dead turtle inside her vagina which had caused a serious infection.” In December last year doctors revealed the full list of baffling items found in vaginas. The most common was scented soap followed by a deodorant lid, a bottle cap and a penis ring with spikes on.

We have been forced to change the defence with Murdoch out with a knee injury.“In the first 20 minutes, with Rachid Bouhenna starting, maybe not everyone was comfortable.“Afterwards we grew into the game and I don’t think that we made any mistakes.”Excuses, perhaps, but valid ones? Probably. Further to his points, when King, Paul McMullan and Fyvie, in particular, came on United kicked into gear.Ahead of Saturday’s trip to Falkirk, for the first time in a few weeks, Csaba will have options to consider from a squad he has, for all his critics, united behind one cause.Stanton is expected back in training while the trio aforementioned will have played themselves into the gaffer’s thoughts.Arabs heading through on Saturday will be looking for three points after draws against Alloa and Morton in their last two league matches.And rightly so, to push themselves back into promotion contention they will have to pick up three points with more regularity.However, Csaba has defended their record so far which sees them lie in fth position – just three points behind leaders Inverness Caley Thistle, saying: “We have had four games in a row without losing – two wins and two draws – so psychologically the team are showing spirit which is good.“They  have stuck with us for three years, this is the third year in the Scottish Championship and I think, not just the fans, but everybody is hoping we can go up.“This is a normal reaction, I understand them but they also must understand that we are also human and are trying to do the best for the club.“The fans have to appreciate the work that has been put in, the season is just beginning and it is only five games.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7bd9b8dfe43.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo says fraser fyvie has all the right stuff","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo was delighted to welcome club captain Fraser Fyvie back to the fold on Saturday and believes he is just what they need to push on.The midfield man came off the bench on 73 minutes after recovering from a long-term knee injury and made a huge impact for the Terrors.With practically the last kick of the game Fyvie netted a terric half-volley to equalise after Morton had taken the lead through a Michael Tidser penalty on 11 minutes.It was not just the goal, but his overall play, which pleased Csaba.“I am happy to have him back, not just because he scored the goal, but he is a player who can create chances and shoot,” he said.“In the last 20 minutes he showed his experience and he knows what you have to do.“He comes on and in just 20 minutes he shoots three times. Two were very dangerous and the third was the goal.“Fraser is definitely a leader but we must be careful with him because he had two cruciate ligament problems so it has not been easy for him to handle this psychologically.”Ahead of Saturday’s trip to face bottom side Falkirk, Csaba has decisions to make in his midfield.After his dominant 20-minute display at Tannadice, Fyvie will be in contention to start and Csaba also revealed Sam Stanton is close.“It is good that he is making competition. Him and Sam Stanton must come back, hopefully, very quick. Maybe this week he will begin training,” he added.“He is also a creative midfielder who can score goals from the middle.“He scored a fantastic goal against Queen of the South.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united captain fraser fyvie set for first start at falkirk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United club captain Fraser Fyvie is set to make his first start of the season at Falkirk on Saturday after working his way back from serious injury.Fyvie had been out since injuring his knee in a 3-0 Championship home win over Livingston in December of last year.The 25-year-old midfielder has since undertaken a phased  to action, coming off the bench against Alloa in the Irn-Bru Cup earlier in the month and at home to Morton in the league last Saturday.In the latter match Fyvie struck a last-minute equaliser to salvage a point for the Terrors after replacing Adam Barton in the 1-1 draw.He continued his recovery on Tuesday – turning out from the start for Dundee United reserves in their 2-1 league defeat to Rangers at St Andrews.It is now hoped the former Aberdeen, Wigan and Hibs man can complete his comeback by leading the Terrors out at the Falkirk Stadium on Saturday afternoon.He could also be joined in the starting XI by a fellow-key man from last season – Billy King.King has also followed the same path back to the pitch as Fyvie – appearing late on against Alloa and Morton and starting in the Gers reserve clash.The 24-year-old is, perhaps, still a bit away from starting a game and the form of Fraser Aird and Yannick Loemba on the flanks does not help his cause.However, he looks likely to keep his place on the bench after bouncing back from troublesome and complicated knee problems that have dogged him for the early part of the season.The former Hearts, Rangers and Inverness man notched eight goals for the Tangerines last time out and is highly-rated by boss Csaba Laszlo.The  of both men to the first-team fold hands the gaffer a boost ahead of Saturday’s crucial clash with Ray MacKinnon’s Bairns side.And Csaba noted the importance of the game after recent disappointing results and displays in the league.He said: “It will soon become more heavy but I hope the fans understand the situation.“We have changed a lot of personnel and, OK, I appreciate always the fans are noisy but on Saturday everybody felt us losing two points.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba21f610daa3.jpg ","title":"i love the hair the costumes and the make up dundee woman shirene is loving strictly come prancing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo local people are taking the plunge as they prepare to put on their dancing shoes and go Strictly Come Prancing.Strictly Come Prancing – Dundee’s answer to the BBC TV hit show – is already shaping up to be the most talked-about charity event of the year.A dozen local couples will battle it out at a glitzy dance-off at the Apex Hotel in November in front of a panel of judges headed by celebrity style guru Gok Wan. Funds from the event will go to children’s charity Help for Kids.Grant James Mulholland, 34, from Broughty Ferry, and Shirene Smith, 48, from Charleston, were strangers before they were partnered up for the event.The glitz and glamour of the competition inspired financial director Shirene to sign up.She said: “I have been fascinated with the idea of a dancing competition for ages – it is on my bucket list.“I love the hair, the costumes and the make-up that comes with it.”Company director Grant decided to put his name forward for a good cause.He said: “I have done a lot for Help For Kids over the years.“I am terrible at dancing and I have no co-ordination but the children really need the funds.”The pair get on well, both having wanted to be partnered with someone they didn’t know in order to take the competition more seriously.Grant has been surprised at how much hard work is involved in creating a dance routine.He said: “Dancing is more strenuous than it looks and I take my hat off to anyone who does it professionally.”Shirene, who says her only experience of dancing is in the pub, is determined not to come last.Grant said: “I am quite competitive – I want to win.”Their friendship is blossoming and Grant said the pair are yet to fall out. He added: “Shirene is the one with the rhythm and the moves.”Shirene admitted that she was not nervous about the event until she realised they would be performing in front of 500 people, as well as Gok Wan.The pair have just got their routine together and have been taking time out of rehearsals to watch YouTube videos of professional dancers.Grant said: “We have really been going for it and practising for hours.”Shirene thinks her dancing skills will improve as the event draws closer and has already been thinking up ideas for future events.The glitzy event is being hosted by the Apex Hotel Marquee in Dundee.Kim Wilkinson, director of sales for Apex Hotels in Scotland, said the competition is unlike anything it has ever hosted before.She said: “We are really looking forward to it.“For the last two years our marquee has been up for 10 to 14 days, however Dundee is crying out for such a venue to host larger events and Strictly Come Prancing is just one of the fabulous large- scale events planned this winter.“It is also great that is it local ‘couples’ who will be hitting the dancefloor and we would love this to become a regular event on the Dundee calendar.”The company is especially delighted about fashionista, Gok Wan, taking to the stage.Kim said: “We’re absolutely delighted that Gok is ing to Dundee.“He held a fashion brunch club with us last year and he was great fun with all our guests, so warm and engaging.”The Apex Hotel also thinks the event is helping an “amazing” cause.Kim added: “This is particularly poignant at this time of year when we look forward to the festive season, and being with our own families is at forefront of our minds.“We are reminded that we can all make a dference by supporting the wonderful work that Help for Kids offers.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba21ff335f84.jpg ","title":"jennifer and peter didnt like each other when they met aged 11 now they are newleyweds","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThey maybe didn’t like each other when they met at the age of 11, but now Jenner and Peter Stewart are newlyweds.They met as youngsters when they swam for Scotland, but it took a training camp in South Africa when Jenner was in sixth year and Peter in his first year of university to realise that they did like each other after all.Jenner, 25, said: “We didn’t like each other at all when we were younger.“It wasn’t until I started the same university in Stirling and we both joined the swimming team that Peter asked me out.“I remember we went to the cinema to see American Pie: The Reunion, which is funny considering it really was a reunion.”The pair have been together ever since, embarking on trips to Amsterdam, Paris and Budapest.Four years after their first date they took a trip to the Dominican Republic in June 2016.During a romantic walk Peter, 26, seemingly innocently asked passers by to take an image of the couple on the beach at sunset.It was then that the postman got down on one knee, with the moment captured by the strangers.Jenner, a primary school teacher, said: “I definitely hoped I would get engaged on holiday. I had given a few hints.“Unknown to me, before we left Peter asked my dad’s permission, which was lovely.“The couple who took the pictures on holiday were so happy to have been a part of the proposal, and he couldn’t have done it in a better place or at a better time as two days later he got kidney stones so there was no chance he would have been able to propose.”Just four months after the engagement the date was set for July 21 this year at Gean House in Alloa.What should have been a chilled morning getting excited for the nuptials turned into near disaster as an unnamed bridesmaid accidentally spilled orange juice down the crisp white bridal gown.Jenner said: “I am such an emotional person and kept crying at the mere mention of weddings up until the morning. I really mean it, I was an emotional wreck.“On the morning I was totally cool and then the orange juice was spilled. I wouldn’t let my mum in my room – my bridesmaids and I were just dabbing the dress with water trying to get it out. Eventually we did and I let my mum back in.“My bridesmaid was almost in tears she felt so guilty.“During the day when I told people about the incident and I tried to find the spot I couldn’t find the stain,so it actually worked out fine.”As Jenner walked down the aisle with dad Glen Dobson the groom did what every bride wants to see – he cried.Jenner said: “As soon as I saw him tearing up I had to give him a kiss, even though you’re not meant to.”The humanist ceremony went almost perfectly, although Peter did have a minor hiccup when he dropped the rings. However, the laid back atmosphere helped the guests laugh the mishap off.The wedding party released dark purple and lilac balloons while the newlyweds released two single white balloons.Following the speeches, which Jenner described as “funny, yet so nice”, the pair swayed on the dancefloor to Jason Mraz, I Won’t Give Up, which has always been their favourite song, before dancing the night away with their guests.Photographer Rebecca Lee captured the day beautully, and Jenner says they can’t stop looking at the pictures.Jenner was an only child, and her mum Kathryn Dobson said: “It was the second best day of my le, with the first the day that Jenner was born.”Jenner added: “I honestly wouldn’t change a thing. It was a fairytale from start to finish, I wouldn’t even change the orange juice incident.”The bride and groom would like to thank both sets of family and friends for a “better than amazing day” and would like to thank Peter’s mum Morag for planting two gean trees as their very thoughtful wedding present.Not bad for two 11-year-olds who didn’t like each other.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"motorists told to avoid busy local street due to emergency gas issue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPolice have urged people to avoid a busy street in the local area due to emergency gas works.Officers have been forced to close off Castle Street in Forfar due to the incident.Motorists have been advised to use other routes.A short Police Scotland statement read: “Castle Street in Forfar is currently closed due to gas mains issue.

I did win the ball but on the follow-through there is always going to be contact.“We have watched it back and I am actually pulling my leg away as soon as I touched the ball to try to minimise the

supporters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United defender Rachid Bouhenna insists they must repay the fans for their support with a win at Falkirk on Saturday.The French-Algerian centre-back made his United debut in their disappointing 1-1 draw with Morton at Tannadice at the weekend.The Terrors now travel west for a crucial Championship tie after captain Fraser Fyvie, ing from a long-term injury off the bench, salvaged a point with a last-minute strike against Jonatan Johansson’s side – who took an early lead through a Michael Tidser penalty.And Bouhenna says they will do everything they can to pick up three points and get the Arabs back onside ahead of, what he insists is, a continued promotion push.“Of course for Dundee United the objective is to go to the top league, the Premiership, so we have to win these games at home and get results away,” he said.“Saturday we lost two points, we need to win the supporters back this weekend at Falkirk and I hope next year we will play in the top tier.“The fans were amazing, we need them for the rest of the season and I think they are behind us.“After the game I thought it was a good game but we had many chances to score and didn’t take them.“It’s good to come back to draw but for the next game we have to win  we want to stay near the top of the Championship.”Despite hauling down Gregor Buchanan for the penalty which Tidser converted to give the Ton the lead on 11 minutes, Bouhenna was pleased with his first run-out in tangerine.However, The 27-year-old was not happy with referee Colin Steven’s call to award the spot-kick after the tussle with Buchanan at a corner and Bouhenna expressed his surprise given the physical nature of Scottish football.He added: “It was an OK debut I think.“Only really the foul for the penalty – I can’t believe it.“I don’t think it was, he did not have the ball and we are in a duel but I don’t know why.“It was not just the penalty, it was every ball the referee whistle against us.“It is not like Algeria or France, for sure.“It is more physical but Morton was a very physical game – that is the big dference and I think we can play more football at home.“Away it will be very dficult, you saw in the last game at Alloa you can’t play because of a dficult pitch but at home we have to play more.“Next game it will be very dficult when we play against Falkirk, so we have to get used to this.”Bouhenna is still settling into le in Dundee and getting to grips with the language – not to mention the accent.However, he still feels at home after being welcomed by everyone at the club.Skipper Fyvie, in particular, impressed the big defender with his influence on the side when he entered the fray on 73 minutes.The 25-year-old changed the game and got the equaliser with a ferocious half volley in second-half stoppage time.“Fraser has the experience, when he come on to pitch he helped us.“He is good for us and I hope in the next game he can continue to help us  he is in the starting XI or comes on to the pitch.“I am enjoying being at Dundee United, I am feeling very good.“My team-mates and everybody at the club have been very nice, they feel like family and I am very happy with it.“With the manager and the team-mates it is very good but we have to keep going, keep working and think about the next game.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Sbro_3D_Festival_PIT_Kyle-Falconer_Performance-31.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"the view frontman kyle

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Friday 21 Sep 2018

march","story":"\u0026nbspA GAY pride march in Inverness could get the green light as early as this week.The planned Proud Ness parade, which is expected to take place in Inverness on October 6, has been overshadowed by a row between religious objectors and counter petitions.The row erupted last week, shortly after Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , submitted a petition of around 600 to 700 names opposing what he deemed the \"unsavoury event\".The move sparked a furious response from other sections of the community, with three separate petitions launched supporting the Gay Pride march. They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Friday 21 Sep 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

However, the Dons will still have six players out injured.McInnes said: “Wilson will come back and Devlin is available.“Young Lewis Ferguson has seen a specialist and as expected there is nothing too sinister going on.“It is just a case of trying to settle the knee down after getting a bang on it.“Unfortunately it is not going to heal in time for Saturday but hopefully he will be back before too long.“We hoped Frank Ross  would be back training on Thursday but he is still feeling it a little from the work he has put in with the physios this week.“So we will need to stand him down for Saturday.“Scott Wright  is working away fine and as scheduled probably won’t be back until after the next international break.“There are also the three longer term ones of Mark Reynolds , Greg Tansey

repossessed.Aberdeenshire councillor Sebastian Leslie’s home, Lickleyhead Castle, which is thought to have been built in 1560, has been repossessed – with the family ordered to leave the premises.Mr Leslie, who sits as an Aligned Independent councillor, was suspended by the Scottish Conservative party until next year over unpaid council tax.His daughter, Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, lived at the castle, which is near Insch, as a child.A decree for the repossession of the castle, which is also listed on rental site Airbnb where it is described as “quirky and fun”, was granted during a civil hearing at Aberdeen Sherf Court yesterday.Court documents revealed the pursuer in the case, Together Commercial Finance Limited, asked the court to find Mr Leslie in default for failing to comply with calling-up notices – a legal document ending a mortgage agreement, requiring repayment of all of the outstanding loan.The court was asked to rule that the firm has the right to enter into possession and sell Lickleyhead Castle, which has been a popular spot for weddings, as well as the Gardeners or Gamekeepers Cottage and land at Premnay, Insch.The court was also asked to agree that Mr Leslie, his family and anyone else occupying the castle should leave it, and to allow officers of the court to eject the occupants and their goods.The decree was granted by Sherf Andrew Miller. Mr Leslie was not present for the hearing but submitted an email confirming there was no objection.It comes after the councillor was also due to appear at the civil court last week for a time-to-pay hearing.The West Garioch councillor was not present and Sherf Morag McLaughlin granted a decree ordering him to pay £4,214.50 plus interest and expenses to a chartered surveyor.Court documents prepared by John Fraser, the claimant, stated £500 had been paid towards the total bill of £4,714.50 for inspections carried out and reports prepared on Mr Leslie’s properties.The property was put on the market in 2013 for £1.3 million.At the time, selling agents said the Leslies lived in another nearby castle but used Lickleyhead for weddings and s, and put the property on the market because it was “surplus to their requirements”.It has passed through a succession of owners including Patrick Duff, the uncle of the Earl of Fe.Former governor of Mexico City Don Guillermo de Landa y Escandon bought the property in 1922 for his daughter Maria Luz, who married into the Arbuthnot-Leslie family.The court hearings follow Mr Leslie’s suspension by the Scottish Conservative party until next year, and it is understood his case will be reviewed in June 2019. Mr Leslie is understood to owe the local authority £2,500 in unpaid council taxes. Earlier this year, he said he was trying to highlight what he described as corruption in the Scottish banking system.The Evening Express made repeated attempts to contact Mr Leslie for comment but received no response.

We were close a few years ago when we had a replay against Arbroath .“The draw was done on the Saturday after the first game and the winner would have played Celtic.“That’s what you’re always aiming for, to play one of the top Premiership teams.“You want to get to the fourth round. That’s the aim of being in the Scottish Cup because you’re a Highland League club and you’re not going to win it.“But  you can get a glamour tie, that’s your final.“Father time catches up with everyone but I’m doing OK to keep going at 37.“I’ve always been hopeful of trying to play Aberdeen, Rangers or Celtic – they are the three everyone wants to play in the Scottish Cup.“If you can get that then brilliant – look at Fraserburgh last year with Rangers. The guys will savour that for the rest of their careers.“They’ll always have that to remember, playing against one of Scotland’s top teams.“We’ve had a little bit of that with Motherwell and Ross County and it would be great to have another big game.“But we’re under no illusions, we’ll need to be at our best to get past Fraserburgh.”For Fraserburgh the Scottish Cup memories are fresh.Last season they reached the fourth round and played Rangers at a packed Bellslea.While that gives the Broch confidence, captain Ryan Christie is hoping for another run in the competition this season.He said: “We keep looking back to that, we maybe shouldn’t too much, but it reminds everybody that a couple of games and you can end up with that.“But that goes for every team at this level – a couple of wins and you are in with the big boys.“We take notice of that, but we have to concentrate on Locos and trying to get past them. Our cup record does give us confidence.“We always set goals at the start of the season and one of them is to stay in the cups as long as we can.“The chairman never puts pressure on the management team or the players at all.“But he does ask  possible  we can get a decent run in the Scottish Cup because it brings some finance into the club.“We can’t keep looking back to the Rangers game so now’s the time to try to make more memories.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a leline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car.

There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

The handicaps are as tricky as juggling with hedgehogs  The novices keep you on your toes while the listed and the Group races have you tearing your hair out with the temptation to rip into the jolly regardless. Mind you, with just two favourites since 1980 winning the big race, perhaps we should be more confident. The Ayr Gold Cup is run over six furlongs and is open to horses aged three years or older with a maximum field size of 25. For those who like to follow trainers Richard Fahey and Andrew Balding have an excellent record in the race. They have, however, some way to go to match Yorkshire-based Irish man Kevin Ryan who has saddled four winners in the last 10 years. The pick of his entries  is MAJOR JUMBO 16/1. He comes good in September and the fast finishing second to KIMBERELLA last time out in a listed race at Chester is decent form. The current favourite has been punted hard having started the week at 8/1, and SON OF REST is now as short as 5s.  He put up his best performance yet when beaten a 1/2  by HAVANA GREY on Sunday at the Curragh. There is no guarantee that just six days on he can repeat the feat. I’m against him. Second favourite GROWL , in his career to date, has done all his winning earlier in the season and while soft ground would not be a hindrance most of his winning has come on faster turf. He’s not for me. Horses aged between four and fivr have an excellent record, but fillies and mares have yet to land a blow in the previous 16 renewals. The average winning starting price in that time was 15/1. Be bold, be brave you might say. A high draw is a bonus for this cavalry charge and with our selection MAJOR JUMBO drawn in stall 9 it should certainly not hinder this front runners chances. With 22 races under his belt, the horse has won five and been placed in 12 of the others. Those victories have come in a lower grade but MAJOR JUMBO 16/1 has acquitted himself well in Class 2 company. Apprentice jockey Finley Marsh claims a valuable 5lbs and though he is having only his second ride for trainer Ryan he is no stranger to the winners enclosure.

McCall admitted: “People are giving me credit for some kind of masterful team talk. “But the reality is our fans were dferent class and played a huge part in getting us back into that game. “At times it felt like the Somerset Road End was pulling the ball into the net. “That’s what makes this such a dficult place for opposition teams to come and we need to make the most of it. “I honestly don’t think our fans realise just how important they are to the team. “Saturday was proof of the key part they can play so let’s hope there’s a lot more to come.” United boast a 100 per cent record on home turf this season and McCall is determined that Somerset will become a fortress again. He said: “You look at the league and would maybe say Ross County have that class edge because of the money they’ve spent. “They have a Premier League squad. “But as for everyone else...there’s no reason why we can’t hold our own.  “Nobody is going to get an easy game at our place and we’re proving we can live with the other sides in this ision. “Had we kept 11 men on the park at Inverness we’d have won there and would be sitting top of the league right now. “So we know  we play at our best we’re a match for anyone.” Ayr will head for old rivals Alloa tomorrow knowing they have a chance to hit top spot should results go their way.

sphere lamp now glows above the architecture of Robert Adam, the interiors of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and glassware of Christopher Dresser, as well as artwork from the Beano cartoonist David Law, early computer games and even a pair of Hunter wellington boots.\nThe 55-year-old former Galashiels Academy pupil is delighted to have been included in the collective story of great Scottish designs.\nNeil told the Border : \"This is such a great honour.\n\"The people from the V\u0026ampA contacted me about six months ago and they wanted to me to supply all the background to how the lamp was designed.\n\"It is suspended right in the middle of the new permanent gallery - and from the time I\u0027ve spent here in the gallery it is getting a lot of attention.\n\"This is a most impressive building and I\u0027m pleased to be part of it.\"\nNeil graduated from Napier University in 1985 with a degree in Industrial Design after his schooling in Clovenfords and Galashiels.\nHe celebrated by collecting the Product Designer of the Year Medal from the SIAD Chartered Society of Designers.\nThree years later Neil gained his Masters degree in design at the Domus Academy in Milan.\nAfter relocating to Paris in 1991, he began to specialise in the design of \u0027deceptively simple-looking mass-produced objects\u0027.\nAnd there has been a steady flow of awards for his technology and lighting designs ever since.\nNeil\u0027s Scopas light, which was designed for Italian manufacturer Artemide, has already won awards in Europe and the USA.\nThe apparently incomplete suspension lamp is ever changing in its appearance, depending from where it is viewed.\nAnd it breaks the mould of monotonous forms that normally characterise this kind of central lamp.\nAs well as hanging in the new V\u0026ampA Museum, an interactive screen next to the exhibit allows visitors to deconstruct the Scopas design.\nNeil added: \"The virtual screen allows people to take the lamp to bits and then rebuild it on the screen.\n\"There have been schoolchildren taking my lamp to bits for most of the morning, which has been fun to watch.\"\nAs well as Neil\u0027s Scopas Lamp, the Scottish Design Galleries features a wide range of furniture, textiles, metalwork and ceramics, to fashion, architecture, engineering and digital design.\nJoanna Norman, Lead Curator of the Scottish Design Galleries, told us: \"The influence of Scottish design is not limited to one country, it has been felt around the world .\n\"Drawing on the V\u0026ampA\u0026rsquos world-famous collections of art, design and performance, it has taken several years of careful research to establish this unique collection of objects which together will tell a fascinating and relatively unknown story.\nAfter attending the

very best of what the Scottish Borders has to serve up.\nBetween a food fayre, chef demonstrations and charity dinner, there was something for everyone to appreciate across the Local Food on Local Plates theme.\nKicking off the series, which took place during Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight, was a food fayre held at the Scottish Borders Campus.\nA total of 16 local producers and suppliers exhibited their products ranging from fresh fruit and baked goods, to homemade liqueurs and locally distilled gin.\nAll exhibitors were keen to not only raise the profile of their business in the local area, but also to support this inaugural event and provide inspiration to the College students.\nFormer College student Tegan Thomas from Galashiels was exhibiting the Thomas and Ethel Bakery.\nCompleting her catering course in 2015 with the intention of going on to train as a teacher, Tegan instead decided to use her newly gained knowledge and skills to set up a bakery specialising in allergy aware products.\nThomas and Ethel now operates on a wholesale basis from a unit at Tweedbank, priding itself on the bakery\u0026rsquos gluten free guarantee with items prepared in a completely safe environment.\nThe company is now aiming to supply to Morrison\u0026rsquos, as well as having been named runner-up wholesale bakery in The Scottish Food Awards 2018.\nBusiness students got involved in helping the stallholders to promote their goods, with one explaining on behalf of Caverton Mill Farm that the blueberries available for purchase had been picked only two days prior, making them a fresher option than buying from supermarkets.\nTilly Fuller, general mnager at Borderfields Oils, spoke of her desire to maintain a local connection for the 11 year old company, which was founded in Coldstream and now has its head office in Nottingham.\nRichard White of Freewheelin\u0026rsquo Brewery, makes the most of collaborating with local business.\nThe community owned brewery is hosted by the Peebles Hydro Hotel \u0026amp Spa, where the beer is stocked in the bar as well as being available for hotel guests to take home, making the brewery a unique visitor attraction.\nRichard was pleased to support the College food fayre, commenting that it was a great business networking opportunity as well as helping to raise the profile of the four old company.\nHot Sauce, produced in Nether Huntlywood near Earlston, is sold in delicatessens across the Borders, but the company is also reaping the rewards of e-commerce \u0026ndash not only are online customers their third largest customer base, they have shipped orders as far as Australia and New Zealand, opening up their product to a worldwide audience.\nAnd, Charlie Beaumont, Tourism Manager at The Borders Distillery in Hawick, quipped that they had brought \u0026lsquolocal gin in local glasses\u0026rsquo to the Local Food on Local Plates event.\nH added: \"We are really proud that our gin is made from scratch in Hawick, using malted barley grown in the Borders.\nProfessional chefs \u0026ndash Jacqueline O\u0026rsquoDonnell from The Sisters Restaurants, Glasgow, Amanda Jordan of the Firebrick Brasserie, Lauder, Iain Gourlay of Cringletie House Hotel, Peebles, and a joint demonstration by Jonny Millar of The Townhouse Hotel, Melrose and Craig Gibb of the neighbouring Burts Hotel provided sold-out chef demonstrations.\nThe catering and hospitality students themselves benefitted from the demonstrations, where Jacqueline taught one group how to make puff candy and butterscotch sauce, and the students learned some new cookery techniques shown by the chefs.\nThe students also took the chance to showcase their own developing skills by serving light lunches and refreshments to customers from their barista bar throughout the day.\nJacqueline O\u0026rsquoDonnell ed the following day to host a very special charity dinner in the College Restaurant.\nTicketholders included members of local industry and College staff, amongst other food enthusiasts keen to experience a meal cooked by the reputable chef.\nJacqueline herself was supported by willing and able students from all three levels of Catering and Hospitality programmes, keen to add to their skillsets and experience.\nLevel 2 student Rebecca Sharpe was delighted to experience working with The Sisters Restaurant chef. She said: \u0026ldquoIt has given us a bit more experience and tips on how to prepare dferent ingredients, such as peeling hazelnuts.\nLevel 3 student Erin McAleer added: \u0026ldquoI feel like the dinner went really well, and it helped to enhance the skills I\u0026rsquom currently learning at College.\nMoney raised went to the Hospitality Industry Trust Scotland , which provides support to a number of Borders College staff and students through craft scholarships, enabling them to enhance specic areas within their unique skillsets and to further develop their careers.\nCollege Principal Angela Cox highlighted that HIT Scotland\u0026rsquos mission chimes with that of Borders College in helping people to achieve their potential.\nDinner guests were served a smorgasbord of starters followed by a delicious lamb main course and trio of desserts, all created using local produce, many of which were purchased from food fayre exhibitors.\nChef Jacqueline said: \"Tonight\u0026rsquos menu came together under the Local Food on Local Plates brief, in collaboration with Borders College staff and students. It made sense to use as much local produce as we could.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a natural menu that reflects this part of the countryside, and my style of cooking.\nFiona Richmond of Scotland Food and Drink praised the evening\u0026rsquos menu, describing it as \u0026ldquoabsolute perfection.\nAnd David Cochrane, Chief Executive of HIT Scotland, who attended the dinner on behalf of the receiving charity was also enthusiastic.\nHe told us: \"The quality and passion behind the food tonight really put Scotland on the map and of that we\u0026rsquore really proud.\nHe also talked of the challenges of recruiting, and the essential practice of attracting people to the industry by showcasing the opportunities that are available and how up to date skills need to be developed, which is where scholarships really come to the fore.\nDinner guest Will Haegeland, deputy general manager of Cringletie House Hotel, is actively working to encourage increased tourism to the area as part of his role as Chair of the Scottish Borders Tourism Partnership.\nHe said: \"Food and tourism are key growth sectors in the Scottish Borders, and there aren\u0026rsquot many others.\n\"We have a chance to increase visitor numbers and bring new resources \u0026ndash we need to see more young people choosing hospitality as an industry of choice.\n\u0026ldquoIt is an exciting industry to be a part of and this is a great type of event to showcase that.

Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

He said: \u0026ldquoWe are about to begin consultation on our plans for the next stage of development at the National Museum of Flight and warmly invite members of the public to come and hear our plans and tell us what they think.  \u0026ldquoWe are working with Hoskins Architects to design an entirely new hangar to be built on land right next to the museum\u0026rsquos home at East Fortune Airfield.  \u0026ldquoThis would provide a permanent home for the museum\u0026rsquos star attraction, Scotland\u0026rsquos Concorde, and help us protect other historically important aircraft which are currently at risk because they are displayed outdoors.  \u0026ldquoThe new building would enable us to signicantly improve the experience for visitors to the museum by creating a new entrance with better public facilities.  \u0026ldquoIt also presents us with the opportunity to rethink and enhance the presentation of the historic Second World War airfield, which is an important artefact in its own right.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.

She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

Dunbar Cement Plant, which employs more than 140 people and contributes \u0026pound8 million to the local economy each year, has now been given the go-ahead to create a cement mill grinding station, storage silo and ious other facilities.

He plays for Dunbar Tennis Club and the East Lothian squad.  \u0026ldquoThey asked who was his favourite player is, which is Andy Murray.  \u0026ldquoCameron Norrie played against the Uzbek player and then Ben got pictures taken with Jamie Murray  and Dan Evans  and got some signed tennis balls.  \u0026ldquoBen was pleased about that and was able to watch Cameron Norrie win the match.  \u0026ldquoHe was quite excited and nervous as well. It is quite a big deal, with a big crowd and big stadium.  \u0026ldquoHe was really pleased with himself and had practised to toss the coin and make sure he did not muck it up.  Nine-year-old Ben, who plays alongside his big brother Luke, was nominated for the role by coaches Thomas Swan and Kevin Duffy, from the East Lothian tennis squad.  The youngster has been playing since he was just five years old.  The two coaches put the Dunbar Primary School pupil forward because of his good attitude and commitment to the sport.  The trip to Glasgow\u0026rsquos Emirates Arena, where Great Britain won 3-1 with Norrie, ranked 70 in the world, winning 6-2, 6-2, 6-0 to settle the encounter, gave Ben a taste of the big time, with the youngster playing in the East Lothian Open earlier this summer.  His mum added: \u0026ldquoHe found it quite inspiring.  \u0026ldquoJust to meet the players was inspiring and the whole atmosphere was very exciting."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-for-underground-homes-given-go-ahead","story":"  The proposals, for the development of land adjacent to Fidra House, on Dirleton Avenue, were approved by the council\u0026rsquos planning department.

Eight couples were paired up at the end of June and spent 10 weeks learning and perfecting their dance moves.  Jackie Gentil, who is principal teacher at Macmerry Primary School, was crowned the winner alongside her dance partner Jane Libberton.  Mairi O\u0026rsquoKeefe, Leuchie House CEO, said: \u0026ldquoWe are thrilled that Strictly Leuchie has raised so much for our charity again this year.  \u0026ldquoIt was a wonderful night and the dancers were incredible. To go from never having danced in public before to performing so well in front of a huge audience after only 10 weeks takes loads of hard work and commitment.  Joining Jackie on the dancefloor were Ali Wood , Alex Cunningham , Zoe Keddie-Dixon , Becky Everett , Callum Mark , Carol Fish , Joyce Lukkes-Presley  and Nicola Collin , along with seven professional dancers.  Each pair had a dferent dance style \u0026ndash such as the jive, pasodoble, samba, cha cha cha, Bollywood and Irish dance \u0026ndash to learn. After each couple had performed their routine, the audience voted for their three favourites.  Alex Cunningham and his partner Leigh Morrison, who performed a fast-paced Bollywood routine, which brought a touch of India to the Corn Exchange and Ali Wood, along with his partner Heather Antonelli, who did a salsa show dance to the soundtrack from The Greatest Showman, were announced as finalists alongside Jackie and Jane.  The audience then voted for a second time and chose Jackie and Jane and their high-kicking Irish dance as their winner.  Jackie, 46, who lives in Haddington with her husband and three sons, said she entered the competition after having a childhood desire to be in Pan\u0026rsquos People!  Her dance partner Jane is a mum-of-four from Dunbar. As well as working as a post lady for Royal Mail, she teaches Irish dancing at the Aine Hay Academy of Irish Dance. She devised and choreographed the winning dance routine to the song The Irish Rover.  This is the 11th year a Strictly-themed competition has been organised for charity by Bett Morrison, from Gford.  Tibor Poc and Hilary Mouat, the Scottish amateur ballroom and Latin American champions, performed two Latin American demonstration dances, with the Aine Hay Irish Academy and Dunbar School of Dance also entertaining.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ends-funding-for-kezia-dugdales-defence-in-wings-over-scotland-defamation-case","story":"  The move, which exposes Kezia Dugdale to potentially signicant costs, has been seen by some of her fellow MSPs as a \u0026ldquobetrayal and \u0026ldquofactionalism by her pro-Corbyn enemies.  Mr Campbell, 50, who runs the nationalist Wings Over Scotland website from his home in Bath, is suing Ms Dugdale for \u0026pound25,000 in a defamation action started last November.  It followed the Lothians MSP accusing him in her Daily Record column of making a homophobic remark about gay Scottish Secretary David Mundell.  Mr Campbell had said Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos son, the Tory MSP Oliver Mundell, was \u0026ldquothe sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner\".  In her column, Ms Dugdale said she was \u0026ldquoshocked and appalled to see a pro-independence blogger\u0027s homophobic tweets - Mr Campbell vigorously denies homophobia.  Until now, the UK labour party in London has bankrolled all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos legal support, paying for a QC and an advocate to conduct her defence at Edinburgh Sherf Court.  The costs so far are understand to be close to \u0026pound100,000.  However, to the shock of Ms Dugdale and many other Labour MSPs, the UK party has now ended the arrangement, leaving Ms Dugdale to fend for herself.  Although the party will bear all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos costs to date, it will not pay for any more legal counsel or any damages and costs  she loses.  It is understood UK Labour, which raised \u0026pound56m last year, did not tell Ms Dugdale directly of its decision, but informed her lawyers that it was no longer standing behind her case.  Ms Dugdale, 37, who was Scottish Labour leader from 2015 to 2017, opposed Jeremy Corby becoming UK leader, earning the lasting resentment of his supporters, who now dominate the party apparatus.  As the publisher of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos column, it is understood the Daily Record may now supply Ms Dugdale with legal support for the rest of the case.  However any help would not extend to damages and costs  Mr Campbell won his case.  Earlier this month, Sherf Kenneth McGowan refused Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos request to have the action thrown out and agreed to proceed to an evidential hearing.  Ms Dugdale had been on the point of appealing that decision when UK Labour withdrew its support, forcing her to scramble to lodge the appeal.  Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos spokesman said: \u0026ldquoGiven the principles on which it was founded - equality, fairness and justice - the UK Labour Party wholeheartedly committed to paying all legal costs associated with this case from start to finish.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much hoped that all promises will be kept.  UK Labour said: \u0026ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on a live, ongoing legal case.  Mr Campbell declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-loses-vote-on-p1-assessments","story":"  Holyrood voted 63 to 61 to pause and review tests for P1 pupils, after complaints from teachers about them being of little value, and parents reporting\u0026nbspchildren in tears.  The SNP government has promoted the standardised national assessments as a key tool to gather information about P1 children\u0026rsquos abilities and to fine tune their teaching.  The vote is not binding on the government, but was a blow to Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos reputation as Education Secretary, and a sign the opposition could embed it in law at a later date.  The decision saw the Greens, Labour and LibDems line up with the Tories while only the SNP voted for a continuation of the computer-based literacy and numeracy tests.  The government defeat came just three months after Mr Swinney was forced to shelve his flagship Education Bill because teachers and other parties would not support the reforms.  The Tory-led manoeuvre followed an often bad-tempered debate in which Mr Swinney and other SNP MSPs accused the Conservatives of rank hypocrisy and political opportunism.  Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party had previously advocated standardised tests at P1 and endorsed the government\u0026rsquos use of them in its 2016 Holyrood manesto.  Tory education spokeswoman said her party had been wrong in the past.  \u0026ldquoWe made a mistake about P1, she said, adding her party remained in favour of assessments at P4, P7 and S3.  She told the Education Secretary: \u0026ldquoI think the time has come, because of the evidence that has been piling up over the last two years, to call a halt, reconsider the evidence that is very much before us and evaluate what is the best way of progressing P1 pupils.\"  Mr Swinney said he was \u0026ldquoappalled by the Conservative Party and accused it of \u0026ldquodeceit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Conservatives are playing politics with the education of our children and we will not play along \u0026nbspwith them.  He defended the assessments as an essential part of a good education system, an integral part of effective teaching and learning, and part of \u0026ldquonormal classwork that took little time.  After the vote, other parties demanded the SNP respect the will of parliament, something ministers have repeatedly told Westminster to do on constitutional issues.  Ms Smith said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has voted decisively on this matter, and now the SNP government must act on that. The nationalists have ignored the evidence on this for quite some time, but they can\u0026rsquot afford to any longer.  \u0026ldquoThese tests need to be halted, and the evidence re-examined. The SNP is always talking about how important the Scottish Parliament is and how its will must be respected.  \u0026ldquoThis is the perfect chance for the SNP to do just that.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard used a point of order immediately after the vote to demand the government respect the outcome.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers told this government that these tests were useless, ministers ignored them. Parents told this government that they do not trust these tests, ministers ignored them.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has now voted to scrap these tests and SNP ministers must not now ignore the will of Parliament. The Government must therefore bring forward immediate plans for how it will respond to this evening\u0026rsquos vote as a matter of urgency.  Green education spokesman Ross Greer said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos truly shocking about the introduction of these standardised tests is that all the issues highlighted by Greens and others were already well known when the SNP decided to press ahead.  \u0026ldquoMembers of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos own International Council of Education Experts have been at the forefront of these criticisms and ministers still cannot explain why they would ignore their own experts, never mind the voices of a majority of Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers.  \u0026ldquoNow a majority in the Scottish Parliament have joined the calls to scrap these tests for four and five year olds and in a fit of arrogance, the government seems set to ignore our decision.  \u0026ldquoThe concerns that Greens have raised are not limited to the P1 tests. The whole concept of standardised testing does more harm than good to our young people. John Swinney should follow the evidence, accept the will of parliament and scrap the tests immediately.  But SNP MSP Gordon MacDonald said all the opposition parties were \u0026ldquoguilty of the most appalling hypocrisy for siding with the Tories to score political points.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government introduced p1 assessments because they are a tool we need to track kids\u0026rsquo progress and help drive up standards in our schools.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories put standardised P1 assessments in their manesto the majority of Tory-run councils across Scotland already assessed kids from P1 so did Labour and the Lib Dems.  \u0026ldquoLabour and the Lib Dems have sided with the Tories in their political gamesmanship, and sought to prey on the anxieties of parents, just to grab a headline.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos depressing that they all stood willing to do so at the expense of kids\u0026rsquo education.  \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to educating our young people, we should be united in an ambition to drive up standards \u0026ndash not exploiting these issues for political gain.  Sue Palmer, chair of the educational charity Upstart, which promoted a boycott of the assessments, said: \u0026ldquoThe opposition parties made many cogent arguments against the P1 testing and it\u0026rsquos very disappointing that the Scottish government isn\u0026rsquot prepared to listen to them.  \u0026ldquoWe at Upstart Scotland are particularly pleased that one of the closing speeches against the tests mentioned the long-term implications of beginning testing at such an early age in terms of children\u0026rsquos social and emotional development. \u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThere is growing evidence that the decline of self-directed play  coupled with an early focus on teaching specic academic skills is helping to fuel mental health problems among children and young people.    \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"john-swinney-to-proceed-until-apprehended-on-p1-testing","story":"  All the indications are the Education Secretary does not consider the Holyrood defeat on P1 assessments sufficient to arrest his plans, advising schools to continue for now.  Opposition parties argue Mr Swinney must obey the will of parliament, but voting figures of 63 to 61 show how close the decision was.  It was exactly this ergence of opinion that Mr Swinney faced when he addressed an audience of educational professionals at the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow on the morning of the vote.  As Storm Ali began to make itself heard around the auditorium of the SEC Centre, the minister would have expected a buffeting on testing as the audience of teachers, heads and other educational professionals were invited to ask questions.  It did not start well. A teacher from a primary school in Galashiels, in the Scottish Borders, said her experience of P1 testing was that they were not working.  \u0026ldquoThey are actually a huge waste of time and money in the way they are being enforced in primary schools, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt is not that I have an objection in principle to the idea of standardised assessments, but what I am seeing in practice is that they don\u0026rsquot work, they are not suitable and my colleagues around me feel exactly the same way.  \u0026ldquoThere is a widespread feeling in Scottish primary schools that they are not fit for purpose.  As Mr Swinney scribbled hastily into his notebook in preparation for a dficult answer, a headteacher from another primary school came to his rescue.  \u0026ldquoWe did not find any level of stress at all and the primary one children actually quite enjoyed taking part, she said.  \u0026ldquoIn terms of the feedback we found them to be extremely helpful. We had a small group of boys that I think we had the wrong measure of when it came down to teacher judgement and it changed how we looked at the support they needed. I think we had underestimated them.  \u0026ldquoThe depth of feedback and the quality of feedback the assessments gave us really helped those children.  Mr Swinney said the contrasting remarks illustrated the ergence of opinion on the benefits of the assessments for five-year-olds.  But what he was at pains to stress to the audience was his belief in the quality of feedback they could provide.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat literally drew an intake of breath from a group of teachers who went through the assessments with me was when they saw the diagnostic information and the way it was presented.  \u0026ldquoIt marshalled some of the strengths and the challenges that young people face and the purpose of standardised assessments is to make sure we are able to learn from what the experience of young people has been, what their challenges are and then to do something about it.  \u0026ldquoThe attainment gap exists when young people come into formal education and the challenge is to try and narrow that as quickly as we possibly can which is why I take the view that P1 assessments are helpful in that respect.  Lurking in the audience to hijack the Education Secretary further on assessments was Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union.  Mr Flanagan, whose union has backed a campaign to encourage parents to opt out of P1 testing, raised the issue of councils who blanket test pupils, rather than allowing inidual teachers to decide - a phenomenon blamed for greater levels of pupil stress.  Mr Flanagan said: \u0026ldquoA set of guidelines was produced, one of which was that teachers would control when these assessments were done.  \u0026ldquoWe know that 25 out of 32 local authorities breached that guideline and instructed teachers when to carry out the assessments.  With a nod to his past as a secondary school English teacher, Mr Flanagan then drew on the words of Hamlet to ask: \u0026ldquoSo in terms of empowerment, there\u0026rsquos the rub. How do we turn rhetoric around professional autonomy into a reality?  Mr Swinney conceded that he did not agree with Mr Flanagan on many things, and also expressed mock surprise the union leader had not taken the opportunity to raise the ongoing issue of pay.  But Mr Flanagan did get a concession from the minister on the need to ensure the guidance was being followed.  Mr Swinney said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot always say this, but I agree with Larry Flanagan. The guidance is clear that teachers should choose at what point it is appropriate to undertake the assessments and that should be respected and I will pursue that in my discussion with local authorities."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-tells-eu-leaders-in-salzburg-chequers-is-only-credible-plan-on-the-table","story":"  As the Prime Minister promoted her compromise proposals over dinner with fellow European leaders at an informal summit in Salzburg, Carwyn Jones, the Welsh First Minister, intervened, arguing that  Holyrood and Cardf were to oppose the final Brexit deal, then there should be a general election, which could eventually lead to another EU referendum.  \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster Edinburgh and Cardf. If that doesn\u0027t happen, then I don\u0027t see any alternative other than a general election where Brexit would be the main issue.  The Bridgend AM added that  there were an inconclusive result at an election, then there would be \u0026ldquopotential for a second referendum\".  When asked  the Scottish Government agreed with Mr Jones\u0026rsquos point about a potential general election, a spokesman for Michael Russell, the Constitutional Affairs Secretary, replied: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has already rejected Brexit and we will make sure that Holyrood has the chance to continue to make its voice heard as the Tories drag us close to the clf edge of a no-deal or a blind Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIt simply should not come down to a choice between those options: the catastrophic or the merely disastrous, he added.  Before the Salzburg dinner began at the Felsenreitschule - the theatre made famous by the von Trapp family in the film The Sound of Music \u0026ndash Mrs May insisted her Brexit blueprint was \"the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland and also delivers on the vote of the British people\".  She stressed: \"If we are going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too.\"  But ahead of the dinner Donald Tusk, the European Council President, made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Announcing a special EU summit in mid-November \u0026ndash which will set the scene for signing any Brexit agreement \u0026ndash Mr Tusk said that while there was \u0026ldquomore hope a deal would be done, there was \u0026ldquoless time in which to do it.  Today, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary in a speech in Munich will insist the Chequers Plan was \u0026ldquoalways a non-starter and he and his fellow Brexiteers would \u0026ldquoshortly be presenting an alternative plan which will outline a more ambitious vision\".  On her arrival in Austria, the PM welcomed how Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, had recognised his original plan for the Irish border was unworkable and had sought to come up with an \u0026ldquoimproved solution. But Whitehall sources made clear that the private suggestions about Brussels\u0027s new proposals were unacceptable as they still did not drop the view that Northern Ireland could be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the UK.  Mrs May stressed: \u0026ldquoWhat we cannot accept is seeing Northern Ireland carved away from the UK customs territory because, regardless of where the checks would be, what that would mean would be that it would be a challenge to our constitutional and economic integrity.\"  She also decried \u0026ldquoprominent Labour members like the Mayor of London, who were now trying to take Britain \u0026ldquoback to square one with support for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on Brexit.  \"I want to be absolutely clear, this government will never accept a second referendum, declared the PM, adding: \"We held a People\u0027s Vote it was the referendum in 2016.  \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave the European Union, it is now a matter of trust in politicians that we should deliver on the vote of the British people,\" she added.  Earlier, Lord Steel, the former Liberal leader, urged the PM to make a television broadcast to call off Brexit and announce a second referendum.  \u0026ldquoIn the words of the popular American song, he added, \u0026ldquolet\u0026rsquos call the whole thing off.  The intervention by the former Holyrood Presiding Office came after a People\u0027s Vote report, written by fellow Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who authored Article 50, suggested Mrs May could be forced to concede a second referendum by a vote of MPs or that she could even decide to call one herself. It stressed the option of staying in the EU \"must be on the ballot paper\"."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-govt-criticised-for-not-using-majority-share-holding-to-halt-rbs-branch-closures","story":"  The cross-party Scottish Affairs Committee had urged the UK Government that,  the bank did not act on its recommendation to stop the closures, then  should \u0026ldquouse any influence that its majority shareholding provides to apply pressure on RBS to reconsider the closure programme.  But the Government declined to do so, declaring: \u0026ldquoGovernments should not be in the business of owning banks nor should they intervene in the commercial, operational or management decisions of business.  Such decisions, it argued, were rightly the responsibility of boards and management teams, who were \u0026ldquobest placed to set strategy and commercial direction and to make day-to-day management decisions.  Last December, RBS announced it would shut a total of 62 branches north of the border but later ten of them were given a stay of execution until at least the end of this year, pending a review.  Committee member Danielle Rowley, the Scottish Labour MP for Midlothian, said the Government\u0026rsquos response was disappointing and showed it continued to \u0026ldquowash its hands of branch closures.  \u0026ldquoBut  it continues with its stated aim to  RBS to private ownership without making a strategic intervention to solve this problem, taxpayers will rightly ask what good their investment did beyond the initial emergency bailout, she said.  Ms Rowley accused the Government of being \"wedded to their dogma that the state has no role in the commercial banking sector, and claimed the Tories were missing a golden opportunity to make a positive dference and support communities across Scotland.  Noting how in her own constituency Bonnyrigg had lost the last bank on the high street and was now facing the prospect of losing its Post Office too, the backbencher added: \u0026ldquoThe evidence gathered by the committee was clear and our recommendations were reasonable. It is unfortunate that the Government has chosen to bury its head in the sand.\"  In 2008 following the financial crash, the taxpayer bailed out RBS to the tune of \u0026pound45 billion.  In June when the Government sold off another tranche of shares \u0026ndash at a loss of \u0026pound2.1bn \u0026ndash the public stake in the bank fell from 70.1 per cent to 62.4. The sale raised \u0026pound2.5bn.  The Government has said it intends to sell \u0026pound15bn-worth of RBS shares by 2023. The overall loss to the taxpayer is set to be around \u0026pound26bn.  In February, the bank reported an annual profit of \u0026pound752 million its first for a decade and a sharp turnaround from the \u0026pound6.95bn loss seen the previous year."},{"url":null,"title":"hogmanay-sends-a-forget-me-not-love-letter-to-the-eu-and-the-world","story":"  The famous quote did come to mind when I spoke to Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam this week about their European-themed Hogmanay celebrations.  Hamlet being a European tragedy, perhaps it was apt.  Both Wood and Bartlam, who as Underbelly are once again planning the three-day Hogmanay event, said that the European focus of this year\u0026rsquos celebrastion - a \u0026lsquolove letter\u0026rsquo in fact - is not a lament for Brexit, or a last, and loving, farewell to Scotland being part of the EU.  Mr Wood noted, accurately, of course, that the British islands are in Europe, geographically and culturally, whether anyone likes it or not. He says the focus is purely a apolitical one.  Well. Whether you believe that or not  this notably yearning Hogmanay theme - which involves noted writers in a series of commissions, musicians, and others - however, cannot be seen separately from our context, the prospect of the UK leaving the EU. Why else send a \u0026lsquoforget me not\u0026rsquo love letter?  It is fair to say that much of the cultural world is viewing Brexit with, as with the majority of Scots, alarm, consternation and dismay.  Mr Wood and Mr Bartlam, who are successful venue operators at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, know this. They will also know the power of the Hogmanay celebrations, which are seen by people around the globe.

Ms Sturgeon has written to opposition leaders in London, arguing that  the UK failed to agree a deal with the EU, the timetable for talks must be extended.  The SNP leader said: \"It\u0027s time for everyone in the UK political establishment to wake up to the reality of what now faces us.  \"If the choice we face is between no-deal and no detail, then an extension to the Article 50 negotiation period must be on the table as the only way to avoid an economic clf edge, and allow all alternative options to be considered.\"  At a dinner with fellow European leaders in Salzburg, Austria, on Wednesday night, Mrs May continued to argue her Chequers proposals were the only credible route to a deal.  The PM\u0027s message was that while the time for an agreement to be reached was now short, \"delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option\", according to a senior UK official.  Mrs May has been adamant that there will be no second referendum on Brexit nor any extension to Article 50 ie Britain will leave the EU on March 29 next year.  But the FM insisted it \"seems increasingly likely\" that the statement setting out the future relationship between the UK and the EU \"will be vague and lacking in meaningful detail\".  \"The Tory Government has been busy trying to paint Brexit as a choice between a no-deal Brexit and the inadequate Chequers proposal, but in reality that is a false dichotomy thanks to their incompetence, infighting and indecision, it seems increasingly likely that the choice will be between a no-deal Brexit and a blind Brexit.  \"Both options are unpalatable and completely unacceptable, declared Ms Sturgeon.  \"A no-deal Brexit will, by the UK Government\u0027s own admission, lead to dire economic consequences and a shortage of medicines and foodstuffs.  \"Meanwhile, a blind Brexit will simply kick all of the dficult decisions into the long grass - but with the UK already out of the EU.  \"Not only would that continue the uncertainty, it would be tantamount to stepping off a clf edge blindfolded, with no idea of what the landing place will be.\"  Ms Sturgeon added: \"Even at this late stage, Theresa May can escape the corner into which she has boxed herself.

It has strong association with the renowned Scottish poet Robert Burns, who wrote several pieces specically for its stage.  The theatre saw multiple changes of ownership during the first half of the 20th Century, before being bought by the Guild of Players in 1959.    The Guild managed to secure support from new sources and instead of planning on building new facilities upwards, they looked towards expanding outwards. Adjacent buildings were purchased, and renovation work began in 2014, completed by the end of 2015. The newly refurbished building includes several new spaces while maintaining many of the historic features, ushering Scotland\u0026rsquos oldest theatre into the 21st Century.  Attend one of the touring productions presented throughout the year, which includes live music, stand-up comedy and theatrical dramas. The Guild of Players presents a regular season of four shows, as well as a family-friendly Christmas pantomime.    Grab a drink at the bar before the show or enjoy a mean from the customised theatre menus at nearby restaurants. Want to get hands-on at the theatre? You can participate in one of the workshops or join our group of fantastic volunteers and help build sets and design costumes.

Yesterday a panel of Mackintosh experts, including Roger Billclfe, the gallerist and writer, and Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, gave evidence to Holyrood\u0026rsquos Culture Committee.  They said the Mackintosh Building, destroyed in the second of two fires in four years, should be rebuilt and an expert panel should be established to oversee the task.  : Why Glasgow\u0027s patience on the Mack is wearing thin  However Sandra White, MSP for Glasgow Kelvin, said the GSA board, whose chair Muriel Gray vowed this week to rebuild the world-famous building, appeared \u0026ldquonot fit for purpose.  She said: \u0026ldquoI think it is criminal it has happened twice and I want that on record...as far as I am concerned, no lessons have been learned from the 2014 fire.  Ms White added: \u0026ldquoDo you think the board is fit for purpose? And should the iconic building be taken under public control, and out of the hands of the board? Because from what I have seen there is a lack of transparency, no communication with the local community at all, I don\u0026rsquot think they are fit for purpose.  Mr Billclfe, whose written evidence suggest the Mackintosh Building should be taken out of the GSA\u0026rsquos control, said the building was a \u0026ldquofire trap waiting to happen before the first conflagration in 2014.  : Why the Mack shall be rebuilt, by Muriel Gray  He said: \u0026ldquoThe staff are still there that were responsible for it.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot want to send them to prison but I want to make sure that they don\u0026rsquot operate a system where they can do it again.  A former senior employee at the art school, Eileen Reid, said anyone that worked in the school before the first blaze knew it was a fire risk.  \u0026ldquoWe all knew it. We used to talk about how many minutes we would have to get out, she said.  \u0026ldquoOf course I was concerned about the iconic building but there was a risk to le too.  She questioned why an immediate investigation into fire risk management was not carried out after it \u0026ldquofailed in 2014 fire, adding: \u0026ldquoI do think it was systemic.  Malcolm Fraser, the architect, said the cause of the second blaze could be partially the failure of statutory oversight.  : How the Mack will be rebuilt, by GSA chair  Mr Robertson said it would be tragedy  the building was lost forever.  \u0026ldquoYou wouldn\u0026rsquot build student flats on top of Edinburgh Castle  it burnt down, he said.  \u0026ldquoFor it to disappear would be a tragedy and it would show that Scotland doesn\u0026rsquot care about culture.  Speaking after the meeting, committee convener Joan McAlpine said: \u0026ldquoWe heard today that there were systemic failures in managing risk in the Mackintosh Building.  \u0026ldquoThe committee will be taking further evidence, including inviting representatives from the Glasgow School of Art, in order to bring greater transparency and clarity to this issue.  \u0026ldquoWhile it is for expert investigators to tell us the cause of the fire, there are wider issues about the conservation and custodianship of Mackintosh\u0026rsquos building and artworks and we believe as a committee it is right that we shine a light on these matters.  : \u0027Relieve the GSA of the Mack\u0027 says expert  Culture committee member and Green MSP Ross Greer added: \u0026ldquoNot only is the GSA in receipt of huge amounts of public money, it was the custodian of the jewel in Scotland\u0026rsquos architectural crown.  \u0026ldquoWe need an end to the secrecy and smoke and mirrors.  \u0026ldquoAbsolute clarity needs to be provided on their involvement in the site in the lead up to the second fire.  \u0026ldquoThis tragic saga raises real concerns over whether the School of Art would be a fit and proper custodian of a rebuilt and refurbished Mack.  A spokesman for the Glasgow School of Art said: \u0026ldquoParliamentary Committees invite iniduals and organisations with an interest in a subject to contribute to a process of information gathering, and the four witnesses who took part into today\u0026rsquos hearing have shared their particular perspectives.  \u0026ldquoWe anticipate being to be invited to participate in a future hearing as part of the process of enabling the panel to achieve its stated aim of ascertaining how we got to the current position and what lessons were learned."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-does-not-rule-out-approving-indyref2-if-he-becomes-pm","story":"  The Labour leader made clear that he would \"decide at the time\" what to do  Nicola Sturgeon asked for his consent to hold another poll.  However, he stressed that his party did not want a referendum and would be \"very clear on why we don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea\".  In 2017, Mr Corbyn sparked controversy when he suggested that  Holyrood voted for another vote on Scotland\u0026rsquos future, as it did in March of that year, then it should not be blocked. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think it\u0026rsquos the job of Westminster or the Labour Party to prevent people holding referenda, he said.  But before the last Holyrood election Labour gave a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that it would oppose another referendum.  In an interview with BBC Scotland ahead of this weekend\u0026rsquos start to the Labour conference, Mr Corbyn was asked what he would do  the First Minister, asked for the power to hold another vote on independence Westminster\u0027s consent would be need  any referendum were to be legally binding.  He replied: \"We would obviously decide at the time.\"  Pointing to the \u0026pound13 billion budget deficit in Scotland, the party leader said a Labour government would invest money in Scotland through a \u0026pound20bn transformation fund and a \u0026pound3bn increase in revenue spending.  \"Things will be very dferent in Scotland with an ally in Westminster like a Labour government,\" he declared.  When he was asked whether he was ruling out giving Ms Sturgeon consent for a referendum to be held, Mr Corbyn replied: \"I\u0027m not ruling[it] out I\u0027m just pointing out the reality.  \"We don\u0027t want another referendum, we don\u0027t think another referendum is a good idea and we\u0027ll be very clear on why we don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0027s more important is dealing with child poverty, housing problems and lack of investment in Scotland 200,000 more children going into poverty has to be dealt with. A referendum will not solve that.\"  The Scottish Labour manesto at the 2016 Holyrood election said: \u0026ldquoWe rule out another referendum on independence during the letime of the next Parliament.  At the general election a year later, then Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale also gave a \u0026ldquocast iron guarantee that Labour would oppose a second referendum, saying independence would lead to \u0026ldquoturbo charged austerity.  The Scottish Tories said Labour looked \u0026ldquoutterly weak on the constitutional question.  Adam Tomkins, the Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman, said: \u0026ldquoEvery time Jeremy Corbyn talks about Scotland he gives yet another concession to the SNP.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos more proof that Labour are utterly weak when it comes to Scotland\u0026rsquos place in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn does not care about Scotland and has no interest in standing up to the Nationalists, as this latest gaffe proves, he added.  Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said: \u0026ldquoThis is an extraordinary opinion from Jeremy Corbyn. So many people with moderate and progressive views will be horried by this careless attitude towards the UK. Liberal Democrats are opposed to independence and opposed to another isive independence referendum.\"  He added: \"The case against independence is even stronger since the SNP\u0026rsquos Growth Commission admitted what we said about independence in 2014 was right. Brexit also shows that breaking up long standing unions is costly and hard to do.  Ms Sturgeon is expected to make an announcement on her plans for a future vote on Scotland\u0026rsquos future once the terms of any Brexit deal become clear, which means probably some time in November.  SNP depute leader Keith Brown said:\u0026nbsp\"We already have the democratic mandate to give the people of Scotland a choice over their future \u0026ndash a position backed by the Scottish Parliament. For any Prime Minister to stand in the way of that would be a democratic outrage.  \"Of course, it used to be the case that Labour thought the people of Scotland were sovereign and should determine their own future. Now, apparently, it\u0026rsquos down to the whim of the MP for Islington North.\"  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoLike the majority of the people of Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn doesn\u0027t want to see a second referendum.  \"Jeremy is clear that independence is not in the interests of Scotland and the Scottish people and would lead to intensied and prolonged austerity something even the SNP Growth Commission now recognises.  \u0026ldquoThe real ide in Scotland is between the richest and the poorest - not the false ision created by another referendum.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-theresa-may-stumbles-in-salzburg-as-eu27-says-chequers-plan-unworkable","story":"  Eyes jumping from side to side, nostrils flaring and hands gesticulating, the Prime Minister was screaming inside. Her frustration at trying to square the seemingly impossible Brussels circle was clear for all to see.  Perspiring in a sultry press conference room, Theresa May could not hid her anger following the \u0026ldquofrank exchanges she had had minutes earlier with Donald Tusk, the leader of the EU leaders, who publicly and coolly delivered the last rites to her Chequers Plan.  UK diplomatic sources had expected a bust-up but thought it would come at the October 18/19 European Council. The breakdown now at least gives the UK negotiators more time before the very final deadline of mid-November.  The Prime Minister confirmed that the UK was building up a new proposal to unblock the logjam on the Irish border issue.  It is thought this would entail having \u0026ldquoregulatory checks at Irish Sea ports these are technically dferent but similar to customs checks. Such checks already exist between Northern Ireland and the British mainland in regard to agricultural products.  The hope must be with this suggestion and the EU\u0026rsquos pledge to \u0026ldquode-dramatise its own backstop plan, there is a chance that they could meet somewhere in the middle to prevent a hard border with Ireland and avoid a no-deal Brexit.  Yet the key will be not just whether Brussels can accept what many would regard a fudge but also whether the Democratic Unionists, who just so happen provide the PM with her Commons majority, will be able to do so.  The Salzburg rejection now leaves Mrs May looking bruised and battered, seeking friends where few can be found for her compromise. Brexiteers hate it, Remainers hate it, Brussels hates it.  And the timing could not be worse.  In just over a week\u0026rsquos time the Tories gather in Birmingham for what one MP helpfully dubbed a \u0026ldquoBrexit bloodbath.  Various colleagues will be \u0026ldquoon manoeuvres, sensing the smell of political blood, not least Boris Johnson, who has his Chuck Chequers rally before the party leader gives her keynote speech.  Her aides will be making sure there will be plenty of water and cough toffees on the lectern and, instead of letters on the backdrop, there will be a projected message.  If the Maybot can survive the Tory turmoil in Birmingham, there will be just two weeks to reset her plan to try to get the EU27 on board.  Of course, it may be that the old political rouse is being worked here: make things look so desperately bad that when victory is seized from the jaws of defeat at the last moment, the sense of achievement and relief is all the greater.  Or, it could be as bad as it looks."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8713295.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jeremy-corbyn-backed-petition-to-save-one-of-edinburghs-historic-streets-finally-accepted","story":"  The Save Leith Walk campaign was launched to fight plans for a \u0026pound50 million redevelopment which the group says\u0026nbspignores the historical signicance of the street.

The rise in people fearing homelessness has been blamed on harsh welfare cuts, the high cost of keeping a home, stagnant wages and a shortage of affordable houses on the market.  Graeme Brown, Director of Shelter Scotland, said that rough sleepers were \"dying on the streets\" and called for greater action to tackle homelessness.  He said: \u0026ldquoLast year we had to help more people than ever before, which is why, in our 50th anniversary year, we\u0026rsquore not celebrating.  \"We thought that by now bad housing and homelessness would be largely a thing of the past, but instead our services are needed more than ever.\"  :\u0026nbspHomeless given help to access Universal Credit online    The charity\u0027s annual report revealed that it provided help to 21,290 people last year, an all-time high. Its website was accessed at a rate of 17,000 times per week with demands for information, with half of those getting in contact saying they needed advice on how to\u0026nbspkeep their homes.  Nearly two in three people who came to the charity were women, with the majority speaking of\u0026nbspstruggling to afford housing costs as the biggest problem they faced.  The pressures were revealed to be nationwide. In formerly oil-rich Aberdeen, hit hard by the downturn in the industry, 70 per cent of all calls were from people worried about losing their home, the highest figure in the country.  The spike the numbers turning to the charity for aid comes after the number of applications for homelessness in Scotland rose for the first time in nearly a decade this year.  The Shelter Scotland\u0026nbspreport also contained a warning of a ticking timebomb, with young people making up nearly half of those who sought advice about homelessness last year.  :\u0026nbsp38 children a day made homeless last year    Mr Brown added: \"The number of homeless children is at a 10-year high. Unknown numbers are sofa surfing with friends and families as they don\u0026rsquot have, or cannot afford, a home of their own.  \u0026ldquoBehind those statistics are people, families, iniduals \u0026ndash people on low incomes, people with complex needs, people in crisis - some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  \u0026ldquoThese are the people we help day-in, day-out and, until there\u0026rsquos a decent, safe and secure home for everyone, we\u0026rsquoll carry on fighting for everyone in Scotland facing bad housing and homelessness.  Almost 40 per cent of those appealing for help were private renters \u0026ndash a disproportionately high number compared to the size of the private rental sector, which makes up just 15 per cent of all housing in Scotland.  Clients were helped via Shelter Scotland\u0027s free national helpdesk, digital chat service and one-to-one advice sessions.  Ewan Aitken, Chief Executive of the homeless charity, Cyrenians, fully recognised the figures revealed by the Shelter Scotland report.  He said: \"There is without question more people feeling a heightened level of anxiety about their home, their jobs and their relationships.  \"As the Shelter reports says, we are encountering more people under greater pressure than ever before because of the ongoing policies of austerity.  \"And it\u0027s not just the number of people finding themselves without a roof over their heads.

If the ECJ rules that Parliament can stop Article 50 without the permission of the other 27 EU states, it would reduce the odds of a No Deal Brexit.  It would also undermine Theresa May\u0026rsquos negotiating strength as she tries to get backing in Brussels for her Chequers deal after being told it \u0026ldquowill not work byEU leaders yesterday.  The legal battle was led by Green MSP Andy Wightman, alongside his fellow Green MSP Ross Greer, Labour MEPs Catherine Stihler and David Martin, and SNP MEP Alyn Smith.  The SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and LibDem MP Christine Jardine were also involved.  They asked the Court of Session for a reference to the ECJ on whether parliamentarians could instruct the UK government to withdraw the Article 50 notication underlying Brexit.  Their case was initially dismissed, but they have now won an appeal heard by the Lord President Lord Carloway, Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young.  Mr Wightman said he was \u0026ldquodelighted at the unanimous ruling.  Earlier this year, lawyers acting for the UK Government, which opposed the action, claimed the politicians\u0026rsquo arguments were \u0026ldquohypothetical and academic, and did not reflect political reality on the ground and the European judges should not rule on the matter.  In June, Lord Boyd of Duncansby agreed, saying revoking Article 50 was not \u0026ldquoa live practical question and the petition was \u0026ldquoa clear and dangerous encroachment on the sovereignty of Parliament, as it was up to Parliament to decide whether it wanted an ECJ ruling.  However in a written judgement issued on Friday, Lord Carloway said the question of revocation was \u0026ldquoneither academic not premature as matters had moved on.  He wrote: \"It is clear in terms of the European Union  Act 2018, that MPs will be required to vote on whether to raty any agreement between the UK government and EU council  \"If no other proposal is proffered, a vote against ratication, will result in the UK\u0027s departure from the EU on March 29 2019 a date which is looming up.  \"It seems neither academic nor premature to ask whether it is legally competent to revoke the notication and thus to remain in the EU.  \"The matter is uncertain in that it is the subject of a dispute as this litigation perhaps demonstrate.  \"The answer will have the effect of clarying the options open to MPs in the lead up to what is now an inevitable vote.  \"Whatever the interests of MSPs, and MEPs, MPs have an interest in seeing the matter resolved.  \"In these circumstances reference to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling is necessary.\"  Lord Carloway included a draft text of the reference to the court.  It asks for a ruling on whether EU law permits an Article 50 notice \u0026ldquoto be revoked unilaterally by an EU member state after it has notied its withdrawal \"and,  so, subject to what conditions and with what effect relative to the Member State remaining within the EU\".  It also requests an \"expedited\" procedure\u0026nbspin \u0026ldquolight of the urgency of the urgency of the issue in terms of parliamentary consideration and voting in advance of 29 March 2019.  In his opinion, Lord Menzies said he was \u0026ldquoin complete agreement with the Lord President\u0026rsquos conclusions, reasoning and solution.  Mr Greer, the Europe spokesperson for the Scottish Greens, said:\u0026nbsp\"This sound judgement from the Court of Session paves the way for at least one bit of clarity amid the Tories\u0027 Brexit chaos.  \"It is entirely reasonable for us to ask whether the UK Parliament can revoke the triggering of Article 50 and end the Brexit process.  \"We know that the UK Tory Government, in the grip of Brexit extremists, has no intention of revoking Article 50 but that\u0027s not the point.  \"This is about ensuring MPs are fully informed of their options at this time of national crisis.  \"If negotiations collapse, as appears to be happening, we have to know that a No-Deal disaster is not the only option on the table.\"  Ms Cherry, who represents Edinburgh South West, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom delighted that Scotland\u0026rsquos Supreme Court has unanimously agreed with myself and my fellow petitioners that it\u0026rsquos vital for MPs to know whether Article 50 is unilaterally revocable before they are asked to raty any agreement between the UK and the EU Council.  \u0026ldquoGiven Theresa May\u0026rsquos humiliation in Salzburg yesterday the answer to this question is particularly important.  \u0026ldquoI look forward to the Court of Justice of the European Union\u0026rsquos ruling, she added."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-reveals-harassment-case-numbers","story":"  Official data also revealed there have been up to 41 such cases since 2013 in the government\u0026rsquos central directorates, which employ around 5200 people.

In response to a separate parliamentary question from Labour MSP Monica Lennon, the government said it knew of 11 formal complaints of sexual harassment by staff since 2007.  It said it had no record of such complaints against ministers since 1999 and the end of 2017, and no record of any such complaints against their special advisers since 2007.  The 11 complaints against staff since 2007 covered the core government departments and a series of smaller civil servant operations which currently employ around 6850 staff.  It said the cases \u0026ldquowere dealt with in line with the relevant internal procedures.  The information emerged as the government answered a series of freedom of information requests, many lodged by the opposition parties, about Alex Salmond.  The former First Minister was accused by two women in January of sexual misconduct relating to his time in office in 2013.  He has denied harassment and criminality and is taking legal action against the government and its top official, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, over the handling of the case.  Backed by a \u0026pound100,000 crowdfunded appeal, he is seeking a judicial review of the complaint handling process, arguing he was denied a fair chance to respond to the allegations.  The Scottish Government issued similar responses to around a dozen FoI requests asking for details of what ministers knew about the case, records and correspondence.  The government repeatedly said it \u0026ldquocannot confirm or deny whether any information is held as disclosure \u0026ldquowould be likely to prejudice substantially the administration of justice.  Questions about when and how many times Ms Sturgeon met Mr Salmond and discussed his case after the complaints were lodged were rebuffed on this basis.  Mr Salmond has said he raised his case three times in person with Ms Sturgeon, and was the first person to inform her that he was the subject of the complaints.  The government also cited exemptions from FoI law when asked for any correspondence between Ms Sturgeons and her husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, on the case.  The government this week notied the Court of Session that it intended to defend Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos action \u0026ldquovigorously, although it did not object to him bringing it in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"prime-minister-says-uk-and-eu-are-long-way-apart-on-two-main-issues","story":"              Theresa May has called on the EU to come forward with fresh proposals on Northern Ireland and trade, warning that without a move from Brussels it will not be possible to make further progress in Brexit talks.  Speaking in 10 Downing Street a day after the humiliating rejection of her Brexit plans at the EU summit in Salzburg, the Prime Minister recognised that negotiations had reached an \"impasse\".  But she dismissed EU suggestions that the onus is on Britain to sht its stance, insisting that the ball is now in the European Union\u0027s court.  Mrs May said she was ready to come forward with new ideas on unblocking the disagreement over future arrangements at the Irish border.  But, in apparent reference to European Council President Donald Tusk\u0027s assertion that her Chequers plan \"will not work\", she said: \"At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side\u0027s proposals without a detailed explanation and new proposals.  \"So we now need to hear from the European Union what the real issues are and what their proposals are so we can discuss them.  \"Until we do, we can\u0027t make progress.\"  Mrs May added: \"No-one wants a good deal more than me, but the European Union should be clear - I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country.  \"We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations and we stand ready.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dubrovnik-overloaded-with-tourists-after-game-of-thrones","story":"  The citadel known as the jewel of the Adriatic is a Unesco World Heritage Site and cruise ships regularly dock there, bringing hordes of tourists keen to sample delights such as the Stradun, a pedestrian street.  Dubrovnik is a prime example of the effects of mass tourism, a global phenomenon by which the increase in people travelling means the standout cites, particularly small ones, get overwhelmed by crowds.  As the numbers of visitors keeps rising, local authorities are looking for ways to keep the throngs from killing off the town\u0027s charm.  \"It\u0027s beyond belief, it\u0027s like living in the middle of Disneyland,\" says Marc van Bloemen from his house overlooking the bustling Old Harbour in the shadows of the stone city walls.  He thinks the town is in danger of becoming a mere tourist site  something is not done fast.  On a typical day there are about eight cruise ships visiting this town of 2,500 people, each dumping some 2,000 tourists into the streets.  He recalls one day when 13 ships anchored here.  \"We feel sorry for ourselves, but also for them  because they can\u0027t feel the town anymore because they are knocking into other tourists,\" he said.  \"It\u0027s chaos, the whole thing is chaos.\"  The problem is already hurting Dubrovnik\u0027s reputation.  Unesco warned last year that the city\u0027s world heritage title was at risk because of the surge in tourist numbers.  The popular Discoverer travel blog recently wrote that a visit to the historic town \"is a highlight of any Croatian vacation, but the crowds that pack its narrow streets and passageways don\u0027t make for a quality visitor experience\".  It said that the extra attention the city gets from being a filming location for Game Of Thrones combines with the cruise ship arrivals to create \"a problem of epic proportions\".  It advises that travellers would be better served visiting other quaint old towns nearby: \"Instead of trying to be one of the lucky ones who gets a ticket to Dubrovnik\u0027s sites, try the delightful town of Ohrid in nearby Macedonia.\"  In 2017, local authorities announced a Respect The City plan that limits the number of tourists from cruise ships to a maximum of 4,000 at any one time during the day.  The plan still has to be implemented, however.  \"We are aware of the crowds,\" said Romana Vlasic, the head of the town\u0027s tourist board.  But while on the one hand she pledged to curb the number of visitors, Ms Vlasic noted with some satisfaction that this season in Dubrovnik \"is really good with a slight increase in numbers\".  The success of the Croatian national football team at this summer\u0027s World Cup, where they reached the final, helped bring new tourists.  Ms Vlasic said over 800,000 tourist visited Dubrovnik since the start of the year, a 6% increase from the same period last year, and had three million overnight stays, which is a 4% increase.  The cruise ships pay the city harbour docking fees, but the local businesses get very little money from the visitors, who have all-inclusive packages on board the ship and spend very little on local restaurants or shops  Krunoslav Djuricic, who plays his electric guitar at Pile, one of the two main entrances of Dubrovnik\u0027s walled city, sees the crowds pass by him all day and believes that \"mass tourism might not be what we really need\".  The tourists disembarking from the cruise ships have only a few hours to visit the city, meaning they often rush around to see the sites and take selfies to post to social media.  \"We have crowds of people who are simply running,\" Mr Djuricic says.  \"Where are these people running to?\""},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie campaign to be discussed at holyrood","story":"        The Save Bennachie Alliance will head to the Scottish Parliament this week to discuss its campaign.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here.

They like the look of the dog when it\u0027s a puppy and then they take it home and think, \u0027I can\u0027t be bothered with it.\u0027\"A Scottish SPCA spokesman said people should re-home a rescue pet, rather than buy online, while a Gumtree spokesman insisted it had taken steps to safeguard animals by introducing the fee.Meanwhile, a Preloved spokeswoman stressed that although sellers existed that don\u0027t have an animal\u0027s best interests at heart, they are in the minority.Friday 21 Sep 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Students get on their bikes in memory of friend","story":"THREE students got on their bikes at John O\u0026rsquoGroats earlier this week and pointed their compasses to Land\u0026rsquos End in a bid to raise awareness about mental health.Fenn Newsome, Giles Themans and Alex Hayton decided upon the marathon pedal following the death of their friend and fellow Newcastle University student, Marcus Colville.Marcus, from Exeter, had tragically taken his own le last December. He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusFriday 21 Sep 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 21, 2018 at 2:00 pmA showcase event, aimed at promoting the sporting opportunities here in Orkney, is set to take place on Saturday.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Friday 21 Sep 2018 3:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The atmospheric walk is a magnet for visitors and local alike.The Avoch Primary School pupil\u0026rsquos mother Julie Mackay reported the \"nasty\" burglary on a community Facebook page prompting a run of comments \u0026ndash including some which suggested the culprits may have a problem with the natural area being studded with colourful wooden toy fairy houses.However, the effort to replace the items was considered a great success despite the dissident tone.Mrs Mackay , of High Street, Rosemarkie, said: \"We replaced the pink boot with the money that had been collected by the Panacea shop in Rosemarkie, which was around \u0026pound20. The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is probably one of the best kid\u0026#8217s movies ever made in an era of films that included Mary Poppins, Willy Wonka and The Sound of Music.                  The music from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang still gets me singing along every time I hear it.  But, it is the characters that made the movie so memorable.              My favourite character may surprise you.              No, it wasn’t Dick Van Dyke as Caractarus Pott.  It wasn’t Sally Ann Howes as Truly Scrumptious.  Not even Benny Hill as the Toymaker.  No, my favourite character was the Child Catcher played by Robert Helpmann. And I guess for many kids who watched this film, the child catcher was a sinister and scary man who not only looked awful, but just loved his job - at being awful.  However, there is more relevant point to the child catcher and why he helped Baron Bomburst rid the land of children.  And the older I get in this weird century we live in the more I yearn for the child catcher to come back to le...Kids nowadays are probably the worst behaved for a generation. Wouldn’t you agree?  Whether it be on planes, trains, restaurants or supermarkets, kids just have no idea how to behave themselves and keep quiet.  On airplanes kids kick the back of your seat constantly.  And on many tour operators these days the back of my seat is plastic, so the thud thud thud goes right through me.  Then they moan and gurn to their mummies asking for this and that.  If they don’t get it they ask why, why, why mummy....  They cannot take a telling and have no appreciation of no means no and keep quiet.  In fast food outlets and restaurants they climb on the seats, shout at mummy and daddy to give them this and that and throw food all over the place.  They whine for their tech and throw tantrums when things don’t go their way.  And you wonder why I want the child catcher reinstated?Or maybe I’m being unfair.  It is safe to say that I am a lot grumpier now as I age.  But, the little darlings grate even more on my nerves now not just because of my age.  They are most definitely louder, more raucous and less inclined to listen to their parents.  Ah yes....  maybe I have been too hard on the kiddies.  Maybe  we look a bit closer, we can see that they are simply a product of the people who brought them on to this planet.  Yes, 21st Century mummy and daddy who, on the whole, do not have a clue as to what parenting is all about.  Don’t get me wrong, there are some terric parents working very hard with their children to install manners and values within them.  It is admirable and long may it continue.  But, there is a large majority who either do not really care or do not have clue.I’m not going to fix this generation of badly behaved kids in this column.  Creating an army of child catchers would only lead to even bigger trouble ahead as they would all end up in borstals.  And that experiment did not end well.  Mind you it got rid of two bullies out my class at school!  No, locking the poor wee lambs away would only cause them longer term harm.  I’d rather ask you the question.  What do you do when a kid is blatantly being badly behaved and the parent is doing nothing to stop it, check it, intervene or even try?             I recently was on a plane where mummy and daddy walked on with three kids all under the age of seven.  As they walked on I could see the kids were hyper and saw the whole travel experience as a big adventure.  I prayed quickly that they would walk to the back of the plane.  But alas, my God was not listening and the wee beauties sat behind me, while mummy and daddy sat in the rows behind and opposite.  Within 40 minutes of the flight all three were arguing, shouting over to mummy and kicking lumps out my seat and the seats of the two elderly passengers in my row. We all looked at each other and my elderly neighbours rolled their eyes and shook their heads.  I’d had enough after 90 minutes and despite looking round was getting no joy from the parents.  Then I noticed that daddy was fast asleep. Yes, while we endured the torment of his offspring, he was grabbing forty winks uninterrupted. Swine....So, what would you have done in this situation?  Do you simply endure it and accept the fact that there is another hour and a half to go.  Bed in and try some mindfulness techniques.  Or do you attract the attention of the cabin crew who are far too busy selling food to create commission to make a wage?  Or, do you get up out your seat, and wake up daddy?  Who will either act responsibly or get all rowdy.  Will the other passengers support you as they have all noticed the kids behaviour?  Or will you be left on your own only to end up on the end of a mobile phone snippet sent to a tabloid depicting you as a grumpy passenger from hell?As it happens, I did nothing except shake me head with all the passengers seated around me who were all unhappy at the din.  Did I fail?  Or did I simply keep the peace?  Yes, kids nowadays are louder and in my opinion more needy.  But, we have a generation of parents who seem not to care and when challenged become defensive and even aggressive.  So we don’t bother even trying.             I wonder what you will do the next time you witness kid’s bad behaviour while their parents do nothing.  Is it not time to start speaking up?The child catcher character may be mythical.  But the problems we have these days with kids is real and only getting worse.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4803629.1537537381!/image/image.jpg","title":"in full theresa may s speech on brexit impasse","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Here is Prime Minister Theresa May\u0026#8217s speech in full:                “Yesterday, I was in Salzburg for talks with European leaders.            “I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight.            “While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that - despite the progress we have made - there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart.“The first is our economic relationship after we have left.“Here, the EU is still only offering us two options.“The first option would involve the UK staying in the European Economic Area and a customs union with the EU.“In plain English, this would mean we’d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn’t do the trade deals we want with other countries.            “That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago.• : Theresa May makes statement after EU leaders reject Brexit plan“The second option would be a basic free trade agreement for Great Britain that would introduce checks at the Great Britain/EU border.  But even worse, Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the Customs Union and parts of the Single Market, permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea.            “Parliament has already - unanimously - rejected this idea.“Creating any form of customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would not respect that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, in line with the principle of consent, as set out clearly in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.“It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to.  If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.“Anything which fails to respect the referendum or which effectively ides our country in two would be a bad deal and I have always said no deal is better than a bad deal.“But I have also been clear that the best outcome is for the UK to leave with a deal.  That is why, following months of intensive work and detailed discussions, we proposed a third option for our future economic relationship, based on the frictionless trade in goods.  That is the best way to protect jobs here and in the EU and to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, while respecting the referendum result and the integrity of the United Kingdom.            “Yesterday Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market.  He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal.  So we are at an impasse.“The second issue is connected to the first.  We both agree that the Withdrawal Agreement needs to include a backstop to ensure that  there’s a delay in implementing our new relationship, there still won’t be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.• : Theresa May has Brexit Chequers plan rejected by EU leaders“But the EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union.“As I have already said, that is unacceptable.  We will never agree to it.  It would mean breaking up our country.“We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK.  And it will be in line with the commitments we made back in December - including the commitment that no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.“As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other.“We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs.“We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens.“Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect.  The UK expects the same.  A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.“At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.“So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are and what their alternative is so that we can discuss them.  Until we do, we cannot make progress.“In the meantime, we must and will continue the work of preparing ourselves for no deal.“In particular, I want to clary our approach to two issues.“First, there are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday’s summit means for their future.• : Ruth Davidson says Tory rebels must back ‘remarkable’ Theresa May“I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected.  You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues.  We want you to stay.“Second, I want to reassure the people of Northern Ireland that in the event of no deal we will do everything in our power to prevent a  to a hard border.“Let me also say this.“The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone.  To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy.“That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU.“I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.“No one wants a good deal more than me.“But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country.“We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations.  We stand ready.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4803514.1537531375!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond allegations no details of contact with sturgeon to be released","story":"        The Scottish Government is refusing to ulge whether it holds details of contact between Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon over the sexual harassment claims which have rocked Scottish politics.

Customers started reporting problems at around 5am on Friday and a statement issued later that morning by the bank said the issues had been resolved.            : RBS to pay first i in a decadeThe issues had affected NatWest, Ulster Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland customers.The latest disruption came just a day after Barclays customers were left struggling to log in. Those issues have also now been fixed.A statement from RBS said: “We would like to apologise to customers who experienced issues logging into their online and mobile banking accounts this morning, this issue has now been resolved.”Meanwhile, HSBC is carrying out routine essential maintenance this Sunday which means its mobile banking app and online banking will be unavailable for personal customers for a period in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Theresa May has had her Brexit strategy comprehensively rejected by EU leaders, who sent her away with an ultimatum to rewrite her plans within four weeks.                It leaves Mrs May with little defence from circling Brexiteers in her own party, with just over a week until the Conservative conference.            : Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis slams Theresa May’s Chequers planDowning Street had expected the 27 other EU leaders gathered in Austria to limit their criticism of her plans in order to shore up the Prime Minister’s position, with fears of a no-deal Brexit growing.            But Mr Tusk dashed any hopes of a reprieve, saying after a working lunch to discuss the UK’s plans: “Everybody shared the view that while there are positive elements in the Chequers proposal, the suggested framework for economic co-operation will not work, not least because it is undermining the single market.”He said the “moment of truth” in the negotiations would now come at the next full European Council ­meeting in October, when it will be decided whether to hold a special summit in November to finalise the withdrawal agreement.European leaders were equally blunt, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying the EU27 were agreed that, “in the matter of the single market, there can be no compromises”.French President Emmanuel Macron said there was “consensus” that the UK’s proposals were “not acceptable”.The Chequers plan could not be regarded as a “take it or leave it” offer, Mr Macron said, adding that he hoped there would be “new British propositions” on the table by October.            But in a warning of the growing risk of the UK leaving the EU without a Brexit agreement, the French President said there must be “no blind deal” that fails to set out a clear outline of the future relationship.And he issued a harsh assessment of Brexiteers who he said “predicted easy solutions”.\u2028“Those people are liars,” Mr Macron said. “They left the next day so they didn’t have to manage it.”After what she described as a “frank” meeting with Mr Tusk, Mrs May – who was not present at yesterday’s lunch –insisted that the plan drawn up at her country residence in July remains “the only serious and credible proposition on the table” for resolving the issue of the Irish border.She has flatly rejected a European Commission backstop proposal for Northern Ireland to remain within the EU customs area after Brexit, arguing that this would draw a border down the Irish Sea.            The Prime Minister said a solution for the border “cannot ide the United Kingdom into two customs territories”.“On the economic partnership, there is no solution that will resolve the Northern Ireland border which is not based on the frictionless movement of goods,” she said.But at a press conference in which she appeared visibly angry, Mrs May said the UK would “shortly” be coming forward with new proposals for the backstop at the border.Mr Tusk said: “In October we expect maximum progress and results in the Brexit talks and then we will decide whether conditions are there to call an extra summit in November to finalise and formalise the deal.He added: “Today I am a little more optimistic when it comes to a positive outcome of our negotiations.            “Unfortunately we cannot at this stage exclude a no-deal - it depends on both sides of negotiations.”European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker sounded nonchalant about the mounting possibility of a no-deal Brexit, saying: “The Commission has prepared in detail all for all the consequences of a no deal. So don’t worry. Be happy, don’t worry.”: Jeremy Corbyn: Labour could grant second independence referendumThe Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists: “I think we have made more preparations for no deal than the United Kingdom.”Labour’s Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer called on Mrs May to abandon her opposition to the UK remaining in the European single market. “It has been clear for weeks that Theresa May’s Chequers’ proposals cannot deliver the comprehensive plan we need to protect jobs, the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland,” he said.“With just weeks to go until a deal must be struck, the Prime Minister cannot keep ignoring this reality. She needs to urgently drop her reckless red lines and put forward a credible plan for Brexit.”In a letter to opposition leaders at Westminster, Nicola Sturgeon yesterday called for the Brexit timetable to be extended in the event that no deal is reached, to “avoid an economic clf edge”.The Scottish First Minister said she was issuing an “urgent reality check”, warning: “It’s time for everyone in the UK political establishment to wake up to the reality of what now faces us.“If the choice we face is between no deal and no detail, then an extension to the Article 50 negotiation period must be on the table as the only way to avoid an economic clf edge, and allow all alternative options to be considered.”But Ms Sturgeon insisted it “seems increasingly likely” that the statement setting out the future relationship between the UK and the EU “will be vague and lacking in meaningful detail”.The First Minister said: “A no-deal Brexit will, by the UK government’s own admission, lead to dire economic consequences and a shortage of medicines and foodstuffs.“Meanwhile, a ‘blind’ Brexit will simply kick all of the dficult decisions into the long grass –but with the UK already out of the EU. Not only would that continue the uncertainty, it would be tantamount to stepping off a clf edge blindfolded, with no idea of what the landing place will be.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what,  any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.\nTo be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.  Next day, the same inidual was identied at 0800hrs heading north through Yell Sound.\nSome of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.\nCommon heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise.

minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards

the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a

have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8633378.1536767392!/image/image.jpg","title":"international sheepdog trial was a tail wagging success","story":"\nThousands of local, national and international visitors descended on Dromore\u0026#8217s Gill Hall Estate for the International Sheepdog Trial 2018\n\n                \nMore than 600 dogs and 300 top handlers from the UK and Ireland went through their paces to secure a place for the competitive three-day event.

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

After being put on hold other people arrived to help. \n\n\"He wasn\u0027t alert and I wasn\u0027t sure what was happening,\" Catherine said. \n\n\"I was quite scared, this was a young boy and he needed help, when I rang for help there was no answer, there was nobody there at the end of the line to help. \n\n\n\n\"Someone put him in the recovery position and kept him calm. I thought it might be a problem with my phone so I ran across the road to a local business and they also rang 999 and got the same message.\n\n\"On this occasion the patient is fine but you just wonder what  it was something else, what  someone had seriously been injured. When you ring 999 you want to be sure someone will be there.\n\nCatherine said once her call was answered the ambulance arrived quickly and the staff \"absolutely brilliant\".\n\n\"I think it\u0027s really scary, I mean who do you call when you need help? It could have been a child choking, it could have been a road traffic accident. It could have been someone on their own crying out for help and 12 minutes is a long time to wait for someone to help you,\" Catherine added. \n\nBrian McNeill, director of operations for the Ambulance Service told the Nolan Show he was \"embarrassed and very disappointed\". He stressed that should anyone have to wait after calling 999 they should not hang up and try again as this would put them at the back of the queue.\n\n\"This is totally unacceptable, we failed the person who made the call and the patient. We are doing a full investigation to ensure it doesn\u0027t happen again.\"\n\nIn a statement the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service apologised to Catherine for the incident.\n\n\"We apologise to the patient for the unacceptable delay in sending them an ambulance,\" the statement read.\n\nThe NIAS confirmed that Catherine queued for 12 minutes and said that they have a \"call queue because on occasion calls outnumber the call takers available to answer them\".\n\n\"We have ious contingencies in place in the event that there are more of those calls coming in than we can take.\n\n\"When we have calls queueing we allow our callers to complete other calls quickly and we also have a buddy system with the Scottish Ambulance Service where the calls that are queued here can be answered by one of them and vice versa.\n\n\"There has clearly been a failure in our contingency system and we are now in the process of completing an investigation.\"   \n"},{"url":null,"title":"dont be bullied by brussels into a compromise on the border dups dodds urges prime minister","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

That is the absolute priority for us.\"\n\nMrs May remains wedded to her Brexit plan despite being told it \"will not work\" at a summit of European Union leaders.\n\nThe Prime Minister said her Chequers blueprint is the only proposal on the table as the deadline approaches, with the next leaders\u0027 meeting in October set to be a \"moment of truth\".\n\nBut she indicated the UK will unveil new measures on the future status of the Irish border in a bid to break the deadlock.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the two-day EU summit in Austria - during which she had a meeting with Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar - Mrs May said the UK will \"shortly\" come forward with new proposals on the so-called \"backstop\" arrangements for implementation at the border  no long-term solution is found.\n\nShe said she is working towards an October date but privately told Mr Varadkar she did not think she could have proposals on the backstop ready for then. At their bilateral she was told time is running short and was pressed to bring forward her alternative as soon as possible.\n\nBut Mr Dodds warned: \"Amid some speculation coming out of Salzburg about border issues, people need to remember that the December Joint Report, which is the basis for the so-called backstop through Article 49, also contained an explicit commitment in Article 50. \"This states that the United Kingdom will ensure that no new regulatory barriers develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\" \n\nOne possible concession revealed by the Independent could see customs compliance checks away from Irish Sea ports, but not regulatory checks. The EU has also suggested that \"most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets\".\n\nThe combination of concessions - with Britain accepting regulatory checks at ports and the EU moving some customs checks in-land - appears to clear the path for a potential solution.\n\nHowever, DUP leader Arlene Foster has said previously that trade barriers put up between Northern Ireland Great Britain is a red line for her.\n\nSpeaking after a meeting with European Council president Donald Tusk, the PM said: \"We both agree there can be no withdrawal agreement without a legally-operative backstop. But that backstop cannot ide the United Kingdom into two customs territories, and we will be bringing forward our own proposals shortly.\n\n\"On the economic partnership, there is no solution that will resolve the Northern Ireland border which is not based on the frictionless movement of goods. Our White Paper remains the only serious and credible proposition on the table for achieving that objective.\"\n\nMr Varadkar didn\u0027t want to comment on potential UK concessions without having anything in writing, but spoke of \"there being verbal briefings and being promised that certain things would happen then when the documents arrive they are not quite what we expected...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"fionola meredith its not easy when our children head off to university but flying the family nest is the natural thing to do","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

If that sounds melodramatic, wait until you witness it for yourself. It\u0027s an eye-opener, for all concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe farewell ritual is similar for many families. First, the drawers and wardrobes of teenage bedrooms are stripped bare as an unfeasible amount of clothes, shoes, games consoles, books, posters and other precious possessions are crammed into suitcases and boxes, to be sealed with parcel tape and marked with a strange new address. The carpet, long unseen because it\u0027s usually covered with unwashed jeans, empty cereal bowls and cast-off pizza boxes, may gradually re-emerge as everything gets packed away.\n\nThen there\u0027s the inevitable trip to Ikea for towels, duvet covers and cheap kitchen supplies, which to your son or daughter\u0027s mind may well include vital essentials such as a cocktail-making kit.\n\nAfter that, there\u0027s the journey by sea or air to the English, Scottish or Welsh university where they will spend most of the next three years, far away, on their own, over the water. There will be the swt unpacking, and maybe a last dinner together. It\u0027s disorienting to see all their familiar stuff arranged in a new room, a new city. And then before you know it, you\u0027ve had the tearful goodbye hugs , you\u0027ve doled out the last words of advice, and you\u0027re back on the plane or the ferry, travelling home without them.\n\nWhen you get home, you go to their room, which is shockingly silent and bare, and there you finally see it: the empty nest.\n\nAnd you know what? That\u0027s a good thing. You have done your job, the one you\u0027ve been working at since they were born, 18 years ago. You have raised an independent, self-sufficient human being who can go out into the world and create a le for him or herself. \n\nIt\u0027s not easy for parents, of course. Some - especially mothers, I suspect, though fathers are often startled to find themselves deeply affected too - find the process of accepting that their child has reached maturity very dficult indeed, to the extent that they become seriously depressed: this is the so-called empty nest syndrome. The pain of letting go is understandable. In fact, it would be strange  it didn\u0027t hurt. But it is a necessary process of adjustment for all concerned, both parents and children.\n\nI do think the wrench is more challenging for parents whose youngsters choose to go across the water for third-level education. \n\nThis year, according to the latest UCAS figures, 4,950 school-leavers from Northern Ireland are beginning university in Britain this September, with 9,120 enrolling in universities here. \n\nMy son went to university in Dublin, and while I missed him badly, I consoled myself with the thought that at least he was still on the island. But four years later, when my daughter accepted a place at an English university, I had to reconcile myself to the physical barrier of the Irish Sea between me and my youngest. I fully supported her choice, but she seemed that much further away.\n\nThe plane ride back to Belfast, after we left her at her new halls of residence, was the hardest part. Three of us had gone out there, but only two of us were coming home. \n\nBut le soon settles into a new rhythm, only now with enhanced opportunities for parental city breaks, as well as other pleasant freedoms. And because university terms are relatively short, it\u0027s never long before they are back again, blowing into the house like a hurricane, bringing with them a blast of fresh air from the wider world. It\u0027s exciting to see how they have changed and grown, even after a short time, revelling in their new-found sense of independence.\n\nIt is customary to deplore the annual exodus of young people to British universities as some kind of lamentable \u0027brain drain\u0027. That\u0027s far too simplistic. It assumes that only the most intellectually gted students leave Northern Ireland, or that they are only departing because they have no alternative, since there isn\u0027t the same range of courses and opportunities here. \n\nIn reality, our children fly the family nest because that\u0027s the right and natural thing to do. Some fly further than others, it\u0027s true, but they go because the time has come for them to try out their wings. All we can do is watch and marvel as they soar away.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"loyalists suing state claiming their internment to balance the numbers","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

west Belfast woman and around 20 Protestant men are all suing the UK state over their internment during the Troubles, it emerged on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nEvelyn Gilroy\u0027s legal action is to be grouped with the so-called loyalist cases in all future reviews at the High Court.\n\nA judge was told one of the claims they were unlawfully imprisoned without trial is now at an advanced stage.\n\nMr Justice Maguire has now asked lawyers to identy all writs issued in connection with the policy.\n\nHe said: \"I will initiate a review relating a group which I will call internment cases.\"  \n\nDetention without trial was introduced in 1971 as the conflict raged in Northern Ireland.\n\nNearly 2,000, most of them Catholic, were held over the next four years.\n\nClaims have been brought against the Northern Ireland Office, PSNI, Ministry of Defence and Secretary of State.\n\nMs Gilroy alleges she was subjected to inhuman conditions during her arrest and imprisonment in May 1974.\n\nShe was held for three days in an RUC station before being transferred to Armagh prison where she was held until Christmas that year, according to her claim.\n\nInternment had been introduced as the conflict raged in Northern Ireland.\n\nNearly 2,000 people, most of them Catholic, were held without trial between 1971 and 1975.\n\nMs Gilroy is seeking damages for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment, negligence, breach of statutory duty and misfeasance in public office.\n\nIn court today it emerged that writs issued by around 20 men from the other side of the community are continuing.\n\nThey claim the British Government abused its power by locking them up in a bid to balance mass Catholic internment.\n\nOne of that group was arrested in 1973 and spent more than a year in custody.\n\nTheir case includes allegations they were interned because of their religion, in order to demonstrate the British state was not just detaining Catholics under that system.\n\nMore than 300 people were initially held in what was then called the Long Kesh prison camp outside Lisburn, County Antrim.\n\nThey were accused of involvement with the IRA.\n\nIt would take another 18 months before anyone from a loyalist background was interned.\n\nBarrister Paul McLaughlin, for the authorities being sued, confirmed as many as 21 legal actions have been commenced.\n\n\"Most are loyalists who say there was an unlawful policy to intern them from 1973,\" he told the court.\n\nEugene McKenna, representing Ms Gilroy, predicted the same discovery would be required in all the cases.\n\nHe added: \"This plaintf  is the only matter with proceedings issued who was a member of the nationalist population at that time.\"\n\nFollowing submissions Mr Justice Maguire agreed to group all the actions together for future, regular reviews. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic culture night road closures","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Independent Senator Ronan Mullen was the only one to express opposition to the referendum, labelling the vote as tokenism.\n\nHe hit out at the proposal as hypocritical, adding that anti-Catholicism is a bizarre version of free speech.\n\nHis suggestion was that the 2009 Defamation Act be amended to remove the offence of blasphemy from Irish law, adding it would reduce the cost of another referendum on taxpayers.\n\nHe claimed the referendum could cost the taxpayer between €3m and €4m.\n\nThe last known complaint of blasphemy in Ireland was in 2017, when Garda were looking into a formal complaint of blasphemy made against Stephen Fry and RTE after the writer’s 2015 appearance on RTE’s religion programme The Meaning Of Le.\n\nThe Garda later said they would not proceed with an investigation as no injured parties had come forward and they were “unable to find a substantial number of outraged people”.\n\nMr Murphy encouraged the public to engage in the referendum, no matter what their belief on the matter.\n\n“Whatever your views are on the proposals in the referendum, can I take this opportunity to encourage voters to go to their polling station during this 15 hour period on 26 October and have your say in the outcome of the referendum”, the minister said.\n\nHe has appointed Barry Ryan, a Principal Officer in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, to be the referendum ing officer for the referendum.\n\nThe total Irish electorate stands at around 3.3 million.\n\nPolling will take place between 7am and 10pm.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"first driverless bus arrives in dublin","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Ireland’s first driverless shuttle has arrived in The Docklands. If you’d like to take a ride in it, there are still some tickets available at \nhttps:t.co/ijL4RqeryU\n… \n#SmartDocklands\n \n@smartdublin\n \n@CivicGroup\n \n@connect_ie\n \n@DubCityCouncil\n \npic.twitter/KPqzfS2zDu\n\n— Smart Docklands  \nSeptember 21, 2018\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped in 2014, the EasyMile showcases autonomous vehicle technology and operates in countries around the world including the US, the Netherlands, China and Estonia. \n\nIt features a built-in access ramp for passengers with reduced mobility as well as cameras, processors and sensors, and integrates with existing traffic. \n\nUsing GPS and articial intelligence to operate, the bus can read road signs and sense cars and cyclists on the road. \n\nNeil Cunningham, chief executive of Civic Group, said: “We wanted to bring this to the city to show the public what’s coming down the line and where we are going to be in five to 10 years’ time.\n\n\n\n#FutureMobility\n \n#SmartMobility\n \"Dublin City Council, as part of its \n@SmartDocklands\n project, and in partnership with the \n@CivicGroup\n ,will bring a glimpse of the future of smart and sustainable transport to Dublin.\" \n@DubCityCouncil\n \n@connect_ie\n \n@jcudden\n \n@smartdublin\n \n@jesskellynt\n \npic.twitter/yc39HrBb6n\n\n— Civic Group  \nSeptember 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“There is currently no legislation in Ireland that will allow fully autonomous vehicles on the roads so that law needs to change and it will. \n\n“We are looking at setting up some test beds with University College Dublin  and other campuses in order to prove the technology, and once it’s proven, which will take three to five years, and legislation is passed, then we will be able to put them on the roads and integrate them with other vehicles.\n\n“We want to show the public what it’s about, to touch and feel it and understand that this is what is coming down the line and not to be afraid of it.\n\n“Take one journey on it and you will be convinced.\n\n“At the moment people who can’t get to their workplace using public transport bring their car, so the idea is it will pick people up in certain areas and bring them to bus terminals, and a larger bus will bring them into the city and then the EasyMile will then take them on their last mile.\n\n“People don’t have to bring their car because they have a form of transport right to the door.\n\n“It will free up lanes for bikes as there will be fewer cars in the road.”\n\nClement Delbouys, spokesman for the French company that developed the shuttle bus, said the idea is to operate the first and last mile for the public. \n\n\nVisiting the \n#IAA18\n?

statement to cameras at 10 Downing Street.\n\nThe move comes after European Council President Donald Tusk ripped up Mrs May’s blueprint for Brexit on Thursday, saying it risked the integrity of the EU single market and the Northern Ireland border.\n\nKey EU leaders including Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron also said signicant progress was needed by the European Council summit on October 18  agreement on the UK’s withdrawal deal was to be reached.\n\nMrs May has indicated that she will come forward “shortly” with new proposals on the thorny issue of the Irish border, which has emerged as the main obstacle to progress.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab earlier vented his frustration over the Salzburg summit, accusing EU leaders of putting “the handbrake” on negotiations.\n\nMr Raab, appearing on the BBC’s Politics Live, said: “We’ve been rebuffed on our plans without any coherent explanation as to why, there’s these sort of rather dogmatic pleas to the single market unity but our plans were very carefully crafted around that.”\n\nHe added: “We’re going to hold our nerve, stay calm and keep negotiating in good faith.\n\n“We’ve revved up the motor of these negotiations, I’ve been out there a lot more frequently to get motoring, to make progress and the EU have just yanked up the handbrake and for the negotiations to go forward they’re going to have to take their hand off the handbrake.”\n\nMr Raab also criticised Donald Tusk for posting a picture on social media of himself offering the Prime Minister a cake with the caption “sorry, no cherries”.\n\nHe said: “I think some of the way that it was done, social media against the Prime Minister didn’t feel like very statesman-like behaviour.”\n\nThe Brexit Secretary went on to praise Mrs May, telling the BBC that she was “a very stoic, resilient character”.\n\nHe added: “There’s a big question mark about whether the EU is really serious about the substance of these negotiations.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"offshore workers to be balloted on industrial action","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

the OCA agreement firmly rejected the revised pay offer in July.\n\n“Unite members fully deserve a basic pay increase of 4% for the part they have played over a number of years in ing North Sea operators to be competitive once again after the downturn.\n\n“The North Sea operators, paymasters of the OCA companies, have now ed to very healthy balance sheets and it’s only just that our members share in these rewards.\n\n“Unite now has no option but to ballot our members for industrial action but we hope the OCA companies come to their senses and  to the negotiating table with an offer which meets the reasonable demands of our members.”\n\nNegotiations with the OCA have been going on since January this year.\n\nThe OCA represents contractor companies involved in a range of activities in the UK’s offshore oil and gas industry.\n\nPaul Atkinson, Offshore Contractors Association chief executive, said: “We have worked very closely with Trade Union officials to create a sustainable employment model that provides the workforce with greater stability whilst also improving the utilisation of resources.\n\n“We are disappointed Unite has decided to ballot their members for industrial action but it’s important to remember that our offer remains on the table.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"this guys goal celebration took a dramatic turn when he cleared the hoardings","story":"\n Hi

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

premises in Belfast city centre by early next year in a move that will see the current tenant quit its home of more than 10 years.\n\n                \n\nNI NEWS: \n\n\nRBAI flies flag at half-mast

which is also listed.\n\nThe move comes amid growing speculation about the future of the business in Belfast almost a month since fire ripped through the Bank Buildings and reduced the  old building to a shell.\n\nHowever, according to  information gathered by the News Letter, it requires Primark, which acquired Fountain House just over a year ago to serve notice on New Look which is understood to be in themiddle of a 20-year lease that began in 2007.\n\nThat followed an extensive refit and renovation carried out in 2006.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nNew Look, which has three other Belfast stores in CastleCourt on Royal Avenue, Cityside on York Street and Connswater off the Newtownards Road, did nor respond to a request for comment.\n\nHowever,a Primark spokesperson declined to either confirm or deny the plan, repeating the firm’s previous position: “It is our intention to be back up and trading again as soon possible. \n\n“We are at the early stages on this and will confirm details as soon as possible.”\n\nFountain House is a B1 listed building and feature three floors of retail space and one for storage.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was offered for sale last March for £14.25 million by then owners M\u0026ampG Property Portfolio, which bought the building for £13.4m in August 2014.\n\nHowever, while the move would restore Primark’s position in a prime spot, it still leaves the city centre in a parlous position in the run up to Christmas, with 14 stores remaining closed behind the cordon around Bank Buildings and countless other impacted by the cordon and the resulting fall in visitors to the city centre since the fire on August 28.\n\nIn addition to confirming it will pay staff up to the new year, Primark last week announced it is to donate £500,000 to a support fund set up to help fellow traders.\n\nAs yet there has been no indication as to whether it will be possible to stablilise and rebuild the shell or whether it will have to be demolished and replaced .\n\nIncreasingly concerned traders have been warned by Belfast City Council that the cordon could remain in place until early next year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n

love\u0027\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimark ‘set to move into New Look premises by new year’\n\n\n\nMr Varadkar said he was determined to keep working to secure an agreement and avoid a clf-edge scenario next March.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe Taoiseach made the comments following a two-day summit of European leaders in Austria to discuss the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.\n\nMr Varadkar held a meeting with Theresa May at the summit in Salzburg where the Prime Minister said the UK would be coming forward with new proposals on the so-called backstop arrangements on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in a bid to break the deadlock.\n\nSpeaking from the National Ploughing Championships in Screggan, Co Offaly, Mr Varadkar said: \"I think we can have a deal.\n\n\"I think we\u0027re entering into a rocky patch over the next couple of weeks but I\u0027m determined to keep working and to secure that deal that we need before the end of the year... ideally in October or November.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe denied there was any ision among the European Union leaders about the matter.\n\n\"There is a sense created perhaps in the UK press that there was ision around the table among the European Union, among the 27,\" Mr Varadkar said.\n\n\"There was not.\"\n\nMr Varadkar said the EU was \"totally united\", not just behind Ireland but behind protecting the integrity of the single market.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Perhaps a sense was created that Prime Minister May would come away with something more positive than occurred but I don\u0027t think anyone in the European Union or Ireland is to blame for that.\n\n\"Ultimately the problems that are being created by Britain and the British Government are being created as a consequence of Brexit.\"\n\nMr Varadkar added that Mrs May\u0027s Chequers proposal could form a useful \"input\" into the talks but there were \"obvious problems\" with it.\n\n\n\nRBAI flies flag at half-mast after sudden deaths of two

Northern Ireland coastguard had to rescue three yachts that got into dficulty during Storm Ali on Wednesday.\n\n                \nThe volunteer crew members were alerted at 11.40am on Wednesday to go the aid of a stricken yacht at Newtownards Sailing Club on Strangford Lough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe Northern Ireland coastguard came to the rescue of three yachts during Storm Ali.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe all-weather leboat under Coxswain William Chambers, launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs the leboat launched, it quickly became apparent the challenging weather conditions the crew were going to face on their passage to Newtownards.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nShortly after launching the Coxswain requested the main water tight doors to be closed and all crew to be seated as they now faced eight metre waves hitting from the side.\n\nThere was a force eight gale blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough. Some 90 minutes later the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.\n\nOn arrival at Newtownards Yacht Club at 2.15pm, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but when the leboat crew came alongside it was confirmed that nobody had been on the boat and she was safely on the mooring.\n\nThe leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from White Rock and Kircubbin but unfortunately by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to the station, and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nOn leaving the sheltered waters of Strangford Lough the leboat and its crew once again faced mountainous seas and the Coxswain decided to stop in Ardglass marina for an hour to let the wind decrease and the wave size drop.\n\nLeaving Ardglass marina around 6:00pm the crew faced large but bearable seas making it back to Newcastle, Co. Down for 7:00pm.\n\nSpeaking after spending over seven hours at sea, Newcastle RNLI Coxswain William Chambers said: \"This was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"It was also uncertain at that point  there was a le at risk on-board the yacht, thankfully there wasn’t in this case. It was a long and challenging day but our volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.\"\n\n                            \n            \n
