That’s what this competition is about.’He added: ‘You take it to dizzy heights that stirs emotion.’And stir emotion it did.And the response was amazing.When announcing the three finalists, David, Kenny and Nawamin viewers were floored once more when John nearly teared up a second time.The heightened emotions had everyone on edge, it seemed, when one viewer said: ‘John Torode getting emotional when announcing the Masterchef final three nearly broke me.’If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/concordia-header.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"5 worst things happened friday 13th","story":"Luxury cruise ship Costa Concordia overturned after hitting an Italian reef on Friday 13th (Picture: AP PhotoGregorio Borgia)Friday 13th is not a day to be messed with, and we’re not just saying that because we’re wimps.History offers plenty of evidence that bad things happen on this doom-laden date, some of them so bad that they’ve fanned the flames of the world’s oddest superstition.And while the origin of this strange date is not crystal clear, its ‘effects’ have had an irreparable, negative impact on people’s lives.So without further ado, here are the five (listing the top 13 is not advisable today) worst things that have happened on Friday 13th.On Friday 13 October 1972, a plane full of Uruguayan rugby players crashed into the snowy Chilean mountains.Only 27 of the original 45 passengers survived, and without supplies, those still alive had to eat their dead teammates.A few weeks later, an avalanche killed eight more. The 16 remaining survivors were not rescued until the end of December. Grim.And on the same day of that plane crash, October 13, a plane in Moscow crashed into the ground, killing all 174 on board.On Friday 13 January 2012, a huge cruise ship called the Costa Concordia capsized off the Tuscan coast near Isola del Giglio after it struck a reef and began to tilt.Thirty-two people died (and possibly more due to the fact some unregistered people were aboard). The captain of the ship was found guilty of manslaughter for not evacuating passengers properly.The cost of the rescue and clear-up was £1.4 billion, more than three times the £430 million construction bill for the ship.On Friday 13 March 1964, 28-year-old Kitty Genovese was brutally raped and murdered in front of a New York block of flats.The crime is infamous because according to reports, more than 30 people witnessed the crime at their windows, without one person intervening or calling the police.This event gave its name to the psychological phenomena Genovese syndrome (aka bystander effect), which happens when people fail to do the right thing if they’re in a crowd.On Friday 13 November 1970, a cyclone hit Bangladesh, causing a tidal wave and eventually killing around 500,000 people.Livestock were wiped out, as were crops in hundreds of fields, meaning the disaster also caused mass starvation for a long period afterwards.Friday 13 1939 saw the beginning of the worst bushfire in history, now known as the Black Friday bushfires.In Victoria, Australia, almost 20,000 km² (nearly 5 million acres) of land was turned to ash, 1,300 home were burned down and 71 people died.Several towns were totally destroyed, and three quarters of the state of Victoria was affected, giving the appearance that the whole area had been cursed during the blaze.MORE: Arctic Monkeys tickets are released this morning – when, where and at what price?MORE: Is the new God of War game open world?"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_7163953.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"russian ships depart key naval base syria ahead us airstrikes","story":"Dramatic satellite images have emerged showing Russian warships departing a key naval base in Syria  (Picture: @imagesatintTwitter)Dramatic satellite images have emerged showing Russian warships departing a key naval base in Syria amid fears of possible US airstrikes. The images appear to show at least 11 navy vessels leaving the Tartus military port on the Syrian coast.Russia is said to be responding to Donald Trump’s threat to ‘get ready’ for missile strikes in Syria earlier this week.The Kremlin threatened to shoot down any rockets launched at them, but it appears as though they may be cowering to the US threats.The images appear to show at least 11 navy vessels leaving the Tartus military port on the Syrian coast.  (Picture: @imagesatintTwitter)Trump and a number of Western allies are considering taking action following a horrifying chemical attack on a Syrian rebel-held town which left at least 40 dead.It is not known exactly why the ships have been moved but some believe the vessels are simply on a training exercise or that they are getting prepared to intercept missiles.The first of the images, produced by satellite imaging and intelligence firm ISI, are thought to have been taken before the gas attack in Douma on Saturday.Last night, Yevgeny Serebrennikov, the first deputy chairman of the Russian upper house’s defence committee, told Russian media that Russia’s troops in Syria were being protected.He said: ‘The Russian military bases in Hmeymim and Tartus are under firm protection.‘At the same time, we expect that in the event of US strikes, if any, the lives of our servicemen will not be in danger.‘I think that the United States understands this and will not allow it, because otherwise, Russia’s response will be immediate.’The two leaders said there was a need ‘to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime’, as they pledged to work together on the international response to the suspected chemical weapons attack.Ministers have said it is ‘highly likely’ Syrian President Bashar Assad was responsible for the attack on Saturday’North Korean defectors tell their stories of escape and heartbreakRussia has been granted a request for the United Nations Security Council to meet on Friday for fresh discussions on the threat to international peace from air strikes on Syria.MORE: Parents jailed after raping daughter and saying ‘better us than some maniac’MORE: Incest dad kills baby he had with his own daughter then murders her and her adoptive father"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/21/4B0ECAC000000578-0-image-m-119_1523480051131.jpg","title":"Netflix pulls Cannes Film Festival following ban films not released cinemas","story":"    Netflix says it is totally pulling out of the Cannes Film Festival in France (pictured) next month after their refusal to allow films not released to cinemas to competeNetflix will not participate as a non-competitor, Sarandos told Variety. \u0027I don\u0027t think there would be any reason to go out of competition.

Funnily enough, Zuckerberg’s own (open) Facebook page gives us a very good idea . . .Tycoon in trainingZuckerberg lists his childhood home as Dobbs Ferry, a commuter town just outside New York where he grew up one of four children of a psychiatrist called Karen and a dentist called Edward, whose nickname was ‘the Painless Dr Z’ and who worked from a surgery attached to the family home.Facebook finally gets in touch with Diamond and Silk a day...Is that you, Data? Twitter users go wild comparing Mark...Share this articleEdward, whose website boasts ‘we cater for cowards’, introduced Mark to computer programming at the age of 11. Within 12 months, he’d created a program that alerted his father when a patient had walked into the waiting room.While at boarding school, computer prodigy Mark then wrote a program that would recommend music to a user based on previous songs or albums they had listened to. Microsoft caught wind of it and offered to buy it, but he turned them down. He also turned down a lucrative job offer from the tech giant AOL in order to go to Harvard to study psychology and computer science. The rest, as they say, is history.College social climberThe creation of Facebook was, of course, chronicled in the hit film The Social Network, which portrays ‘Zuck’ as an insecure social climber who brutally dispensed with friends who helped build the company in its early days.Ironically, the movie’s writer, Aaron Sorkin, was once listed as one of Zuckerberg’s favourite film-makers. The endorsement vanished from the young tycoon’s Facebook page around the time the unflattering film came out.          Power couple: Mark and Priscilla married a day after the share offer that made them billionairesFor those who haven’t seen it, the movie tells how Facebook was originally designed in a university bedroom. Its purpose was to allow leering, male Harvard students to rate female peers in order of their attractiveness.One co-founder, a fellow student called Eduardo Saverin, ran the enterprise’s commercial side. But he was cruelly frozen out when Zuckerberg dropped out to run the site full-time. After a lengthy legal battle, Saverin got around £750 million in compensation.Also dispensed with were Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, fellow undergraduates who hired Zuckerberg to program a dating website and claimed key features of their idea were then stolen and used on Facebook. They received a reported £43 million in an out-of-court settlement.Chez ZuckerbergZuckerberg moved directly to Silicon Valley after dropping out of Harvard.His journey up the local property ladder has been avidly chronicled via his own website ever since, with the billionaire sharing regular behind-the-scenes images of his comparatively modest domestic set-up.For several years, he rented a four-bedroom house in a leafy suburb of Palo Alto — a wealthy city adjacent to San Francisco where almost every major internet firm is based — for a (by local standards) paltry £3,500 a month.          Wild: Zuckerberg and his wife and daughter in Where The Wild Things Are costumes (shown)He also drove a beaten-up Honda Acura, on the grounds that it was ‘safe, comfortable, not ostentatious’.Finally, in 2011, he became a homeowner, spending £4 million on a two-storey, five-bedroom property ten minutes from Facebook’s head office (where he typically works for 60-70 hours a week).He also upgraded his car to a Volkswagen Golf GTI, which he drives to company HQ at 8am in order to attend daily sessions with a personal trainer.The house is fashionably decorated, with wooden floors, beige carpets, and (famously) not a single television set.It’s a pretty humble abode for one of the world’s wealthiest men and supporters of Zuckerberg invariably like to observe that he has no time for the gated mansions and mega-yachts of other, more brash billionaires.What they usually fail to mention is that Zuckerberg also spent a punchy £21 million buying up all of the neighbouring houses that overlook his oh-so-humble home and its garden. And in 2014, he dropped another £75 million buying up 750 acres of the idyllic Hawaiian island of Kauai, in order — one assumes — to one day build a proper Bond -villain-style residence.The doctor wife          Zuckerberg jokes around about hard workAside from his trillion-dollar tech firm, Zuckerberg’s wife, Priscilla Chan, is the other great legacy of his stint at Harvard. The couple met one Friday night during a beer-fuelled party at the all-male ‘fraternity house’ where Mark lived. ‘He was this nerdy guy who was just a little bit out there,’ recalled ‘Cilla’, as she is known to friends, in a rare interview.History relates that they struck up a conversation while queuing for the loo: he charmed her with computer science-based ‘college humour’, apparently.After graduating from medical school, Priscilla, the daughter of Chinese ‘boat people’ from Vietnam, whose family fled communism during the Cold War, moved to Palo Alto and began working at San Francisco General Hospital.The couple moved in together in 2010, announcing this and every other formative step in their relationship via Facebook. ‘Now we have 2x everything, so if you need any household appliances, dishes, glasses, etc, please come by and take them before we give them away,’ they declared.The wedding was in 2012, days after the launch of Facebook on the stock market minted their status as billionaires, and they honeymooned in Rome, where they were photographed in that well-known Italian destination restaurant, McDonald’s.Though fully qualified as a paediatrician, Priscilla no longer has an employer to list on social media: like many a billionaire’s spouse, she devotes herself to philanthropy, running a personal charity dedicated to ‘advancing human potential and promoting equal opportunity’.Wacky home lifeThe business model of Facebook (not to mention the source of many of its recent troubles) rests on the belief that a person’s character is laid bare by the sort of thing they profess to ‘like’ on social media.On this front, Mark Zuckerberg has declared himself a fan of the sport of fencing, the pop acts Green Day, Taylor Swift, Shakira, and Jay-Z, the movie Gladiator and the fruity and violent TV series Game Of Thrones.He and Priscilla also try to find time in their busy schedules to cook family meals and bake bread, cakes and biscuits, and tend to celebrate special occasions by heading out to parties wearing wacky fancy dress outfits. Recent times have seen the family dress as Jedi knights, medieval warriors, and characters from the children’s book Where The Wild Things Are.    Face of a family: Mark Zuckerberg shown with his wife Priscilla and parents Edward and KarenWhat a psychologist might make of this is anyone’s guess, though his appearance in front of the U.S. Congress this week suggests the real Zuckerberg is nowhere near as free-wheeling and zany as his carefully curated Facebook page suggests.In fact, he’s a man with such apparent incapacity for introspection that many have suggested he may be autistic and even close friends admit that he often looks and sounds like a robot.In 2010, one told The New Yorker: ‘He’s been over-programmed.’Instead of spontaneously pursuing hobbies, Zuckerberg likes to give himself annual ‘challenges’, which he announces to his 107 m Facebook followers. They have included learning to speak Mandarin (‘some members of Priscilla’s family only speak Chinese and I want to be able to talk to them’) and, in 2011, to ‘only eat meat if I killed the animal myself’.Zuckerberg was once thought to be an atheist, but now likes to share photographs of his family celebrating Jewish festivals, stating in one caption: ‘I was raised Jewish and then I went through a period when I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.’ Priscilla, for her part, practises Buddhism.The doting dadLike millions of his users, Zuckerberg is an aficionado of ‘sharenting’ — the modern-day practice of using social media to bombard friends and acquaintances with sometimes intimate items of family news.In 2015, he told the world that Priscilla was pregnant for the first time in a heartfelt post revealing that she’d previously suffered three miscarriages, pledging to take two months’ paternity leave after becoming a father.          Zuckerberg is an aficionado of ‘sharenting’ — the modern-day practice of using social media to bombard friends and acquaintances with sometimes intimate items of family newsTheir daughter, Maxima, arrived later that year. Revealing the happy news, he used Facebook to announce that he intended to give away 99 per cent of his shares in the company during his lifetime, in an effort to make the world that she grows up in a ‘better place’.When a second girl, August, came along last summer, Zuckerberg uploaded a similarly preachy message, welcoming his newborn to the world via an open letter that urged her to make the most of childhood by finding as much time as possible to ‘go outside and play’.Somewhat awkwardly, Facebook made headlines just three months later by announcing it was launching Messenger Kids, a program designed to encourage his customers’ children to devote even more of their waking hours to staring at a screen.The fifth member of the Zuckerberg clan is Beast, a dreadlocked Hungarian sheepdog acquired from a breeder in Oregon in 2011.Naturally, the little fellow boasts his own Facebook page, with an astonishing 2.7 million followers. It contains videos of him performing a host of party tricks: dancing to rap music, barking at the Rocky theme tunes and scampering along a treadmill in his master’s home gymnasium.Although there’s also footage of Beast travelling to a rural farm to try his hand at herding sheep, the pooch’s days are largely spent in suburban Palo Alto, where his master can often be spotted walking him to the local park.          SURROUNDED: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a joint hearing of the US Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill, April 10, 2018 in Washington, DCFrom time to time, like every member of the household, he’s also required to sacrifice his dignity to indulge Mark’s love of fancy dress. Recently, he’s been photographed in everything from Star Wars outfits to faux-medieval headgear and Jewish religious attire.That T-shirtSilicon Valley myth has it that Zuckerberg’s wardrobe is stuck in perpetual adolescence, with his supposed outfit of choice a grey T-shirt and dark hooded top teamed with grey jeans, which he once claimed to wear daily in order to limit time wasted making ‘frivolous decisions’, such as deciding what to wear.In 2012, he cemented this reputation for scruffiness by turning up in a ‘hoodie’ to pitch his multi-billion-dollar IPO share offer to Wall Street executives.Around the same time, he was said to have worn pyjamas to a meeting with financial backers.Zuckerberg’s Facebook page reveals something subtly different, however: he frequently does put on a suit and tie — provided it helps him keep up appearances.So it goes that he’s donned formal attire to meet everyone from Barack Obama to the Pope and, of course, to appear before Congress this week. He also dressed up for his wedding.At Facebook HQ, meanwhile, there’s no official dress code.          Members of the audience hold up signs and wear sunglasses that read \u0027Stop Spying\u0027 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a joint hearing of the Commerce and Judiciary Committees on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, April 10, 2018But this trendy policy only extends so far: in a 2016 memoir, former employee Antonio Garcia Martinez claimed the male-dominated tech firm’s female employees were required to ‘avoid clothing that “distracted” co-workers’, adding that women who wore ‘revealing’ dresses were ‘read the riot act’.His foul mouthHowever carefully he might curate his public Facebook page, Zuckerberg hasn’t always behaved like a cuddly family man.In the early days, his business card read ‘I’m CEO, bitch,’ and, in private messages to colleagues, several of which became public during litigation, he described the site’s users as ‘dumb f**ks’ for handing over personal information to him for free.Time would, of course, prove him right: today, his 18 per cent stake in the firm provides him access to intimate details about the private lives of its two billion users. Every message they send, photograph they share and place from where they update their profile are stored on the company’s computer systems.For handing over this valuable resource, Facebook users have been paid precisely nothing.Whether Zuckerberg appreciates the responsibilities this ought to confer on him is hard to gauge.          In the well: Zuckerberg sat alone as he was questioned by the senatorsDuring the recent crisis over the firm Cambridge Analytica harvesting data from Facebook users — which knocked $60 billion off the value of the company’s shares — he took four days to make any statement and a further 24 hours to issue something approaching an apology.Presidential ambitionsSo convinced is Zuckerberg of his own brilliance that there is mounting speculation he’s thinking of one day mounting a bid for the U.S. presidency.To this end, he recently used Facebook to announce that he’s spending the year on a so-called ‘listening tour’ of all 50 U.S. states, ostensibly to listen to Facebook users, voters and local lawmakers, hiring Charles Ommanney, a photographer for the Bush and Obama campaigns, to document the exercise.His exact political allegiances are unclear: though undoubtedly a social liberal who vigorously supports gay rights and has been highly critical of Donald Trump’s policy towards immigrants and racial minorities, Zuckerberg is also thought to be fiscally conservative and his own company’s tax affairs are a case study in rapacious capitalism.He has appeared at fundraisers with the Republican governor Chris Christie in his native New Jersey, too, though the occasion was staged to mark his decision to donate $100 million to local schools, rather than to represent a political endorsement.Although he now employs Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe and his pollster Joel Benenson, and is certainly rich enough to run for the White House, he has repeatedly — for public consumption — denied any plans to run for office.Perhaps that’s just as well — for, as this week has shown, all the money in the world hasn’t helped this awkward young billionaire avoid a political car crash.

We consider the matter closed.\u0027But a former MPs\u0027 watchdog said that if Mr Hunt did not \u0027face consequences\u0027 it could create a \u0027perception of double standards\u0027, with \u0027one rule for the political elite and another rule for the rest of the population\u0027.          Mr Hunt\u0027s breaches relate to seven flats he bought in the Ocean Village complex in Southampton (pictured) in FebruarySir Alistair Graham, a former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told the Daily Telegraph, which revealed the oversight: \u0027It is a very poor show when ministers, who you expect to take leadership in standards ... do not meet the rules they are required to meet.\u0027If there has been a failure of leadership, there should be a political price for it. Either in terms of the damage to your reputation or to action by the Prime Minister in the case of the Ministerial Code, or by the Committee on Standards.\u0027Mr Hunt\u0027s breaches relate to seven flats he bought in the Ocean Village complex in Southampton in February. The average price paid for properties in the development is £240,000 per flat, according to Zoopla.          The oversight is a criminal offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prisonThe mortgages were issued by a private bank to Mare Pond Properties Limited, a company set up by Mr Hunt and his wife Lucia Guo. Miss Guo was the only person named in the registration documents filed at Companies House when the firm was incorporated in September 2017. Mr Hunt appears to have breached the Companies Act on two counts. He should have declared to Companies House he was a \u0027person with significant control\u0027 within 28 days of registration. But he did not do so for six months.Legislation passed by the Tories in 2016 made this compulsory for anyone who has more than 25 per cent of shares or voting rights in a company. The law was a central part of the Government\u0027s plan to tackle money laundering, and failure to comply is an offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prison.The second breach relates to the fact Mr Hunt\u0027s name was omitted from the registration document – a criminal offence under another section of the Companies Act. Parliamentary rules state MPs must register any shareholding greater than 15 per cent in any company within 28 days. But Mr Hunt took nearly five months to do so, registering his co-ownership of the company alongside the purchase of the flats in the Register of MPs\u0027 Interests on March 7.He told the Telegraph the breaches were down to an honest mistake by his accountant and that he had corrected the listing after being alerted to it by a member of the public on March 28.           Mr Hunt has not breached the Ministerial Code of Conduct with the Ocean Village breach, according to Cabinet Office rules, and so retains the backing of Theresa MayHis spokesman said: \u0027These were honest administrative mistakes which have already been rectified. \u0027Jeremy\u0027s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing which was a genuine oversight.\u0027The Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code. Jeremy declared the interest to them after the company was set up. \u0027They advised that as it was a shell company with no assets or value, it should only be registered when it became operational. \u0027As such, Jeremy presumed the same rules applied to Parliamentary declarations ... Jeremy accepts these mistakes are his responsibility and has apologised to the parliamentary authorities.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/19/4B175D4700000578-0-image-m-24_1523557216281.jpg","title":"Labours Emily Thornberry calls Theresa apologise Commonwealth Britains wrongs","story":"    Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said that Theresa May should seize the opportunity when she meets heads of Commonwealth governments in London next weekThe Prime Minister should apologise to the Commonwealth for Britain\u0027s \u0027historic wrongs\u0027, Emily Thornberry claimed last night.The shadow foreign secretary said that Theresa May should seize the opportunity when she meets heads of Commonwealth governments in London next week.Writing for The House magazine, Mrs Thornberry made reference to David Cameron\u0027s apology to Nelson Mandela, when he met the South African president in 2006 for the Conservative government\u0027s failure to impose sanctions on the country during apartheid, but claimed \u0027that did not go far enough\u0027.She also re-stated claims made last year by 33 Commonwealth states that Britain should be referred to the International Court of Justice over \u0027historic wrongs\u0027 committed towards Chagos islanders.Families living on the islands, referred to by Britain as part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, were forced to leave in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for a US airbase on Diego Garcia.The fate of the archipelago has been a key issue for Jeremy Corbyn in the past, The Times reported. Mauritius accused Britain of breaking international law by splitting the Chagos islands from its territory before it gained independence.Meghan is set to attend key Commonwealth Youth Forum event...Share this articleThe claims were denied by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.Mrs May should apologise \u0027not just for the wrong done to the Chagos islanders, but for the actions of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s\u0027, Mrs Thornberry said.\u0027I believe Theresa May and the Conservative government in Britain also owes an apology to the Commonwealth as a whole – and indeed Her Majesty the Queen – for ignoring the efforts of every other member thirty years ago to bring apartheid to an end.\u0027This week would be an appropriate moment to correct that historic mistake, and would send a wider signal to our Commonwealth cousins.\u0027           \u0027I believe Theresa May (pictured) and the Conservative government in Britain also owes an apology to the Commonwealth as a whole – and indeed Her Majesty the Queen – for ignoring the efforts of every other member thirty years ago to bring apartheid to an end,\u0027 said Miss Thornberry"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/04/4B19998A00000578-0-image-a-26_1523591770915.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle Chicago airport incognito finalize UK visa","story":"    Meghan Markle landed in Chicago\u0027s O\u0027Hare International Airport on Thursday morning to finalize her UK visa application          She was spotted walking through the airport in a White Sox baseball cap in an attempt to remain incognitoOne source said that Chicago police provided security for Meghan but did not give her an actual escort as she went through the airport. According to TMZ, Meghan entered the VFS Global UK Visa Application Centre in Chicago Thursday to finalize her application after she landed in the city. Meghan is set to attend key Commonwealth Youth Forum event...Meghan Markle is blasted by her sister for \u0027inviting...Share this articleThe entire process took about 10 minutes where staff cleared the office for her while she filled out the paperwork. Meghan reportedly paid an estimated $1,500 or more to have the visa expedited so she can receive in the next couple of days. This comes just one month before she is due at the alter to marry Prince Harry. They are scheduled to be wed at Windsor Castle on May 19 and more than 2,500 people have been invited to attend the event. The future wife to Prince Harry appears to be crossing some to-do items off her list before the ceremony.             Meghan reportedly had the Chicago visa office cleared out so she could finalize her visa.

In 1955, the Catholic Church dedicated the day to Saint Joseph the Worker and during the Cold War, May Day was marked with large military parades in the Red Square of the Soviet Union.When is Labour Day 2018?In the UK, after being introduced by Michael Foot, the then-Employment Secretary in 1978, Labour Day is celebrated on May Day and is marked as a spring bank holiday.As the bank holiday is always held on the first Monday in May and May Day falls on a Tuesday in 2018, the day will be marked on Monday, May 7, 2018.Although there are many traditional May Day rites that have existed for hundreds of years, May Day was not linked to International Workers’ Day until the 20th century and is not known officially as Labour Day in the UK.Where are the 2018 International Workers’ Day protests?Since the 2000s, anti-capitalist movements have held a number of protests across the UK that have resulted in clashes with the police.

The ex-hospital doctor, who has not practised since 2012, was found to have behaved in a sexually motivated way.

They now have two young children.The relationship between father and daughter has now fractured so badly they are facing each other across a courtroom, arguing over ownership of a flat in London, a house in Surrey, cash from four properties in the USA and 23 items of jewellery which belonged to Mrs Wamsteker’s dead mother, said to be worth about £1million in total.Judge Simon Monty QC, at Central London County Court, heard that Mrs Wamsteker, who lives in Canary Wharf, East London, has been practicing law in London for 17 years and previously worked for accounting giants Ernst and Young.Her father, who lives in Stratford, East London, told the court that he is also a qualified lawyer.The pair had always been close in their personal and financial lives, sharing a mutually \u0027loving and generous\u0027 relationship as the family built up a portfolio of properties across London, the USA and Malaysia.But that was before rows over their respective choice of partners following the death of Mrs Wamsteker’s mother - Mr David’s first wife - in 2008, tore the family apart.When her widowed father \u0027formed an attachment to and subsequently married\u0027 her Filipino nanny, Mrs Wamsteker \u0027objected strongly to the relationship, describing it as ‘unthinkably repugnant’, the judge was told.Britney Spears and Will.i.am lose legal battle against...Tiger Woods embroiled in legal battle with his ex-girlfriend...Share this articleThe pensioner accepted that he \u0027doesn’t like\u0027 his daughter’s husband, 52-year-old investment director Adrianus Wamsteker, but denied accusations that he had previously threatened him with an axe.The father and daughter’s dislike of each other’s partners, and particularly Mr David’s marriage to her au pair, \u0027has resulted in the wholesale breakdown of the close relationship between them,\u0027 Mrs Wamsteker’s barrister, Desmond Kilcoyne, told the judge.\u0027The existing litigation is now motivated by a high degree of animosity by Mr David towards his daughter and particularly her husband,\u0027 he added.The English properties at stake in the case are a four-bedroom detached bungalow in Salisbury Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, previously marketed for £740,000, and a flat in Selsdon Road, West Ham, East London, worth about £275,000.Mr David says that he is the \u0027beneficial owner\u0027 of both properties - despite them being in his daughter’s name - having stumped up the deposits for them both and either \u0027funded\u0027 or made \u0027contributions\u0027 to their mortgages.          Audra Wamsteker, 49, and her husband Adrianus Wamsteker are pictured outside court as she battles her father for her dead mother\u0027s jewellery and international property portfolio As well as a declaration that he owns the properties, Mr David wants his daughter to pay him around £150,000 in rent for having \u0027excluded\u0027 him from the house and the flat since 2013.He also claims he paid for four properties in Florida which were sold in 2014 and is now \u0027entitled to the proceeds of sale\u0027, which Mrs Wamsteker currently holds.Finally Mr David is demanding his daughter return to him 23 items of his late first wife’s jewellery.Mr Kilcoyne, for Mrs Wamsteker, told the judge that she denies her father has ever owned any of the properties.She also refuses to give up her late mother’s jewellery as she says it was \u0027a gift\u0027 by her father before their relationship broke down.Mr David, who is representing himself and is backed by his son Alvin - also a qualifed lawyer - told the judge from the witness box that the jewellery, along with a box of her deceased mother’s clothes, \u0027were not given to her, but taken to her house for safekeeping\u0027.Mr Kilcoyne pointed to emails he said proved the gift had been made, in one of which Mr David told his daughter: \u0027It’s no use keeping something you’ve been given by someone you hate so bitterly.\u0027But Mr David told the judge he gave Mrs Wamsteker only one item - \u0027a gold chain with pearls on it\u0027 - plus another item to her daughter, and she had wrongfully kept the rest.Mr Kilcoyne told Mr David: \u0027There have been a number of arrangements between you and your daughter, at the end of which arrangements she owns property. You gave that jewellery to her and now you want it back.\u0027\u0027Nothing has been given away,\u0027 he responded.Telling the judge about the close relationship he used to enjoy with his daughter, Mr David said: \u0027She told me, mummy made me swear that I’d look after you to your dying day.’Mr Kilcoyne agreed there used to be a \u0027very close bond\u0027 between them, adding: \u0027You said your daughter thinks of you like a god.\u0027But there had been a darker side to their relationship, the barrister claimed.\u0027There’s an aspect of the relationship where she has felt unable to say no to you...she says you used to badger her for money...you felt entitled to ask her for money. You demanded money, you badgered her for money,\u0027 he put to Mr David.The pensioner denied the allegations saying: \u0027She makes me look like some sort of gangster...I look like a horrible man standing here.\u0027I still love both my children,\u0027 he told the judge.Mr Kilcoyne also alleged that Mr David had threatened his daughter’s husband with an axe. \u0027You told her you would destroy her and kill her husband,\u0027 he said. Mr David replied: \u0027No. The axe was in my bedroom drawer. If I had approached him with an axe like she says, I would have hurt him. That’s true I dislike him. I don’t deny it, I don’t like him.\u0027I realised what he was when he married my daughter in 2004. She’s got a very greedy husband,\u0027 he told the judge.Alvin David, Mrs Wamsteker’s brother and Mr David’s son, who lives in New Maldon with his family, outside court valued the property, jewellery and money claims being brought by his father against his sister at around £1m. The hearing continues. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/13/4B1BD5F100000578-0-image-a-43_1523621275891.jpg","title":"Earliest portrait photos taken bring Americans 1840s life colorized","story":"A striking portrait of a young woman.

It makes sense: more than four in five Australians live within easy walking or driving distance of the sea. As writer Anna Funder recently said of those who call the driest continent on Earth home: “We cling to the edge of the continent, and we swim from a very early age.”Growing up, I hated swimming – which was awful, because I didn’t just grow up in Australia, I grew up in Queensland: the sun-saturated state that gifted us Olympic gods like Kieran Perkins, Susie O’Neill, Grant Hackett and Stephanie Rice, a state where the main trade seemed to be sugar, coal and championship swimmers.You weren’t just expected to know how to swim you were expected to be good at it, too.My parents were Cantonese migrants from Hong Kong who, in the 1970s, moved to Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, home to some of the country’s most beautiful beaches. It still strikes me as a slightly baffling decision, given neither of them could swim. Water compelled and terrified them and their five Australian-born kids.While other people saw stunning coastlines, we just saw a picturesque way to die. Rips could kill you, people said. Sharks could kill you. Skin cancer could kill you. Weirdly, it was always white people who told us these things, the same white people who seemed to keep going to the beach. Were we missing something? Did they want to die?A safer option was the public pool. Years of TV safety campaigns had convinced Mum we needed to know how to swim, because she sure as hell couldn’t save us if we were drowning. Throughout summer, we’d wail as Mum drove us to the nearest suburban leisure centre for lessons. I suspect we dreaded those lessons as much as our instructors dreaded teaching us, those hopeless Asian kids spluttering with anxiety inside the enclosed training pool, those stinking hothouses of chemicals, piss and wet togs (or cossies, or bathers, or swimmers – depending on your state).After the nightmare was over, we’d be sedated with a treat – a Redskin (Australians veer towards racism even with our confectionary), an ice block or a packet of frogs – before falling asleep in the stuffy Ford Cortina, hair matted to our temples, seat belts twisted into our skin and fingers dusted orange from the Twisties we stole from each other.The horror didn’t end there. At school, not only were swimming lessons mandatory, carnivals were too – annual, school-run swim meets, ostensibly fun but deeply competitive. We even had togs in school colours that we had to buy from the uniform shop.During the lessons, I’d watch fit white kids e in and carve through water with graceful limbs that seemed custom-built for the job. Meanwhile, in Lane 1 or 6 – where I could still hold onto the wall – I’d windmill uselessly, my hands banging into the water like saucepans. There was a direct, inverse correlation between the amount of splashing I made and the distance I travelled. At swimming carnivals, all the outcasts were bunched together: the ethnic kid with no body fat (me) pale kids with lots of body fat. We had to swim in an event – any event – so we’d do the novelty race, paddling together on inflatable rafts, damp with chlorine and shame, as everyone cheered and jeered us on. But then, weirdly, I fell in love with swimming. I left home for university, moved to Brisbane and into a rambling architectural mess of a shared house. Its design was … incorrect. It attracted the heat in summer, then trapped it. During heatwaves, my flatmates and I would emerge from our rooms having barely slept and looking boiled. I took refuge from the heat at the Olympic-sized council pool at the bottom of our hill. It didn’t look like much from the outside, but inside it was pure and clean, with a panoramic view of the city skyline. I didn’t have proper togs so I swam in black boxer briefs, hoping no one would notice. After a while, I tried swimming laps.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.Alan, the pool manager, took pity on me. “Instead of bashing into the water with your arms like that,” he said, “stretch out like this and twist your entire torso. Instead of exhaling like that, hum and you won’t lose your breath so quickly.” It was homework, and I’d always liked homework. Slowly, I got faster.By the time I moved to Sydney, I owned proper Speedos, goggles and a kickboard. I signed myself up for a 1km charity ocean swim. From some angles it seemed as though I had pecs. Who was this person?I’ve been helped by the fact Sydney has – hands down – the best lap pools in the world. Every inner-city public pool is a wonder in some way. My local, the Prince Alfred Park Pool, is an award-winning architectural miracle built into a hill – like a swimming oasis for hobbits. It’s impossible to take a bad photo of North Sydney Olympic Pool, where the reward for finishing laps is endless Instagram-ready photos of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which towers above the pool like a CGI hallucination. On the other side of the harbour, Andrew “Boy” Charlton Pool is plonked right in the middle of the botanical gardens, decked out like a resort and boasting so many toned men in Speedos, it feels like you’re in the video for Kylie Minogue’s Slow.Even Sydney’s indoor pools – which I usually avoid because of the claustrophobic chlorine pong – are impressive. Ultimo’s dreamy, wave-walled Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (the first Sydney pool I ever swam in) is a Harry Seidler original, a modernist wave of concrete and steel rising from Darling Harbour. In the Cook + Phillip Park Aquatic and Fitness Centre are giant paintings by the Archibald winner Wendy Sharpe, making it one of the few places where you can do laps in an art gallery.For a spiritual experience, it’s all about the ocean baths. On good days, you can swim alongside schools of fish in Wylie’s Baths in Coogee. There’s a reason people rave about Bondi Icebergs, with its sauna overlooking the violent churn of the surf below. And though I’ll never get to visit, I love the idea of Coogee’s McIver’s Ladies Baths, the last remaining women’s-only seawater pool in Australia. Apparently it’s particularly popular with nuns, Muslim women and lesbians I like thinking about the unexpected friendships that have been made there.Is it too far to say swimming is the Australian version of baptism? To me, these places feel sacred to swim in them veers towards sacrament. When I get writer’s block, I swim. When I need space, I swim. When I need company, I swim. When I’m depressed, I swim. When I’m happy, I swim.Last Christmas, my siblings and I – all comically terrible swimmers as kids – laughed at the fact that our eldest sister was now a regular surfer. The remaining four of us now swim regularly in lap pools. Those Asian kids at school, so bad at swimming carnivals that they were constantly disqualified?

Braithwaite, a Barbadian-born Briton who arrived here in 1961 when he was nine, was educated here, has worked here for his entire life, married here and had three British children and five British grandchildren. He had been a special needs teaching assistant at a north London primary school for over 15 years when his employers launched a “routine” immigration status check. Braithwaite, 66, assumed correctly that he was British.But now he had to prove it, providing up to four pieces of documentary evidence to the Home Office for every year he had been here. He lost his job when the Home Office failed to issue him with the documents to verify that he was in the country legally. Trying to prove he was who he was, and who nobody ever seriously doubted he always had been, made him ill. “It made me feel like I was an alien. I almost fell apart with the stress,” he said.Within minutes of the article about Braithwaite going online the Home Office had emailed his lawyers to say the documents had been approved. Welcome to the United Kingdom. With the exception of Northern Ireland, our existence as an island means our physical border is, for the most part, well defined. We stop and start at the water’s edge. The entry points, be they at ports or airports, are heavily fortified and highly militarised.But our administrative borders are invisible and omnipresent, iding communities and generations at whim and will. These borders represent not a physical space but a political one that can be reproduced without warning in places of learning and healing. At any moment almost anyone, your boss, doctor, child’s headmaster or landlord, can become a border guard – indeed they may be legally obliged to do so – and on the basis of their judgment you may be denied livelihood, family, home and health.Incredibly, this is not a glitch in the system. It is the system. And in the words of American intellectual WEB Du Bois: “A system cannot fail those it was never meant to protect.” Braithwaite has become ensnared in deliberate government policy, set out by the prime minister, Theresa May, when she was home secretary, to create a “really hostile environment for illegal immigrants”. The aim was to make life in Britain so onerous for immigrants that those who could not produce the documents at any, random, point in their daily life, would find their life so difficult that they would, in the words of Mitt Romney, “self-deport”.The acts, implemented first in the year that Ukip won the European elections and then again in the year of the Brexit referendum, were red meat to the grievances of a base that the Tories were losing. We should not be surprised that they are adversely affecting black Britons who have every right to be here, any more than we should have been surprised when there was a rise in Islamophobic attacks following Brexit – even though precious few Muslims in Britain come from elsewhere in Europe.And so it is, 70 years after Windrush brought the symbolic arrival of postwar Caribbean migrants, Braithwaite is one of many who now struggle to justify their existence. There’s Renford McIntyre, 64, who came to Britain from Jamaica when he was 14 to join his mum, worked as a tool setter, and is now homeless and unemployed, after he was fired when he couldn’t produce papers to prove his citizenship. Or 61-year-old Paulette Wilson who used to cook for MPs in the House of Commons. She was put in Yarl’s Wood removal centre and then taken to Heathrow for deportation, before a last-minute reprieve prevented her from being sent to Jamaica, which she last visited when she was 10 and where she has no surviving relatives. Or Albert Thompson, a 63-year-old who came from Jamaica as a teenager and has lived in London for 44 years. He was evicted from his council house and has now been denied NHS treatment for his cancer unless he can stump up £54,000, all because they question his immigration status.Caribbean diplomats have once again called for the Home Office to show compassion. “This is affecting people who came and gave a lifetime of service at a time when the UK was calling for workers and migrants,” explains the Barbados high commissioner, Guy Hewitt. “They came because they were encouraged to come here to help build post-second world war Britain and build it into the multicultural place that it is now.” But if compassion is lacking, common sense would do.Even as citizenship tests aim to impart to newcomers the “values of toleration and fair play”, immigration laws have sent longstanding citizens, who have paid their taxes and raised their families here, to homeless shelters or deportation centres because they have not been able to provide paperwork issued more than 40 years ago when they were kids.For, lest we forget, this is also the 50th anniversary of Enoch Powell’s rivers of blood speech: a moment that revealed the galvanising force of populist racism. This mood bleeds effortlessly into immigration policy – the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 was passed the same year, further restricting the future right of entry for former citizens of the empire and loosening the connections about which Prince Charles waxed so lyrical. Braithwaite was one of those “charming, wide-grinning piccaninnies” to which Powell so disparagingly referred.Arriving in 1961 (in the same year as my parents and coming from the same place) when Barbados was not yet independent, Braithwaite was effectively a British subject when he arrived and his parents would have had passports to that effect. To find himself treated in this way is not just a violation of natural justice – it is an abdication of Britain’s historical responsibility. Since he arrived before 1973, he has an automatic and permanent right to remain. He has violated no law it is the law that is violating him.• Gary Younge is editor-at-large for the Guardian"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70a8f61eaf08b01eab4e335025135115b53583a7/0_245_5528_3317/master/5528.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3ce1e560ed0fe653a9efbb785a20d2ce 1240w","title":"rugby misogynists public support","story":"How do legends have sex, and who\u0026nbspdo\u0026nbspthey have it with? Perhaps\u0026nbspit’s none of my business, except when these things become public knowledge, it’s because they\u0026nbspare exposed in court.That\u0026nbspword\u0026nbsp“legends” sticks in my\u0026nbspmind. Or rather in my craw. It was in one of the WhatsApp messages read out in court in the Belfast trial of the “star rugby players”, Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding, accused of rape and\u0026nbspunanimously found not guilty last month.The messages discussing what had happened the night before, for which they later apologised, talked\u0026nbspof “shaggers”, of “Belfast sluts”, of “pumping a bird” and “spit-roasting”. Such technical terms had to be\u0026nbspexplained by barristers to the judge and jury, but somehow it was the self-glorifying “Why are we are such legends?” in the players’ WhatsApp group that got me. Legends indeed.I am not sure this is the word they would be using now. This was a high-profile trial in which the woman who had\u0026nbspaccused them of rape had her bloodied knickers\u0026nbsppassed around a courtroom, in which the taxi driver who took her home told of her sobbing, and her distressed texts were also read out. Since the men’s acquittal further details have been released, of a\u0026nbsppornographic video shared with Olding the day after\u0026nbspthe night in question.The jury unanimously acquitted these men of rape.\u0026nbspTheir friends Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison were\u0026nbspunanimously found not guilty of indecent exposure\u0026nbspand of perverting the course of justice. None\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspthese men did anything illegal. Yet they are now\u0026nbspfighting in a different court: the court of public opinion. The widespread disgust at the way that they spoke about\u0026nbspthe woman who they had sex with clings to\u0026nbspthem. It is the nature of what these young men said to\u0026nbspeach other that has appalled so many people and led to\u0026nbspthe creation of the hashtag #IBelieveHer.One wonders about the kind of sex these premier\u0026nbspathletes actually want. This week Otto Putland, a swimmer who\u0026nbsprepresented Wales at the Commonwealth Games,\u0026nbspwas also cleared of rape at Cardiff crown court. He had denied forcing himself on\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspwoman after\u0026nbspshe had\u0026nbspconsensual sex with his friend, the Olympic swimmer Ieuan Lloyd.Does male bonding have to involve the seeming humiliation of women, as it does in some American college fraternities? Is it always a kind of performance that needs to be watched by their mates? In the Belfast trial\u0026nbspwhere a slang expert was brought in to explain “spit–roasting”, the woman spoke of one player penetrating her from behind while another player walked in naked, holding his penis, looking to join in.Footballer Ched Evans, unanimously cleared of rape\u0026nbspin 2016, had sex with a woman in a hotel room following a night out in Rhyl, immediately after his friend Clayton McDonald had had sex with her. Evans\u0026nbspleft via a fire exit without speaking to the woman.\u0026nbspHis younger brother and another man watched\u0026nbspthe encounter through a window.So is this is the ultimate in hyper-masculine male bonding? What is happening when these young sportsmen who know each other’s bodies, whose business is their bodies, choose to enact their\u0026nbspsexual desires in this way?Of course, there is no reason why\u0026nbspsuch\u0026nbspsexual activity should not be consensual, and a lot of pornography indicates that such\u0026nbspencounters are every woman’s\u0026nbspfantasy. Perhaps, though, in such scenarios, the women is the vessel through which these young guys communicate their\u0026nbsppower to each other?These men are not rapists, but they are guilty of\u0026nbsp vile misogyny. None of them presumably has difficulty getting women, who flock to them. To bring\u0026nbspJackson and Olding back on to the rugby field now,\u0026nbspas their supporters are demanding, would appear\u0026nbspto endorse what looks like degrading behaviour. This would hardly be the first time such a thing has happened. But\u0026nbsphow do we teach the boys who admire and emulate sportsmen to respect women if this is how\u0026nbsptheir role models conduct themselves? Talking after his acquittal about the risks of mixing alcohol and sex, Ched Evans said he had been “young” and “stupid” at the time.Is behaviour such as Jackson’s and Olding’s – which some seem willing to write off as high jinks, high-testosterone pranks – in fact best understood as being meant for each other? These men may need an audience for their performances and then to congratulate each other the next day. But is this really living the dream?For that dream, as we have seen, can turn into a nightmare for everyone involved, while a woman can look from the outside as if she is a disposable conduit, not a person in her own right. This is where we still are. And yet there are voices telling us to think about these poor innocent lads whose reputations are ruined. It is shameful.Misogyny is not a crime, clearly, but spare me the suffering of these rugby legends. For them to be portrayed as victims, now? That is truly unbelievable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67569b0771060a3b13f5ffb27a58fa10aef41bf7/92_0_3274_1965/master/3274.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b103f1524c02a8701533fadb160f47a5 1240w","title":"mps to pressure government on backing for swansea tidal lagoon project","story":"Committees seek clarity on indecision over taxpayer support and price guarantees for flagship tidal clean energy scheme to harness tide powerMPs are to press ministers on why they have left investors hanging in limbo over taxpayer support for a pioneering £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea.The business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee and Welsh affairs committee will call on government to explain why no decision has been forthcoming on the flagship scheme. The government has still not indicated whether it is minded to support the lagoon, 15 months since an independent review told ministers to back the clean energy project.Tidal Lagoon Power, a Gloucester-based company, has been pushing for years to build the first of five lagoons at Swansea, to harness power from the ebb and flow of the tides.But the company needs an indication the government is prepared to negotiate a guaranteed price of power for the renewable energy it produces, akin to the ones awarded to windfarm and nuclear power station developers.The BEIS and Welsh affairs committees will now hold an evidence session on the government’s decision-making process, most likely in May, the Guardian understands.The energy minister, Claire Perry, would be the obvious government representative to be quizzed by the MPs on the indecision, which Tidal Lagoon Power recently warned could lead it to significantly reduce its workforce.Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the BEIS committee, has previously urged minister to give investors clarity on the lagoon. “If they don’t think it can make a contribution, then they should be honest about that and explain what other measures they will take to reduce our carbon emissions,” she has said.Greg Clark, business secretary, told parliament in March that he did not “want to close the door” on the project yet.But he also said that the proposal had initially required a subsidy price twice as expensive as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Privately, in letters to the Welsh government, which has offered to help on financing the lagoon, Clark said the technology was untried, with high capital costs and significant uncertainties. The Welsh government said talks with Whitehall had been constructive but “need to get into far more detail” to reach a swift conclusion.A spokesperson for BEIS said: “Any decision on the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project will have to represent value for money for the UK taxpayer as well as the consumer.”Tidal Lagoon Power declined to comment.While the Swansea lagoon is currently stalled, another UK tidal power project took an important step forward this week.Scotland-based Atlantis announced the first of its tidal power array in the Pentland Firth, a strait in northern Scotland, had entered the start of its 25-year operations phase. The MeyGen scheme is the world’s largest tidal stream array but at 6MW of capacity is much smaller than the planned 320MW Swansea lagoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc5737084aebc6349dee3cf65659b5b9717c15c8/0_0_4000_2693/master/4000.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=825717a04d9753dd3cde4f6c74913154 1320w","title":"what wore this week cardigan jess cartner morle","story":"It is neat enough to look smart, without being sheepish it is bold enough to be a fashion statement without looking madIt is ridiculous for me to even think of buying any more cardigans. I have loads already. There are cardigans hiding under coats on the hooks in the hallway. There is a drawer stuffed full of cardigans squished up like cotton wool balls, from which when opened a heady scent drifts out of anti-moth lavender oil mixed with the woodiness that permeates knitwear worn to watch an entire box set in the cosiest spot on the sofa right next to the fire. There is a cardigan that took up residency on the back of the bathroom door years ago and somehow never budged.But all of those cardigans are wrong. They fall into two camps of equal and opposing wrongness. Half of them are crew-neck, fine-knit, waist-length cardigans, which I have in endless colours. They have no shape on the hanger, being essentially designed for shapeless arm-and-shoulder coverage over a dress or vest or T-shirt. They are undeniably useful when you are a bit chilly but don’t want to wear a coat. But there is something irritatingly apologetic about them. They are cardigans for a boring woman who puts a boring cardigan on over her boring dress to ward off goosebumps at a boring party. Who wants to be her? Let’s be Rihanna, who if she got chilly at a\u0026nbspparty would shoulder-robe a massive shiny padded jacket instead.So that’s one half of my cardigans. The other half are oversized, woolly mammoths. These are actually quite fashionable, in a Prada-catwalk kind of a way, but unless you look as if you are on a Prada catwalk you look, instead, like an awkward sixth former hunched into their teenage angst comfort blanket.So yeah, I need a new cardigan. In fact, I need this one. Were money no object, I would be getting my new cardigan from Gucci, the source of modern cardigan inspo, but failing that I have looked everywhere else and decided this Marks \u0026amp Spencer one is the best. It is neat enough to look smart, without being sheepish it is bold enough to be a fashion statement without looking mad.But it’s not just about getting a new cardigan, it’s about treating it properly. I don’t just mean not leaving it hanging on a chair so it gets weird indents in the shoulders. I mean wearing it with an interesting pair of trousers, like this, so that it gets to be part of an outfit. I mean putting it with a\u0026nbsphigh-neck blouse or a fine cotton polo neck rather than over a vest top. The new cardigan isn’t just a layer, it’s a look. If you have one, time to bring it out of hiding.• Jess wears cardigan, £35, and heels, £49.50, both marksandspencer.com. Top, £85, kitristudio.com.

We look at 10 of the worst with fresh eyesEveryone has blind spots when it comes to things they loved as a child: you don’t remember how shonky your favourite toys were, or how weirdly racist your most-adored first books could be. Partly, this is because you encountered these things as a child and so didn’t think to question them, but it’s also because you don’t want to question them, because questioning them means rewriting your happiest memories.This is probably why John Hughes has got a free pass for so long. Many of us who are now adults grew up with his films and cherished them with the fond sentimentality French novelists reserve for madeleines. He is – rightly – held up as the man who brought a soulfulness to the teen genre, but that was never Hughes’s full story, really. So when Molly Ringwald, who starred in three of his teen movies, wrote in the New Yorker this week about rewatching those films in the #MeToo era and pointed out that, actually, Hughes’s teen films have some distinctly unsoulful elements to them, it was, for fans, as if the emperor’s most devoted courtier had pointed out his (semi) nudity. Ringwald cites 16 Candles in particular, although with its rapiness and racism, that movie has been pretty unwatchable for a while now, surviving only on nostalgia. But she also talks about The Breakfast Club, a film still genuinely so beloved that a restaurant chain is named after it. Yet the school thug (Judd Nelson) is vicious to Ringwald’s character throughout the film, even looking up her skirt in one scene and poking her in the vagina, and still she swoons into his arms at the end.I have never loved The Breakfast Club, mainly because it is so weird about the two female teen characters: one gets together with her bully and the other (Ally Sheedy) has to have a makeover to be deemed socially acceptable. Hughes adored and respected Ringwald, but this only comes across in their last – and, uncoincidentally, best – film, Pretty in Pink.Films from the 80s have lasted amazingly well, considering some are now almost 40 years old. But there is no doubt social attitudes have changed, particularly post #MeToo. Some clunkingly dated examples are obvious: everyone knows that Fatal Attraction is completely ridiculous about single women, and nobody watches 9½ Weeks for a healthy depiction of sexual politics. But it’s the creepy jokes and weird dynamics that can really make the heart sink.Yet, as Ringwald rightly says, pointing out the flaws does not mean you have to disown it. It is part of being a grownup, as much as suddenly seeing your parents’ fallibilities and still loving them. You love things from the past with the heart of a child, but you can simultaneously see them through the eyes of an adult.The ultimate example of a story idea that should have been made as a horror film but was somehow instead written up as a romantic comedy. A handyman (Kurt Russell) lies to a woman with amnesia (Goldie Hawn) and tells her she is his wife just so she will clean his house, look after his kids and, ultimately, have sex with him. “Does she run in the opposite direction when she finds out the truth?” SPOILER! She does not. Russell and Hawn famously have one of the stablest relationships in Hollywood, so you have to wonder how they looked at this script and thought, “Yup, that seems normal – sign us up!”Yes, Tess (Melanie Griffith) is celebrated for being ambitious. Look, she swaps her trainers for heels under her desk! But she is also depicted as a kind of babyish sex doll, one who girlishly defers to her men (Alec Baldwin and then Harrison Ford) and talks in the voice of a child. She can only progress up the ladder not by fighting sexism, but by tearing down another woman, the pointedly very adult Katharine (Sigourney Weaver), who is mocked for worrying about her fertility, physically humiliated and finally banished. Working Girl was certainly not the only 80s film to be conflicted about feminism and full of contradictory messages to women, but the fact it is still celebrated as a feminist classic makes its weirdness all the weirder.I love Ghostbusters, you love Ghostbusters, we all love Ghostbusters. But let’s be honest, Venkman (Bill Murray) is a total creep. In his opening scene he is literally giving electric shocks to one of his male students just so he can try to sleep with a female student, and then he later barges into Dana’s (Sigourney Weaver) apartment when she specifically didn’t want him to come over. Look, I didn’t want to accept this either, and for a while I convinced myself that Venkman proves himself to be a good guy when he resists having sex with Dana even though she is possessed by the demon of a horny dog and begs him to do so. But if your bar for male goodness is not taking advantage of a woman who is actually a dog, your bar is probably too low.There are some 80s films that haven’t lasted but really should have done: Crossing Delancey and Lucas, for example, are stone-cold classics that no one watches now when they absolutely should, ideally every day. And then there are films that have had a longevity that baffles even the most devoted 80s fans. Mannequin is one such film. Yes, Andrew McCarthy’s smile is so magical it should be a Unesco-protected tourist site, and yes, the film does get bonus points for the presence of Estelle Getty, AKA Dorothea from The Golden Girls. But that does not change the fact this is a romantic comedy about a man who falls in love with a plastic doll. The perfect woman, it turns out, is one who only comes to life when given permission to do so. At least 2007’s Lars and the Real Girl, starring Ryan Gosling, admits the weirdness of this man-and-doll set-up. Mannequin, however, plays it purely for romance, and not even the always-welcome presence of Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now by Starship on the soundtrack changes the wrongness of this film.Arguably the greatest teen film of all time and definitely the greatest John Cusack film ever (don’t even try, High Fidelity and Grosse Pointe Blank fans). I love this film so much I used a quote from it to open one of my books (“The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don’t be a guy”.) And yet I also accept it can also be seen as exemplifying the long-established truth that films romanticise harassment and stalking. The film opens with Lloyd (Cusack) claiming he once went on a date with Diane (Ione Skye) because he sat near her while eating in the mall, which sounds, let’s be frank, kinda stalkery. Later, Lloyd, freshly dumped, stands outside Diane’s window and plays the song (In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel) to which he and she once had sex. This may well be the most awweww moment ever committed to celluloid, and it only falls on the aww side of the former thanks to Cusack’s Cusackiness.The 80s were so full of bodyswap films they became a genre unto themselves: 18 Again!, Vice-Versa, Like Father Like Son, All of Me, Dream a Little Dream, and I am not ashamed to say I have seen them all, yes, even the one in which Judge Reinhold swaps bodies with Fred Savage. Twice. No, YOU had a wasted youth. Big is so superior to all those other bodyswap films it’s pretty much in a different universe, which is why you have seen it 17 times and had never before heard of Vice-Versa. But in one respect it falls victim to the genre’s cliche in having the child-in-the-body-of-a-man have sex with a grown woman who has no idea who she is actually sleeping with. And sure, Tom Hanks carries off the scene with sweet panache, staring dazedly at his girlfriend Susan’s (Elizabeth Perkins) bra, but it is still a 13-year-old having sex with a thirtysomething. Things reach peak weirdness when Susan drops him back off at his mother’s and watches him turn back into a little boy. She smiles lovingly at his 13-year-old face, remarkably unbothered that she should now be arrested for paedophilia. Heartwarming!This may well be the greatest Christmas film of all time, but it is also part of a different genre we can call the 80s Anti-Feminism Movie. It’s a pretty packed genre: there was Mr Mom (by, yes, John Hughes), which warned that women going out to work would destroy the nuclear family, and let’s not even get started, please, on Fatal Attraction. Die Hard is subtler than both of those films, but it definitely fits in. John McClane (Bruce Willis) has come to LA from New York because his wife, Holly, dared to want to take a big job there, even though, as McClane stresses early on, this destroyed their marriage. He is disgusted when he arrives at her office to hear everyone call her by her maiden name, and her office is full of coked-up sleazeballs and terrorists, emphasising how wrong Holly’s choice was. But don’t worry, by the end of the film she is tamed and she insists, to her husband’s delight, to be addressed as “Mrs McClane”. That’s right, Bruce. You keep the little woman in line.Strictly speaking, this is a 70s film, as it came out in 1979, but given I saw it in the 80s I’m including it. And when I saw it, when I was eight, I thought this was the funniest film anyone could ever and would ever make. Directed by Ivan Reitman, co-written by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray in his first starring film role, Meatballs, about a rather unorthodox summer camp, can be seen as the early comedy prototype for Ghostbusters, given how many crucial cast and crew members of the two films overlapped. And, like Ghostbusters, it has definite weirdness in it that you can overlook as a kid but will wince at as an adult. Murray plays Tripper, a very Murray-ish camp counsellor, who torments the kids, flirts with the women and is goofily aggressive to the woman he actually likes, Roxanne (Kate Lynch), a fellow counsellor. In one scene, he makes a move on Roxanne and by “makes a move” I mean chases her around his office while she tries to fight him off, pushes her to the ground and the whole scene is, to use the technical term, totally rapey. In short, the lesson of Murray’s early comedies is, a man could get away with a lot of gross behaviour on screen, if he was Bill MurrayThese days nerds are seen as charming, rumpled, cool and even a bit sexy. Back in the 80s, they were generally depicted as voyeuristic sex pests, peering into the girls’ changing room through their taped-up glasses, and no film exemplified this more than Revenge of the Nerds.

Danielle, who was raped in 1997, holds her baby while recounting the rape she has put in the background for nearly 20 years, explaining to an investigator that her attacker told her: “If you don’t shut up, I’ll beat your ass.” When the investigator brings out a photograph lineup of potential suspects, she picks the attacker out instantly. Then she learns that while his DNA has been tied to two other rapes, he is not yet in police custody. The systemic apathy towards testing these kits, paired with surveillance footage of other attacks and one particularly frustrating scene of a woman being questioned in a courtroom about what she was wearing when she was attacked, underlines that this crisis developed because of how society sees women. Several people explain that had the system worked as it should, the rape of one of the women featured in the documentary, Amberley, would have been prevented. In 1998, Amberley was abducted and raped in Ohio, two years after the same rapist raped and abducted a 17-year-old in California who had immediately had a rape kit done. Michelle Brettin, the retired Ohio police officer who investigated Amberley’s case, said if every rape kit in the country were tested, she expected the DNA from Amberley’s rapist would turn up in other cases. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they found a body attached to it,” Brettin said. Despite the overwhelming nature of the problem, which sees someone in the US sexually assaulted every 98 seconds, the women interviewed cut an inspiring image of resilience and bravery.“The film is really dedicated to the people most affected by the issue, which is the survivors,” said Adlesic. “We’re here to help change this but we really wanted their voice to be the voice of the film, and it is.”Adlesic produced the documentary with Mariska Hargitay, who played Olivia Benson on Law \u0026amp Order: Special Victims Unit, a character who advocated for survivors and had herself been sexually assaulted. Hargitay is an advocate for sexual assault victims in part because people would write to her about their abuse stories after seeing Law \u0026amp Order. “At first it was a few, then it was more, then it was hundreds, then it was thousands,” she says in the documentary.Hargitay appears briefly in the film to spotlight Detroit’s efforts to respond to the backlog.Viewers see another glimmer of hope in Ohio, where officials have acknowledged their failure to test kits and are seen working to improve the entire system, not just clear out the untested kits.“For every story, there is hope to it because it was what was organically happening on the ground,” said Gandbhir. She explained that they had interviewed 14 survivors for the film, but decided to focus on four women in the editing process, using their stories to also explain what was happening in the three states featured in the film: California, Ohio and Michigan. “We would have loved to feature every single person because every single story could have been its own movie,” said Gandbhir. The documentarians have also created an infrastructure around the film to encourage people to check on their local rape kit backlogs. Because of the momentum around clearing the backlogs, and improving how the criminal justice system responds to these crimes, hundreds of watch parties are being held across the US for the documentary premiere on 16 April. One of those parties is being held in Detroit by a key figure in the film, Ericka Murria. She said a party meant for just her family has swelled to include 700 guests. Murria reveals in the documentary that until agreeing to appear in the film, she had for 12 years kept secret that she was raped on her 21st birthday.Murria inspired the documentary’s title when she explained in an interview what it meant to have the rape kit sitting untested in an office for more than a decade. Murria said: “I am evidence, literally. My name is on a box, on a shelf that’s never been tested.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbc17fe2b322b530ff42d0aa96f3902f7c34212a/0_28_1872_1123/master/1872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dd2e99dbf39d5af2933dae7569aeb07b 1240w","title":"bayern munich niko kovac new manager","story":"Bayern Munich have confirmed that Niko Kovac will take over as the club’s new manager in July.The 46-year-old former Croatia midfielder will succeed Jupp Heynckes, who was appointed to replace Carlo Ancelotti on an interim basis in September.“Niko Kovac will be the new coach of FC Bayern from 1 July, 2018,” said sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic. “We agreed on a three-year contract yesterday. Niko was a Bayern player, he knows the people in charge as well as the structure and the club’s DNA. We are convinced he is the right coach for the future of Bayern.”The 46-year-old, who had a long playing career in the Bundesliga, was at Bayern between 2001-03. Kovac, who won 83 caps for Croatia but was born in Berlin, has been in charge of Eintracht Frankfurt since 2016.The decision in favour of Kovac marks a turn for success-driven Bayern, who had previously opted for big-name coaches including Champions League winners Heynckes, Louis van Gaal and Pep Guardiola.After retiring Kovac was briefly an assistant coach in Austria and took over Croatia before signing with relegation-threatened Eintracht in 2016 and turning them into Champions League contenders this season.His brother Robert, also a former Bayern player, will join him from Frankfurt as his assistant.Meanwhile, Bayern have also confirmed that wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery are in talks over securing extended stays in Bavaria after discussions on Thursday. “We will have news in the next days,” Salihamidzic said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7edcdd0d72e927bd29a22fc6c69452c208801ca2/0_165_5448_3268/master/5448.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8b63bcb19564114f671d067efc5f2a1b 1240w","title":"champions league draw liverpool real madrid roma bayern munich semi finals","story":"Liverpool have been drawn against Roma in the semi-finals of the Champions League.Jürgen Klopp’s side came through an all-Premier League quarter-final against Manchester City, winning the first leg 3-0 at Anfield and the second 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night.Serie A side Roma produced a remarkable comeback to knock out Barcelona. The Italian team lost the first leg 4-1 in Spain, but progressed on away goals following a 3-0 home victory.For Mohamed Salah, the Liverpool forward, it will be a return to Rome, where he scored 29 goals in 65 league appearances before moving on last summer.“Of the three options that were available I’ve never played there before so that is already exciting,” said Klopp. “It will be two difficult games. Roma are a fantastic side as you saw against Barcelona. They played a very good season after a difficult transfer window for them last summer. They lost Mo, Emerson and other key players but still they played a really good season and are fighting for the Champions League again. When we face Roma we will know everything about them. I saw the second leg against Barcelona and they were outstandingly good.”The final will take place in Kiev at the end of May but the Scotland defender, Andrew Robertson, insists Liverpool will not fear any opposition.“This club has been here before and they know how hard it is – regardless of who you are playing – to get to the final and try to win this trophy,” Robertson said. “We know how hard it’s going to be and we need to try and work so hard to get to the final because we need to deserve it.”The Roma sporting director has challenged his players to channel the same spirit that they did against Barça on Tuesday.“It feels like a great opportunity to chase the joy that we were not able to experience so many years ago,” Monchi said. “But of course it will be difficult because Liverpool are an extremely strong side. We need to think about ourselves, and try to reproduce what we were able to show against Barcelona.”The other semi-final will be between European heavyweights Bayern Munich and holders Real Madrid, who needed a dramatic stoppage-time penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo to see off Juventus after the Italian outfit had come back from 3-0 down in the first leg to level the tie. “It’s one of European football’s top clashes,” said Bayern’s departing manager, Jupp Heynckes. “It’s the defending champions against a top side with quality players.”The first legs will be played on 2425 April, with the second legs on 12 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4febc2cd3134679da674df2595e5123fa96e1744/0_13_802_481/master/802.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=acef7e983b631582ae01c43df1fe1835 1240w","title":"gambling commission sutton united piegate","story":"• Sutton goalkeeper Wayne Shaw was fined £375 after eating pie• Tabcorp UK Limited, trading as Sun Bets, offered odds of 81The betting firm behind last year’s “piegate” controversy has been fined and told it risks losing its licence for its role in a publicity stunt that led to Sutton United’s goalkeeper eating a pie during the football club’s televised FA Cup tie with Arsenal.Tabcorp, which owns the Sun Bets brand, was fined £84,000 by the Gambling Commission for offering odds of 81 that substitute goalkeeper Wayne Shaw would finish an entire pie while the game was going on.Shaw’s successful consumption of the pastry-based snack during his club’s FA Cup fifth-round tie against Arsenal in February 2017 resulted in him being fined £375 by the Football Association and banned for two months from all footballing activity. He later resigned from the club.The commission also punished Tabcorp for offering bets on whether a streaker would run on to the pitch, which it warned was potential inducement to committing a criminal offence.The commission said Tabcorp could lose its licence to operate in the UK if it is found to be behind similar stunts in future.During the course of its investigation into piegate, the regulator also found that Tabcorp allowed more than 100 gamblers who had asked to be barred from placing bets to continue doing so by opening duplicate accounts.Richard Watson, the commission’s programme director, said: “Vulnerable customers were able to gamble with Tabcorp UK, despite choosing to self-exclude. This is not acceptable. Gambling firms must ensure the systems they have in place are protecting their customers effectively.”He added: “Novelty betting markets, such as the market Tabcorp UK offered on last year’s FA Cup tie between Sutton United and Arsenal, may seem like a bit of fun but the consequences were serious – with the potential to encourage someone to commit a criminal act or breach a sports governing body’s rules.”The commission said Tabcorp had accepted that it “did not carry out a specific risk assessment on the potential impact of the pie-eating market on the inidual who had a pivotal role in determining the outcome of that market”.It said the company also realised it “should not have placed reliance on the eating of the pie being broadcast live on the BBC as being sufficient to fully manage the potential integrity risks involved”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf23bc21a9fba4d01c4c10f5cf01fd0e1c04816/0_153_4580_2748/master/4580.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fa8e7cd82147da0189fad9120aa13d7c 1240w","title":"champions league semi final draw live","story":"Liverpool have been handed a semi-final against Roma, while Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich face Real Madrid in the last fourLiverpool will need to overcome Serie A side Roma over two legs if they are to prevail to the Champions League final in Kiev at the end of May.

That’s a repeat of last season’s quarter-final.Here we go ... with Shevchenko’s wise words that “anything can happen” the last soundbite before he plunges into the hats.An email, a question for you to ponder while Andriy Shevchenko rocks up on stage in Nyon to get the draw, and party, started. “Given Arsenal were given the toughest possible draw in the semis,” says Simon. “I’d like to ask The Guardian readership, is it better to face a top side over two legs or in a one off in the final? I’d go one off in the final.” Some breaking news coming out of one our semi-finalists: Bayern Munich have announced that Niko Kovac will take over as the club’s new manager from 1 July, after agreeing a three-year contract on Thursday. So, there we go. Heynckes will depart, as originally planned, perhaps off the back of a treble and Kovac will enter. The 46-year-old, a former midfielder at Bayern, is currently in charge at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga, that being his first job in club management.The mayor of Kiev, the one and only Vitali Klitschko – that’s right – is out on the stage to give a whimsical presentation about how the Ukrainian capital has transformed into a sporting hub, for this year at least. He’s wearing glasses, and looks a changed man himself from the one we’ve seen in the ring. “Kiev is a beautiful city, especially in spring, especially beautiful in May,” he muses. “Welcome.” Superb. Here we go ... kick-off is upon us in Nyon, Switzerland. Just the formalities, pleasantries and a flurry of quarter-final montages to get through. While we wait, a reminder that the final takes place in Kiev, on Saturday 26 May at the Olimpiyskyi Stadium.This is Real Madrid’s eighth successive Champions League semi-final. Not bad, eh? They squeezed through this time, at least. As for Liverpool, the last time they reached this stage was in 2008, when they lost to Chelsea over two legs. As for Roma, they have not been this far since 1984, when, believe it or not, Dundee United were the opposition. Bayern, meanwhile, have plenty of pedigree when it comes to breezing into the last four – but not last year, when Real beat them in the quarter-finals.With six minutes to go until the get-go in Nyon, some people are just tempting fate. “It feels like I’ve played Real Madrid thousands of times in my career, so if it’s them it’s fine,” Mats Hummels, the Bayern defender muses. “That said, the other opponents would be more interesting: I’ve only played Liverpool once, and never against Roma.”Another thing that you ought to be doing in the meantime is signing up to The Fiver. If you haven’t already, you are missing out on your tea-timely football fix:While we’re waiting to get under way – we’re expecting kick-off in less than 20 minutes – soak back into your armchair, and lap up this European treat:The Liverpool defender, Andy Robertson, has had his two-pennies’ worth about who wants who. “I don’t think we have a preference,” he trilled. “This club has been here before and they know how hard it is – regardless of who you are playing – to get to the final and try to win this trophy. We know how hard it’s going to be and we need to try and work so hard to get to the final because we need to deserve it.” As for Trent Alexander-Arnold, the 19-year-old reckons him and his team-mates are fearless:The good news? Andriy Shevchenko and Wladimir Klitschko are both in the house in Nyon, with the Champions League semi-final draw almost upon us. With the Europa League draw out of the way, all eyes move to this, where Liverpool, Roma, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid all await their fate.The road to Kiev has narrowed, with just four teams remaining in the semi-finals. Liverpool, Roma, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich await their fate in Nyon, with the draw set to get under way around 12pm. We will get started shortly.

A reminder that the semis will be played on two Thursdays: 26 April (first leg) and the 3 May (second leg).Arsenal, Atlético, Marseille and Salzburg are settling down for the draw. Meanwhile, the Marseille captain these days, Dimitri Payet, has dodged a question about which team’s full-back he, if given the chance to choose, would wring inside out. “When you’re at this level, you know that the final is close. You know too that standard keeps improving. Whoever we face, we’ll have to put in twice as much effort to treat ourselves to a final.”Héctor Bellerín, Arsenal defender, has had his own say on he fancies playing. “Right now with the teams in the Europa League,” he says. “With Atlético Madrid and Milan, who we beat, these teams are Champions League teams, so for us to win this competition would mean the world.” His team-mate, Alexandre Lacazette, has gone one better he reckons lifting the trophy in Lyon would be enough to keep Wenger in the job.No wonder Arsène can’t bring himself to predicting who his side may face, instead preferring to accept his fate. “Maybe it’s better I don’t wish for anybody and just wait for the draw,” Wenger says. “Atlético are the strongest, but let’s just play well against the team we get. Let’s prepare well for the semi.”“Who do I want to get in the draw?” says Valon Berisha, the Salzburg midfielder. “Arsenal.” His manager, Marco Rose, lifted the Uefa Youth League last season with the club’s Under-18s. Can the German upgrade to securing the Europa League time around? “I think Atlético are in a class of their own,” adds Salzburg’s defender, Stefan Lainer. “They would be the toughest opponent.”Arsène Wenger’s side avoided a scare in Moscow to reach the last four of the Europa League – but who will they face? They will surely hope to dodge drawing Atlético Madrid, while Salzburg and Marseille will be regarded as underdogs, unless they draw each other, of course.

After a patient build-up, 2017 was such a breakthrough year for the bewitching London-born singer – selling over a million copies of her self-titled debut album and cruising past some of the world’s biggest pop stars to be crowned the most-streamed female artist in the UK – that she could probably take a few months off. But Lipa has continued her vertiginous career ascent in 2018, claiming two Brit awards in February, teaming up with dancefloor genie Calvin Harris for sleek new club banger One Kiss and insouciantly cracking a billion YouTube views for New Rules, her signature hit that warns against backsliding into a lousy relationship with a stern but moreish checklist-style mantra.While impressive on paper, racking up record-breaking streaming stats can sometimes feel like an intangible, almost passive form of success. But Lipa’s industrious workrate and gruelling tour schedule (including a stint supporting Coldplay) have clearly brought palpable real-world benefits. When she last played Glasgow six months ago it was in a crammed 2,500-capacity venue. Now she is packing them to the rafters in a giant arena bowl made for 13,000. Her core fanbase skews young and female but while the screams are as loud and piercing as at any Bieber show, the crowd seem keen to reflect back some of Lipa’s worldly sophistication. Compared to most full-bore pop gigs at the Hydro, there is a distinct lack of strobing deely boppers.On magazine covers and in impeccably styled promo shots, Lipa often looks aloof or simply nonplussed. But the 22-year-old kicks off by imploring fans to “be your most unapologetic you” and “dance the night away”, and promptly leads by example through Blow Your Mind (Mwah), a slice of futuristic disco that slyly incorporates an actual kiss-off into its chorus. For sustained stretches of her 90-minute show, Lipa is in perpetual motion, bouncing and reeling round the stage in billowing black joggers, springy trainers and aquamarine bra. She is flanked by four equally tireless dancers while her long-serving backing trio of a drummer and two multitasking keyboardguitarists jam away atop oversized stage cubes.A massive projection screen showing artfully stylised visuals and pulsing hyperspace starfields is arena-show standard but otherwise there is a distinct lack of large-scale staging gimmicks. It makes it all the more impressive that Lipa is able to sustain so many winningly jazzercise-style dance routines without missing a note.There are moments of delirious communion, as when Lipa hoists herself up on the front-row stage barrier to conduct a singalong to the yearning Be the One. But there are also moments of spine-tingling spotlight: the stripped-down obsessional ballad Thinking ’Bout You, with just her and guitar, showcases her voice at its smokiest. Strip away the headstrong beats and synthy stabs of her biggest hits and Lipa would remain a potent, intuitive torch singer.The biggest laugh of the night comes toward the end when a title card pops up dedicating IDGAF to “all the fuckboys who have done you wrong”. While this playground-chant anthem to empowerment doesn’t yet match the climactic New Rules in terms of streams and views, it is – perhaps tellingly – the song fans are raucously singing a capella as they spill out of the venue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad4a1f5abc4b419ae367d14c8d0043d50865ec66/0_78_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dd7c126b3723de43ebdefb085599d1eb 1240w","title":"manic street preachers resistance is futile review defeat and defiance","story":"At first glance, the title of Manic Street Preachers’ 13th album hits like one among the many ebullient slogans they’ve fired out over the years. All rock’n’roll is homosexual! Self-disgust is self-obsession! Resistance is futile! Yet their latest aphorism, an unlikely borrowing from hive-minded Star Trek villains the Borg, comes as loaded with melancholy as provocation. These songs, in which the rough-edged art-punk core of the Manics’ earliest days needles through mature, accomplished lushness, are heavy with a sense of the passing of all things and an uncertainty about their place in the world: “There will be no parades for the likes of us  The wars we fight are doomed to be lost,” frets the glitteringly sharp Sequels of Forgotten Wars.For every note of defeat, though, there’s a roar of defiance. People Give In also asserts that “people stay strong”, its music box-like guitar line ricocheting anxiously up and down before resolving into a sunburst-through-clouds riff’n’string chorus. International Blue’s tribute to Yves Klein, too, glows with bright energy and hope, while Dylan \u0026amp Caitlin, featuring the Anchoress, turns the darkness of the Thomases’ alcoholic romance into an effervescent homage to Don’t Go Breaking My Heart.Just as he did with 2014’s hard-to-follow triumph Futurology, Nicky Wire has hinted that Resistance Is Futile is “either a new era or the end”. “What is the future of the future?” riddles James Dean Bradfield on Hold Me Like a Heaven, in which “tattered manifestos litter the mind”. In place of certainties, comfort comes in the form of a ravishing chorus buoyed by warm woahh-ohhh-ohhhs. If this Sailing to Byzantium period didn’t suit them so well, you’d wish the Manics would stop being so hard on themselves. You can see why a band fond of grand statements, such as taking Noam Chomsky samples to the top of the pop charts, would question if just releasing more excellent Manic Street Preachers albums was enough. But their willingness to turn an ever-critical eye on themselves as well as on a changing world is what makes Resistance Is Futile so emotionally engaging, and more than enough to justify the future of their future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6620d6b4eca7bfedc01aa8e447a3343bed1ed1db/0_0_3328_2219/master/3328.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71a6e858752248e917a6627ba395b5e 1010w","title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Now 57, he has alternated in his career between big government jobs and lucrative positions in private practice, including with Lockheed Martin, the defense contractor, and Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, with $103bn in assets under management.Before he was FBI director, the defining moment in Comey’s career came in 2004, when he made a dramatic nighttime hospital-room intervention to stop the George W Bush White House from strong-arming the bedridden attorney general John Ashcroft into reauthorizing a controversial surveillance program. But he remained at the justice department after the program – a bulk collection of Americans’ internet metadata – was allowed to move forward under a different legal rubric.Leading up to his remarkably high-profile role in the 2016 presidential election, Comey had long enjoyed a reputation for fairness and public-minded integrity. “He doesn’t care about politics,” said Barack Obama upon nominating Comey to run the FBI in 2013. “He only cares about getting the job done.”Eric Holder, the former attorney general, said in 2003: “Jim is a chess player. He’s thinking, ‘What’s the impact going to be one month, two months, six months from now?’”Fifteen years later, that assessment, of Comey as a far-seeing strategist, has not aged particularly well. In July 2016, the FBI director took the highly unusual step of calling a news conference to discuss an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information over unsecured email. With the presidency seemingly at stake, Republicans howled at Comey’s announcement that the investigation had yielded no grounds for criminal prosecution. Democrats bridled at Comey’s assessment of Clinton’s email hygiene as “extremely careless”.The drama was just getting started. In October 2016, just 11 days before the election, the FBI director was back, with a letter notifying Congress that the bureau was examining newly discovered material in its investigation of Clinton’s email. That sounded pretty bad for Clinton, and it made headlines across the country in the campaign’s home stretch. Then, just two days before the election, Comey sent a final letter, announcing that the new material (which turned out to be mostly old material) contained nothing of prosecutorial significance.In the eyes of the Clinton camp, the result of Comey’s pen pal habit was plain. “James Comey cost her the election,” said Bill Clinton.Donald Trump had a somewhat different take. “I’ll tell you what: what he did, he brought back his reputation,” Trump told reporters of Comey’s October surprise. “He brought it back.”That attitude was not to last. Trump fired Comey as FBI director in June 2017, later saying he was thinking of “this Russia thing” – the investigation into Moscow’s interference in the 2016 election and Trump’s possible collusion – when he decided to do so. Comey’s dismissal set in train Robert Mueller’s appointment as special counsel, and the controversy has trailed Trump ever since.Comey is a father of five and a foster parent, married to his undergraduate sweetheart. He cycles, plays squash and teaches Sunday school."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2cfe2781bc849e8ffc8bfb827d05f569c11a91/0_188_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=5000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253999986c180b5bbedafbfc2eb6d8fd 10000w","title":"eternal sunshine las vegas perfect winter holiday","story":"From stargazing in the desert to world-famous pool parties, Las Vegas offers something for everyone looking to escape the cold and the rainWhen it’s cold, wet and generally miserable in the UK, why not head to Las Vegas for the flip side: sun, swimming pools and outdoor adventures. Though it’s a few hundred miles from the ocean, you’ll still find beaches, some of which are home to a vibrant daytime party scene. Nearby there are stunning natural wonders — mountains, lakes and hiking trails – perfect for all kinds of recreational activities. With so many options for fun in the sun, we take a look at some of the best.A full beach experience right on the Strip. Body surf in the wave pool, relax on a day bed, or take a gentle float down the lazy river. There are cabanas for all temperaments, whether you want seclusion or want to party. To really get away from the crowds, hire a cabana or gazebo with private pool and lounge area. The beach is family friendly, but head to the nearby Toptional Moorea club for a more grown-up experience.Mandalay Bay, 3950 S. Las Vegas Blvd.No need to stop the party just because the sun is shining – Wet Republic supplies the beats, dipping pools and festive atmosphere for all-day clubbing. A-list DJs, including Calvin Harris, Tiësto and Kaskade, keep the party going while there are a range of VIP options — take a bungalow for privacy and a personal jacuzzi, or be right in the action and book a banquette by the dance floor.MGM Grand, 3799 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Pick a pool. Caesars Palace has seven to choose from, each with its own theme. They all feature cabanas and day beds, so be guided by your mood. The Apollo pool receives the most sunlight, while the Jupiter is more secluded. Gamers will like the Fortuna, which has a swim-up blackjack table, while those looking for a European vibe should head for the Venus pool lounge. For the ultimate in relaxation book a massage session with Qua Baths \u0026amp Spa, which offers poolside services.Caesars Palace, 3570 S. Las Vegas Blvd.The Wynn’s day life unfolds at the Encore, a beach club that centres around its three-tiered pools. The DJ talent is world class, with the likes of the Chainsmokers, David Guetta and Diplo on the roster.

Bungalow residents get extra luxuries such as a cooling system, infinity pool and, crucially, a private bathroom.Wynn Las Vegas, 3131 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Just a half-hour’s drive from the Strip is Lake Mead, a recreation area known as the most erse in America. Visitors come for year-round activities, including jet skiing, paddleboarding, sport fishing and kayaking. There are a number of picnic spots throughout the park, and for a night away from the city’s hubbub, pitch a tent in one of the 10 campgrounds, or stay at one of the lakeside resorts.The Tank, as the Golden Nugget’s pool is called, can boast what no other can: here you can swim with sharks. Well, almost. An enclosed waterslide plunges nine metres, travelling through an aquarium filled with some 300 sea creatures, including said sharks and sting rays. The H2O bar supplies the drinks, while lounging in the sun is as strenuous as things need to get if you prefer. On the third floor is the Hideout, an infinity pool for over-21s with day beds, chaise lounges and luxury cabanas.Golden Nugget, 129 E. Fremont StreetA visit to the Hoover Dam is on many a bucket list, but to really experience the magnificence of the structure hop in a kayak. As you paddle out into the Colorado River, you’ll have an epic view as the 220-metre (726-foot) dam looms above. A number of companies offer day or half-day tours that take in highlights of the Black Canyon, including sauna caves and geothermal hot springs. Desert bighorn sheep, falcons and bald eagles are some of the wildlife that you might spot. The water is flat and suitable for beginners.The Dayclub is responsible for party duties at The Cosmopolitan in the day time. Spanning the multilevel Marquee Nightclub, there are also two pools, which is where you want to be to take in the first-class DJ action, including the likes of Dash Berlin, DJ Mustard and Tritonal.

There are more than 50 miles of trails to explore, four campgrounds and a range of activities from horseback riding to biking. The Lee Canyon resort offers winter skiing, snowshoeing and tubing, as well as disc golf during the warmer months. Other places to stay nearby include the well-appointed Mt Charleston Las Vegas resort.It might sit atop the Downtown Grand Hotel but the vibe at this pool deck is one of backyard party.

DJs and live entertainment also feature at weekends. As a bonus, there are superb views of downtown Las Vegas.Downtown Grand, 206 N. 3rd StreetFifteen miles west of Las Vegas sits the Red Rock Canyon Conservation Area, nearly 81,000 hectares (200,000 acres) of rugged beauty. It’s known for its hiking trails (there are 26 numbered hikes), which cater for all levels of fitness and reach from canyon floors to the highest points. A 13-mile paved road provides a scenic drive through stunning desert landscapes other activities include mountain biking, horseback riding and target shooting — it’s also a wonderful spot for stargazing.This luxurious but relaxed resort, away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, has two pools. The M Pool is the family-friendly version it has plenty of seating and cabanas for hire, and there are two large hot tubs on the pool deck. The over-21s pool club, DayDream, open at weekends and on holidays, is much more adult focused, with bar and bottle service available as well as top-name DJs providing the tunes.M Resort Spa Casino, 12300 S.

Others said it was simply time to untangle the municipality from the offensive symbol. Their view was countered by those who argued that the street had been named in the 1920s, when swastikas were associated with peace rather than a symbol of Adolf Hitler, the Nazi party and white supremacy. Others cited the personal expenses that those living on the street would be forced to incur if they had to change their address on all of their documentation. Soon after, a local association put the issue to a vote. By a slim majority – 25 votes to 20 – residents voted to keep the name. “It’s 100 years old. It’s our township’s history,” Lori Wyszynski told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in December. “I’m tired of this world – what we’re living in right now – and everyone (saying), ‘Let’s smash the statues, let’s change the school names, let’s just burn history books.’” The municipal matter soon spilled on to the national stage, after B’nai Brith Canada launched a petition urging authorities to rename the street. “There is no place for a street with the name of a symbol of antisemitic hatred in modern Canada,” Michael Mostyn of the organisation said this week in a statement. After a December council meeting that heard from 14 delegations, councillors in Puslinch Township voted 4-1 not to intervene in the matter, citing the vote that had already been held by residents. On Tuesday, two residents of the municipality sought to overturn that decision, filing an appeal with the Ontario court of justice. “We were just out of options,” Randy Guzar, a resident of the street and one of the lawsuit’s applicants, told the Cambridge Times. “Having this name in contemporary society is just completely unacceptable to us. In fact, it’s a name drenched in evil.” Their appeal argues that township’s authorities were wrong to rely on the vote held by residents, alleging in court documents that it was rife with procedural errors and bias.Puslinch Township council and the local group that held the vote, Bayview Cottagers Association, have 30 days to respond to the legal challenge. The road in Puslinch is not the province’s only reference to the symbol northern Ontario is home to the small town of Swastika, incorporated in the early 1900s and named after a local gold mine that embraced the symbol as one signifying good luck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55208c5730716e7e4842428ebd95d14f6c951633/0_176_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d843c5a4fe41411e2e8163689ee65a70 2600w","title":"marielle franco fiancee rio brazil monica benicio","story":"Mônica Benício was due to marry the black feminist LGBT activist next year before she was shot down in a Brazilian street. Her killing has sparked an outpouring of reverence and revoltIt has been a month since the late-night knock at Mônica Benício’s door: a friend arriving to announce the love of her life was not coming home.“I ran at her shouting: ‘Where’s Marielle? Where’s Marielle?’” the 32-year-old architect recalled. “I screamed and I shouted. I smashed part of the house … None of it seemed real … It was like I was having a nightmare and would wake up at any moment. But as more and more friends arrived it became more and more real. More concrete. More desperate.”Less than two miles away, Marielle Franco, a 38-year-old activist and rising political star known for defending Rio’s black, LGBT and favela communities, lay slumped on the backseat of a white Chevrolet having been shot in the head four times as she returned from a debate in downtown Rio.Benício pummeled her friend with questions: “Was it an attempted robbery? Are they taking her to the doctor’s? Can they help her?”“No,” came the reply. “She was dead and there wasn’t … anything to be done.”Weeks after the murder of the Rio councillor and her driver, Anderson Gomes, her partner perched on a sofa in their home in north Rio and sobs as she relived the events of 14 March. Next year – after a 14-year, on-off romance – the couple were to marry.Symbols of the couple’s shared passion for activism and the arts pepper the airy lounge: murals of Frida Kahlo and Angela Davis records by politically charged composers such as Chico Buarque and Mercedes Sosa and contemporary black artists like Marina Iris and her group ÉPreta a portrait of Florestan Fernandes, a Brazilian sociologist who rose from poverty to write seminal works on race and democracy – issues central to Franco’s mission. Franco’s killing has sparked an outpouring of reverence and revolt. Brazilian newspapers are filled with stories about her life demonstrators have swarmed on to the streets to chant: “Marielle presente!” – Rio’s answer to “Je suis Charlie!”“There are two Marielles: the one we are all out on the streets shouting is alive and the Marielle who is my companion and who I still haven’t managed to mourn,” said Benício. “I still haven’t accepted this has happened.”At dawn on Saturday supporters will mark one month since Franco’s murder by decorating public squares with balloons, flowers and banners.Yet Franco’s killers, who many suspect belong to the increasingly powerful paramilitary groups that control swaths of Rio, have yet to be caught. Authorities claim progress is being made but have said little about the state of their inquiry. “We are advancing, but under strict secrecy,” said Homero Freitas Filho, a public prosecutor on a taskforce pursuing the killers.Franco’s murder has punctuated a dismal chapter in the contemporary history of this spectacular but troubled beach city.Almost a decade ago, the then president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who last week began a prison sentence for a disputed corruption conviction, wept with joy after Rio was chosen to host the 2016 Olympics. Since then, however, Brazil’s “Marvellous City” has tumbled into a whirlpool of overlapping crises – economic, political and security – from which it is struggling to emerge before October elections. “The government is coming to an end with the former governor under arrest the former president of the legislative assembly under arrest the other president of the legislative assembly under arrest the leader of the government under arrest and the current governor waiting to be arrested. This is a very serious metastasis and has a real impact in people’s lives. There is no government.” Benício, who met Franco in the colossal Maré favela where both women were raised, recalled teasing her about the wisdom of ing into this morass of political “filth”. But she said the seemingly endless reports of bloodshed and sleaze had fired up Franco, not discouraged her. Franco was convinced Brazilian politics needed renewal: more black faces, more female faces, more LGBT faces, more favela faces, and – with Brazil mired in what some call the biggest corruption scandal in history – more honest faces.In 2016, after years of grassroots activism, she ran for office with the slogan “I am because we are”. Freixo, Franco’s boss since 2007, said he was thrilled by his protege’s move: “The world is crying out for Marielles.” Rio agreed, electing Franco with nearly 47,000 votes – the fifth-highest number received by a city councillor. At her swearing in on 1 January 2017 the young, black, gay, female, favela-born politician vowed to “oxygenate” Rio’s stale political scene. Not everybody seems to have welcomed Franco’s triumph. Friends and relatives are convinced she was the victim of a political assassination, a theory authorities say they are aggressively pursuing. “I don’t question at all that it was a political crime,” said Benício. “She was our only black female councillor – a black, lesbian woman from the favelas occupying a position of power that’s predominantly reserved for the white men who make up this ‘Brazilian elite’.”Freixo, who has long lived under armed guard because of his fight against Rio’s mafia, agreed. “The only thing I don’t know is what politics lay behind it who ordered it what the motivation was and what the message was.”He admitted police faced a devilishly complex investigation. “We know this case won’t be solved with the speed … our anguish demands. But I think it will be solved.”Determined to keep Franco’s cause alive, Benício has thrown herself into public activism, addressing politicians in Brasília and taking to the stage with Lula and Katy Perry in Rio.She said her first task, however, was simply surviving. For a fortnight after the crime, Benício said, she was unable to consume solid food. “Eating meant accepting I would have to go on.” Benício said she clung to the memory of her final moments with Franco after a rare lunch together at her office. “I gave her a quick kiss, got into the lift – and the last image I have,” she said, pausing to compose herself, “is of her stood there in the door, smiling and waving goodbye, and the lift door closing.”The next time she set eyes on her partner was through a small glass window in Franco’s redwood coffin. “It didn’t look like her … Her face was a little swollen but there was nothing grotesque or morbid. It’s just that I couldn’t see my woman in that face … So I still can’t believe it.”“I’m waiting for her to come back,” Benício admitted, her voice trembling. “Any time now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37361bf174f25547edfc8c5daff77dc2dbd6f934/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70efd2143d4ca1eb1455505ddc3af593 1240w","title":"uk gypsy camp review criticised for fuelling prejudice","story":"Human rights groups say government has failed to address shortage of sites for TravellersLeading human rights groups have criticised a government review of the laws surrounding unauthorised Gypsy and Traveller camps for reinforcing prejudice against nomadic communities, after the death of Henry Vincent brought national focus to the tensions between travellers and nearby communities in the UK.Vincent, who was fatally stabbed during an altercation after he broke into the home of 78-year-old Richard Osborn-Brooks, reportedly belonged to the Traveller community near Hither Green, south-east London. Flowers and cards laid in tribute to Vincent outside Osborn-Brooks’ house have been repeatedly torn down and replaced. One resident shouted: “These are scumbags, scumbags, scumbags. We’ve had enough in this country of scumbags,” as he demolished the shrine. Last week the housing minister, Dominic Raab, announced a consultation on the powers available to local authorities, the police and landowners to deal with Gypsies and Travellers who settle on land without permission. The announcement came following calls by MPs in October for increased eviction powers.In a letter to Raab, organisations including Liberty, the Race Equality Foundation and the British Institute of Human Rights criticised the government for failing to focus on the root cause of the problem – the shortage of sites provided by local authorities for Gypsies and Travellers.The letter’s signatories, which also include leading Gypsy and Traveller groups, expressed concern that the review and the questions chosen to guide the consultation process would “reinforce and further anti-Gypsyism sweeping across Europe”. They said increased eviction powers could worsen health and educational inequalities for Gypsies and Travellers, which are already among the worst for any group in the UK.In a statement announcing the consultation last week, Raab said: “The vast majority of the travelling community are decent and law-abiding people. But we are particularly concerned about illegal Traveller encampments, and some of the antisocial behaviour they can give rise to. We must promote a tolerant society and make sure there are legal sites available for Travellers, but equally, the rule of law must be applied to everyone.”Gypsy and Traveller bodies have argued that there is already enough legislation to tackle anti-social behaviour from any person, whether they are in the travelling or settled communities. Michelle Gavin, the projects manager at FFT, said the government announcement had chosen to focus on anti-social behaviour by a small number of people rather than “local authorities’ nationwide failure to identify land for Traveller sites”.“The vast majority of Gypsies and Travellers who are living on unauthorised land are not doing this because they want to,” she said. “Would you want to live in a public space with next to no privacy? Would you want to get regularly evicted? Would you want to be the subject of press articles about ‘Traveller invasions’?”She added: “It is a disgrace that in 2018, so many Gypsy and Traveller families cannot access a site to live on and therefore cannot access basic water and sanitation and often experience uninterrupted access to education and healthcare.”Jim Davis, the manager of the equality and social unit at the Traveller Movement, said the language used in the announcement was “criminalising the vulnerable”. “Raab talks about illegal encampments and the undertone of that is that this is criminal activity,” he said. “It’s not a criminal activity. These people are homeless. If you had people sleeping in a doorway would you call them an illegal sleeper? Of course you wouldn’t.”Abiline McShane, a 51-year-old Romany Gypsy living in Birmingham, used to make her living running a bouncy castle at fairs across the country during the summer, and selling rugs in winter. That changed in 2012 when her then-six-year-old daughter Leyla Grace fell from a 12ft landing on to a concrete floor and fractured her skull. As Birmingham city council couldn’t provide her with a site to put her trailer on, she set up an unauthorised encampment close to a hospital to focus on getting treatment for her daughter’s brain injury. She was evicted from the site after a year and given a council house in the Yardley Wood area, with a drive to put her trailer on. “That’s not my home,” she says, sitting at the table in her caravan and pointing to the house. “This is my home.”McShane expected to be in the house for only six months before finding a bay for her trailer in a council-run camp, but five years later she is still there. “We’re not asking for special treatment. They give people council houses. Why can’t they just give us a space on a camp? It’s cheaper to build a space on a camp than it is to build a council house.”She was furious to read about the government consultation on unauthorised encampments. “If it was any other community then they would call this racist, but because it’s us, no one even bats an eyelid,” she says. She says has had abuse shouted at her and stones thrown at her windows, and that if more camps aren’t built, community tensions will only get worse.McShane says her ancestors left India in the 1500s and that her family has been in the UK for hundreds of years. “We are the original migrants,” she says. “We’re still compromising our way of life by living on camps. If we had it our way, we’d be living by streams and under trees.

Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsState funding of nearly €1 million a year is to be withheld from Scouting Ireland until concerns over the governance of the organisation are resolved, Minister for Children Katherine Zappone has said.Ms Zappone said she was “very concerned” with the organisation’s handling of an allegation made by a female leader in 2016 about a rape during a camping trip seven years earlier.“In light of the serious nature of recent media coverage the Minister has decided to withhold funding from Scouting Ireland until such time as she is satisfied with the governance of the organisation,” a spokesman for Ms Zappone told The Irish Times.Scouting Ireland received €876,337 in funding from the department last year, and more than €9 million since 2010. The organisation has 40,000 juvenile members, and grants from the department make up a significant portion of its income.There was particular concern that despite advice from gardaí, the alleged offender was reinstated without undergoing Garda vetting. The man had been suspended while the investigation was being conducted.The male leader was reinstated last year, after the Director of Public Prosecutions did not proceed with the case. He was promoted to a more senior role after a number of months.Details from the confidential review into the handling of the case, carried out by child safety expert Ian Elliott, were reported yesterday by The Irish Times.The decision to withhold future State funding until governance concerns are resolved is likely to provoke internal turmoil ahead of the organisation’s national council on Saturday.A spokesman for Ms Zappone said she was not previously aware the male leader had been reinstated “without further Garda vetting” nor of the inidual’s “subsequent promotion”.A summary of Mr Elliott’s review, obtained by The Irish Times in February, found the handling of the rape allegation was “deeply flawed”. In early March, Ms Zappone received a requested copy of Mr Elliott’s report into Scouting Ireland’s safeguarding policies.However, Scouting Ireland chief executive Dr John Lawlor said the case review was being withheld, due to an ongoing independent investigation into its findings, which “we are very anxious not to prejudice”, he said.Correspondence between Ms Zappone and Scouting Ireland was obtained under the Freedom of Information act.Dr Lawlor has agreed to appear before the Oireachtas committee on Children and Youth Affairs to answer questions on the organisation’s child protection standards. Committee chair Alan Farrell TD said he was “deeply concerned” with the details of Mr Elliott’s review.Mr McCann, who is running unopposed for a second term as chief scout at the organisation’s national council, criticised the legitimacy of the internal group’s recommendation, stating it was “an ad hoc team of senior personnel”, in a statement to the organisation’s membership on Wednesday.The crisis group “had no role, authority or mandate to make any recommendation”, he said.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3460020.1523612445!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ulster rugby and irfu officials under pressure from sponsors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaddy Jackson was cleared of the charges on March 28th. Photograph: PacemakerUlster Rugby and IRFU officials are coming under increasing pressure from sponsors to effectively deal with “issues” raised during the trial of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding. Official Ulster Rugby shirt sponsor Bank of Ireland (BoI) has said it is “highly concerned” about the “serious behaviour and conduct issues” that emerged in the trial involving the two players, who, at Belfast Crown Court last month, were cleared of raping the same woman in 2016.The bank, a key sponsor of the club for 20 years, has been in touch with Ulster Rugby chief executive Shane Logan regarding the case.“It is of paramount importance to Bank of Ireland that our sponsorship activity aligns with and supports our core values, and reflects positively on Bank of Ireland through association,” a BoI statement said. “We understand that an internal review is under way. We expect this review to be robust, to fully address the issues raised, and that decisions will be taken – and policies and protocols be put in place – that fully address the issues that have arisen.”Following the conclusion of the trial on March 28th when both men were cleared of all charges, and two of their friends were also acquitted on related charges, Ulster and the IRFU said they were conducting an internal review into the two players who have been “relieved of all duties” since the legal process began. The degrading and offensive WhatsApp messages exchanged between the players and their friends, including another rugby player Craig Gilroy, who is also subject to the internal review over a message he sent Mr Olding, were under intense scrutiny during the trial and since its conclusion.Street demonstrations have taken place in cities across Ireland, and a feminist protest planned for outside Ulster’s King Stadium in south Belfast is scheduled for Friday evening. King, which is headquartered in Cavan, is the main sponsor of Ulster Rugby. It has been a partner since 1999 and in the summer of 2014 announced a 10-year agreement for the naming rights of the stadium. A spokesman for the company did not respond to a number requests for a statement. A spokeswoman for main kit sponsor Kukri Sports said: “I have no comment.”A spokeswoman for another official shirt sponsor, BT, said: “As a sponsor of the team, we have been in contact with Ulster Rugby. “We note that the players concerned will continue to be relieved of all duties while the IRFU and Ulster Rugby internal review is under way, and we await the findings.”A spokesman for shirt sponsor Go Power said: “Our legal team have been liaising with their PR department.” All other “official” or “domestic” sponsors listed on the Ulster Rugby website were contacted by The Irish Times on Thursday. SONI (System Operator for Northern Ireland) spokeswoman Natasha Sayee said its concerns had been expressed to Ulster Rugby and it awaited the outcome of the review. “As sponsors of the Ulster Rugby Premiership, we seek to support the values of respect, integrity and inclusivity at community and grassroots level,” she said. “It is vital to SONI that the outcome of the review addresses all of these issues.”Danske Bank is the official sponsor of the Ulster Schools’ Cup competition held each year from November to March, plus the Girls Schools’ Cup and High Schools’ Trophy. A statement said: “Danske Bank has not taken a formal position on the matter, nor have we had any contact with Ulster Rugby.”A Moy Park spokeswoman said: “The company is an official supplier to Ulster Rugby. It would be inappropriate to comment further as Ulster Rugby and the IRFU are conducting an internal review.”A Dale Farm spokeswoman said: “Dale Farm fully respects Ulster Rugby and IRFU’s current internal investigation and as such is not in a position to comment on this matter.”An Ulster Carpets spokeswoman said: “Ulster Carpets are fully aware of the situation and will be awaiting the outcome of the review being carried out by Ulster Rugby and the IRFU before making any comment.”An Abbey Insurance spokeswoman said: “Thank you for the opportunity, but at this stage Abbey Insurance is not making any comment in relation to this matter.”A Deep River Rock spokeswoman said it would not be commenting on this matter. A Maxol spokesperson said: “Maxol sponsors the Ulster Mini Rugby Festivals programme which aims to give young players aged 6 - 12 years old their first taste of the sport as well as learning the basic skills that go behind it. On other matters we don’t feel it is appropriate to comment at this time.”A response from the following companies was not available at the time of publication: Subway Ernst and Young Bavarian A\u0026ampL Goodbody Tobermore Concrete Products Ltd Fonacab Argento CD Group Heineken Millar McCall Wylie First Trust Bank and Kerr’s Tyres.An Ulster Rugby statement said: “The IRFU and Ulster Rugby have advised that a review process in relation to this matter is underway and it would be inappropriate to comment on any matter pertaining to that process until it is completed.”In the “sponsorship opportunities” section of the Ulster Rugby website it says it and the IRFU Ulster Branch are “committed to building a team from grass roots level up, making this the perfect opportunity for sponsors keen to harness a community ethos, not just in Northern Ireland but with border counties in Ulster”.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Having taken Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos, it brings me such joy to be able to witness again, the next chapter in this wonderful love story.\u0026quotThe photographer has the title His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.He is descended from an influential Polish family who received the hereditary title of prince of the Holy Roman Empire from Emperor Ferdinand III in the 17th century.Mr Lubomirski, who was born in England but now lives in New York, was given his first camera aged 11 by his stepfather.He has since made a career photographing the rich and famous from Beyonce and Gwyneth Paltrow to Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman and Scarlett Johansson.Harry, the fifth in line to the throne, and Ms Markle, the US actress, will wed on Saturday, May 19 at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle.The couple, who announced their engagement in November, are planning their own wedding celebration that “reflects the characters of the bride and groom”Days until the Royal WeddingFrom flowers to seating plans, the pair are taking charge of a ceremony designed to incorporate both families, their wide circle of friends, and welcome the public into their lives. Click here for the latest news about plans for their big day.As they say their vows in front of the watching world, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have a lifetime of Royal tours ahead of them as a married couple. They will waste no time getting started, it seems.Kensington Palace announced last month that the newlyweds are to undertake a tour of Windsor as their first trip as a married couple, to greet well-wishers who are expected to turn out from all over the world to see them.Prince Harry and Ms Markle have already released a series of updates about their day - and how they hope to “share their celebrations with the public”.Decisions include a carriage ride through Windsor, taking place straight after the St George’s Chapel ceremony and before their reception.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesThe journey is designed to allow members of the public to see the couple in the flesh, while they are still dressed in their finery, in what is likely to be one of the most photographed occasions of the year.In a series of updates about the wedding, Kensington Palace also announced that the wedding service, at St George\u0027s Chapel at midday, will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd David Conner.The Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Revd. and Rt Hon. Justin Welby, will, as expected, officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding serviceAt 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle, who will receive new titles reflecting their married status on the day, will leave Windsor Castle by carriage, via Castle Hill, along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for their reception.“They hope this short journey will provide an opportunity for more people to come together around Windsor and to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day,” a spokesman said.Guests from the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate with the first of two receptions.The second, for close friends and family, will be thrown in the evening by Prince Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales.A view of St George\u0026#39s Hall, at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will hold a reception after their weddingThe timings should go some way to allaying the fears of those concerned about a clash with the FA Cup final, with the football match likely to kick off at 5.30pm. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: “Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle are hugely grateful for the many good wishes they have received since announcing their engagement. “They are very much looking forward to the day and to being able to share their celebrations with the public.”While the final arrangements for the wedding are expected to reflect the personalities of the Prince and Ms Markle with some unique elements, the basic outline of celebrations, as announced by the palace, follows tradition.Other Royal couples, including the Earl and Countess of Wessex, have also undertaken a carriage procession after their Windsor weddings, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoying the same two-tier receptions following their 2011 nuptials.While their reception ended with an energetic Prince Harry rounding younger guests onto a minibus to continue the party into the early hours, the calming  influence of Ms Markle may see a more sophisticated conclusion to the Prince’s own day.After announcing their engagement, the couple gave an insight into their 16-month romance in a BBC interview - and described how they met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.Ms Markle told how she could not wait to say \u0026quotyes\u0026quot to the prince when Harry got down on one knee a few weeks ago as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, Prince Harry said: \u0026quotThe fact that I fell in love with Meghan so incredibly quickly was sort of confirmation to me that everything, all the stars were aligned, everything was just perfect.\u0026quotIt was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.\u0026quot Full interview: Harry and Meghan reveal engagement joyA few months into the relationship, Harry said he had to have \u0026quotsome pretty frank conversations\u0026quot with Meghan about how her life may change when she entered the royal family.He added: \u0026quotBut I know that at the end of the day she chooses me, and I choose her, and therefore whatever we have to tackle together or inidually we\u0027ll always be us together as a team, so I think she\u0027s capable... she\u0027s capable of anything.\u0026quotPlease review our commenting policyDonald Trump hits back at  \u0026#39weak slime ball\u0026#39 James Comey over lurid claims in new bookRussia may ban Scotch whisky in retaliation for Western action in SyriaDuke of Edinburgh waves as he leaves hospital 11 days after hip operationHuge wave of poppies takes over Fort Nelson in Hampshire Probation service failed to protect woman who complained her convicted murderer ex-partner was trying to kill herFriday the 13th: How cyclones, a Buckingham Palace bombing and asteroids have fed the superstitionUS embassy in Cambodia fires 32 staff for allegedly sharing pornography in chat groupPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsBeleaguered head of Open University resigns with \u0026#39immediate effect\u0026#39Comment: James Comey\u0026#39s cheap shots against Donald Trump prove he was unfit to lead the FBIPope gives holy boost to race car ahead of Rome\u0026#39s first ever E-PrixTube strike over sacking of driver who \u0026#39drove through three red lights\u0026#39 A quarter of Rohingya refugee children are malnourishedWhy Friday the 13th creates peculiar bargains – and how to take advantageWhat happens next in Syria – could Britain be drawn into World War Three?Nawaz Sharif: Former Pakistani PM barred from politics for lifeItaly the weak link as West forges Syria planAlfie Evans: Police called as hundreds stage protest outside hospitalRussia warns the US that Syrian airstrikes could spark warWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/11/TELEMMGLPICT000159520386_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqx9qSHbeosvxfwsJrZyLDI2XVWWR_34yhrF6Y8rFg0mk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"quarter rohingya refugee children malnourished","story":"One in four Rohingya refugee children are malnourishedA quarter of Rohingya refugee children are suffering malnutrition and there are fears the coming rainy season could bring infectious disease outbreaks, putting their health further at risk. A survey of children in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh found that 24 per cent were malnourished – and nearly seven per cent severely so.Chronic malnutrition can lead to stunting, which has lasting effects on brain development and prospects in later life. Since August 2017, nearly 700,000 Rohingya refugees have fled an upsurge in unrest in Myanmar, putting a huge strain on existing camps in Bangladesh.

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition.

After drivers are trained, when they get to a red signal, they are supposed to stop, wait for it to go green then go through.\u0026quotIn his first 11 weeks after training, the driver went through three red lights.\u0026quotAfter his first time we gave him three days of training with an instructor, after his second time we gave him five days of training and then we gave him five days of rest.\u0026quotAccording to TfL, they offered the driver a new role on the station floor, after assessing that keeping him as a driver would mean a possible danger to live.The spokesperson explained: \u0026quotWe had a meeting with him, as agreed with the trade union, in which we agreed with him he would go to a station staff role- that\u0027s where he came from in the first place, he was station staff.\u0026quotIf a driver goes through a red light, there could be a train in front of them which gives a risk of collision. It endangers customers and endangers that driver and other staff members.\u0026quotFinn Brennan, ASLEF’s organiser on the Underground, said the dispute is over a lack of meetings with TfL.He said: \u0026quotWe have repeatedly offered to meet LU to discuss this dispute but, instead of getting around the table, they have sent a stream of letters threatening legal action to try to prevent our members from exercising their democratic right to strike.\u0026quotWhen management are intent on getting their way by threats and intimidation then we need to take a strong stand to protect our agreements and ensure fair treatment at work.\u0026quotDonald Trump hits back at  \u0026#39weak slime ball\u0026#39 James Comey over lurid claims in new bookRussia may ban Scotch whisky in retaliation for Western action in SyriaDuke of Edinburgh waves as he leaves hospital 11 days after hip operationHuge wave of poppies takes over Fort Nelson in Hampshire Probation service failed to protect woman who complained her convicted murderer ex-partner was trying to kill herFriday the 13th: How cyclones, a Buckingham Palace bombing and asteroids have fed the superstitionUS embassy in Cambodia fires 32 staff for allegedly sharing pornography in chat groupPrince Harry and Meghan Markle choose Alexi Lubomirski as wedding photographerPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsBeleaguered head of Open University resigns with \u0026#39immediate effect\u0026#39Comment: James Comey\u0026#39s cheap shots against Donald Trump prove he was unfit to lead the FBIPope gives holy boost to race car ahead of Rome\u0026#39s first ever E-PrixA quarter of Rohingya refugee children are malnourishedWhy Friday the 13th creates peculiar bargains – and how to take advantageWhat happens next in Syria – could Britain be drawn into World War Three?Nawaz Sharif: Former Pakistani PM barred from politics for lifeItaly the weak link as West forges Syria planAlfie Evans: Police called as hundreds stage protest outside hospitalRussia warns the US that Syrian airstrikes could spark warWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/07/19/winter-storm-quinn.jpg","title":"bees decline business supply chain un cambridge university asda pepsico","story":"Businesses face the threat of declining bee populations\u0026nbspand other pollinating species crucial to the development of cropsBusinesses face a shortage of raw materials and a drop in the quality of crop as the number of bees decline worldwide, a new report warns.Approximately three quarters of crops around the world depend on pollination, all of which could soon be threatened as more than a third of wild bee and butterfly species face extinction, according to a joint study by the UN, the University of East Anglia and Cambridge University.Major businesses, including Asda, the Body Shop, Mars and Pepsico, say they are unable to take action largely because of uncertainty around which crops and regions are vulnerable to the decline in pollinators such as bees.National Grid profit warning after £140m hit from extreme weather“The role pollinators play – be it tiny midges for cocoa or squirrels for coconut – is not well understood and can be taken for granted,” says Jos van Oostrum, director of sustainable solutions at chocolate and confectionary maker Mars.Cocoa, a vital ingredient in the production of chocolate, is at particular risk from a declining number of bees and other species that help spread pollen.The risks of a shortfall in raw materials not only prove a challenge for food production, but also the sourcing of ingredients for beauty products.“The importance of pollination for natural raw materials is increasingly a priority for us,” said the Body Shop’s sustainable sourcing manager Francesca Brkic.“Bees are very important to us and we recognise the positive impact that comes out of sustainable trade to supply chains that depend on pollinators as well as communities who produce honey and beeswax as an integral part of their livelihoods.”The UN also called for the introduction of new industry standards and policies that protect pollinating insects and animals to be put into place as a safeguard for raw materials and supply chains.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In the last year, bitcoin has risen by over 500 per cent in value.At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at around $7,700 on the Coinbase exchange.In recent weeks, bitcoin has slowly fallen in value amid fears that the highs seen in late 2017 were the result of a bubble. At its peak last December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000.Other leading cryptocurrencies have mirrored bitcoin\u0027s return to form, with ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and EOS all experiencing gains of more than 10 per cent over the last 24 hours.Bitcoin Cash feud deepens as famous @Bitcoin Twitter account mysteriouWill bitcoin recover from its worst ever start to a year?Cryptocurrency analysts recently suggested that bitcoin\u0027s recent demise was only temporary, predicting a turn in fortunes for the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency.Speaking to The Independent earlier this month, one expert said the price of bitcoin could return to its 2017 highs and even push beyond.“The price has been driven by speculators and they suddenly got cold feet but there’s considerable effort going on behind the scenes, including new underlying technology that is powering faster transactions,” said Michael Jackson, the former COO of Skype who now works in the cryptocurrency space.“Meanwhile, regulators seem open-minded and are now working to eliminate the risks for consumers. So I see no reason why bitcoin shouldn\u0027t’t fulfil its dream. And if it does then recent price falls will appear trivial.This forecast comes in contrast to comments from economists at Barclay\u0027s bank this week, which labelled bitcoin\u0027s 2017 price rise an infection that spread like a disease.Such analysis would suggest that the falling price meant the disease had been treated and gains of that scale would not be seen again.“We developed a theoretical model of an asset price with a pool of speculative investors and compared it with actual bitcoin price behaviour to see what it might imply for the future dynamics, the economists said.The model has clear parallels with compartmental models of the spread of an infectious disease in epidemiology.Follow our bitcoin live blog for the latest updates.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

A survey found 31 per cent of people are paying out £4,300 a year on average, increasing pressure on their own retirement plans and income.They are providing financial support to three people on average with their or their partner’s children the most likely (56 per cent) to be receiving money. Number of people retiring after age 70 doubles since 2010 Among those paying for younger generations, a quarter said they were giving money to grandchildren, 8 per cent to their parents and 2 per cent to their grandparents.Nearly one in five expecting to retire this year estimate they provide more than £500 a month to family members.   The money is most commonly used to cover everyday living costs such as food and travel, according to 27 per cent of those who give money monthly. However, 23 per cent say they are providing financial support to help with university education fees and living costs while 22 per cent say some of the cash goes to help with getting on the property ladder.Women are slightly more generous than men, expecting to provide an average of £374 a month to family members, compared to men who will hand over £25 less every month. Stan Russell, retirement income expert at Prudential, said that rising financial pressures such as the cost of university education and buying a home meant that providing financial support to family members continues well into retirement.  “While it’s understandable so many people want to financially support family members, it is important to make sure they have enough money set aside themselves to cover their own living costs and don’t put their retirement at risk,” he said.  The study found that a quarter of people retiring this year have families but don’t provide them with any financial support, while 43 per cent do not have any dependents.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody.

Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices.

It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A survey found 31 per cent of people are paying out £4,300 a year on average, increasing pressure on their own retirement plans and income.They are providing financial support to three people on average with their or their partner’s children the most likely (56 per cent) to be receiving money. Number of people retiring after age 70 doubles since 2010 Among those paying for younger generations, a quarter said they were giving money to grandchildren, 8 per cent to their parents and 2 per cent to their grandparents.Nearly one in five expecting to retire this year estimate they provide more than £500 a month to family members.   The money is most commonly used to cover everyday living costs such as food and travel, according to 27 per cent of those who give money monthly. However, 23 per cent say they are providing financial support to help with university education fees and living costs while 22 per cent say some of the cash goes to help with getting on the property ladder.Women are slightly more generous than men, expecting to provide an average of £374 a month to family members, compared to men who will hand over £25 less every month. Stan Russell, retirement income expert at Prudential, said that rising financial pressures such as the cost of university education and buying a home meant that providing financial support to family members continues well into retirement.  “While it’s understandable so many people want to financially support family members, it is important to make sure they have enough money set aside themselves to cover their own living costs and don’t put their retirement at risk,” he said.  The study found that a quarter of people retiring this year have families but don’t provide them with any financial support, while 43 per cent do not have any dependents.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Poor Coleridge was moved from a tip to a tip - they put the coffins in a convenient space which was dry and secure, and quite suitable, bricked them up and forgot about them, and never did anything about the rest of the space.James Comey\u0027s new book likens Donald Trump to a mob bossMaya Angelou\u0027s extraordinary life and most beloved poemAccording to the Guardian report, the coffins are barely visible through a ventilation block in the wall, which was built in the 1960s, and were discovered during an excavation which uncovered the wine vault entrance. Coleridge suffered from depression, poor health and drug and alcohol addiction in his life. His final 18 years were spend lodging across the green from the church with a doctor he hoped could cure him. He died aged 61 in July 1834.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There is no dogmatism.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13He added: What creates the problem in Ireland, is the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU but also to leave what it is not obligatory to leave, that\u0027s to say the single market and the customs union.The EU said last month that it is prepared to shift its position if the UK backs down over its plans for a hard Brexit.Guidelines published by the European Council ahead of the second round of Brexit talks said their position was “compatible with the positions stated by the UK” but added: If these positions were to evolve, the Union will be prepared to reconsider its offer.Sticking to EU law \u0027vastly\u0027 better than making our own, say businessesBrexit \u0027one of saddest moments\u0027 in recent European history, says TuskEU to make UK sign pledge not to slash environment rules after BrexitBarry Gardiner describes key part of Labour\u0027s Brexit plan as b******sMr Barnier’s confirmation was welcomed by anti-Brexit campaigners.Labour MP Chris Leslie, a supporter of the Open Britain group, said: These comments by Michel Barnier demonstrate yet again how ludicrous it was for the Government to take single market membership off the table in the Brexit negotiations.Leaving the single market will lead to huge economic damage, years of austerity and will starve our public services such as the NHS of vital resources.If the cost of leaving the single market and of Brexit is too high, people are entitled to keep an open mind about whether it\u0027s the right path for the country.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He should have had the decency to refer himself rather than sweep this under the carpet.”The Health Secretary said his failure to declare a business interest with both Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs interests was down to “honest administrative mistakes” and that he did not gain financially as a result.A spokeswoman for Mr Hunt said: “These were honest administrative mistakes which have already been rectified.“Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.“Jeremy declared the interest to them after the company was set up.“They advised that as it was a shell company with no assets or value, it should only be registered when it became operational.“As such, Jeremy presumed the same rules applied to Parliamentary declarations.“Although there was no personal gain involved, Jeremy accepts these mistakes are his responsibility and has apologised to the parliamentary authorities.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

If the election were held today, frankly, I think Republicans would lose both,” the conservative pollster said on Fox News.Republican governor warns party is at risk of Democratic gainsRepublican finally concedes special election in ominous sign for TrumpHillary Clinton says \u0027the Russians are coming\u0027 ahead of midtermsRepublicans fear a \u0027bloodbath\u0027 in midterm electionsAmerica’s best known public opinion guru partially heaped blame on Mr Trump for the Republican Party\u0027s dwindling electoral hopes.“If Donald Trump wants to keep the Republican Congress, he has to differentiate when he’s attacking Congress in general versus the Republicans in Congress,” he said.“Differentiate when he’s attacking the press versus when he feels he’s not getting a fair shake”.Mr Luntz argued the economy had flourished under the Trump administration but that the president failed to gain proper recognition for it. He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesShi\u0027ite pilgrims carry a symbolic casket outside Imam Moussa al-Kadhim\u0027s shrine to mark the anniversary of his death in Baghdad, IraqSeasonal winds washed tons of debris ashore at Matahari Terbit beach, near Sanur, Bali, Indonesia.Syrian onlookers gather around rescue teams clearing the rubble at the site of an explosion of unknown origin which wrecked a multi-storey building the previous night in the war-battered country\u0027s northwestern city of Idlib.

According to Riverside County Sheriffs, David Allen Turpin and Louise Anna Turpin held 13 malnourished children ranging in age from 2 to 29 captive in their Perris, California home. Deputies were alerted after a 17-year-old daughter escaped by jumping through a window shortly before dawn, carrying a de-activated mobile phone from which she was able to call 911 for help.

He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.
