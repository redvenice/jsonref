Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Cabinet may meet as early as Friday to approve the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions, which is likely to begin next week.While no meeting has been formally scheduled yet, it is understood that arrangements will be put in place quickly if advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on Thursday is favourable to a quick reopening.The Cabinet holds its regular weekly meeting tomorrow, while Nphet is scheduled to meet on Thursday to consider the latest modelling, the situation in hospitals and the prospects for reopening.If the Nphet advice is favourable towards reopening, the Cabinet could decide on Friday to begin lifting restrictions in the middle of next week, with an announcement to that effect by Taoiseach Micheál Martin following the meeting on Friday evening.It is expected that the lifting of restrictions could take place on a phased basis, with hospitality opening hours extended from next week, and capacity for cultural and sporting events expanded from the beginning of February.There is a growing push in Government to bring forward reopening plans from early February to next week if conditions continue to improve. Recent days have seen daily case numbers collapse and the situation in hospitals remains manageable, though busy. Both Mr Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar have made optimistic noises about reopening in recent days.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said he hopes for the quickest return to normal life possible, and that he thinks some measures will be lifted before the end of the monthEmergency powersSpeaking to RTÉ’s News at One programme, Mr Donnelly also said it is his hope that emergency powers relating to Covid-19 will not be renewed when the legislation enabling them lapses at the end of March. “My view is we introduced emergency powers to deal with this, we introduced very difficult measures to deal with this, and they were necessary and are necessary where the public health rationale to keep people safe is there. “What I want to see and what we all want to see is the quickest possible return to normal life and the lifting of all the restrictions where possible, but critically in a safe and balanced way so we don’t squander the very hard fought gains the country now has.”While Mr Donnelly wouldn’t be drawn on what specific measures may lapse first, and said that steps would be taken informed by public health advice, he nonetheless believed restrictions could be relaxed before the end of the month. “What people need is certainty and that’s what we’ll have in the coming days,” and that it was a question of what was the “best and safest way” to do so. Mr Donnelly said the intention was to invest and plan for the future of the pandemic, even as restrictions are loosened. “At the same time, what we’re doing is the medium term work to make sure we have the national defences in place to make sure that if another variant of concern arrives we can respond quickly.”Digital Covid CertElsewhere, Minister of State Ossian Smyth has said his hope is that the obligation to produce a Covid-19 cert domestically will expire at the end of March. While he says they will be needed for international travel, “domestically there’s no long term plan to keep them forever. They’re part of the restrictions that are due to expire on 31 March,” he said.“I don’t want them to go beyond that.”Expressing the view that there were non-financial costs to public health restrictions, borne of keeping people apart and regulating social contact, Mr Smyth said: “Putting in restrictions and keeping restrictions is not just something we can keep doing, it’s building up and I think there’s a limit to how much people can take.There were 979 Covid-19 patients in hospital on Tuesday morning, down from 1,006 the previous day.However, ICU numbers had increased on Monday to 97, the highest level since December 23rd last.The positivity rate dropped to 45.2 per cent on Monday, down from highs of more than 50 per cent a week ago, although changes to testing rules in the interim make direct comparisons difficult.On Monday, an additional 9,970 booster vaccines against Covid-19 were administered, giving a total of 2,472,236 booster doses.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said the booster vaccination programme had given a “window of opportunity” against the Omicron variant of the virus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ashling murphy remembered as woman who lived her short years to the full and made a difference","story":"Ashling Murphy was remembered as a kind, talented, loved and admired young woman at her funeral Mass in Mountbolus, Co Offaly.Ashling Murphy’s first-class pupils from Durrow National School hold a photo of their teacher outside the Church of St Brigid, Mountbolus, Co Offaly.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillSchool children holding laminated photographs of their beloved Miss Murphy on her graduation day along with a single red rose stood patiently at the gates of St Brigid’s Church in Mountbolus awaiting the funeral cortege of the popular teacher on Tuesday morning.Nearby were students from the Sacred Heart School in Tullamore. Co Offaly where Ashling Murphywas a student from 2011 to 2017. And everywhere there were musicians, inside the church, outside the church, before and after the funeral mass and later at Lowertown cemetery where Ashling was laid to rest.From early morning crowds had been gathering quietly and respectfully outside the small church. Gardaí and volunteers from Kilcormac-Killoughey GAA club directed traffic into parking spaces on each of the three routes into the village.Arriving before the funeral, President Michael D Higgins and his wife Sabina and Taoiseach Micheál Martin were met at the church door door by a number of clergy including the Bishop of Meath Tom Deenihan.Also in attendance were Minister for Justice Helen McEntee, Minister for Education Norma Foley and local TDs Sean Fleming and Brian Stanley.The funeral mass was live streamed to the local community centre and onto a large screen at the GAA pitch where a shrine to Ashling was bedecked in flowers, cards and photographs.Despite rain showers people remained in place for the service which featured numerous musical tributes along with readings and prayers by extended family members including her godparents Ger Leonard and Regina Murphy who brought to the altar the items representing her life - a hurley, a GAA jersey, a family photo and a schoolbook.End to violencePerhaps the most poignant was a prayer of the faithful by Ashling’s cousin Rachel O’Shea: “We pray that the many vigils that took place in memory of Ashling, mark the beginning of an end to violence against women. May the candle light tributes bring an everlasting hope to all those who live in fear.”Another prayer mentioned the Garda, specifically two members of the force who were the family’s liaison officers.Further prayers of the faithful were said for Ashling’s friends, colleagues and students in Ballyboy Comhaltas, Kilcormac-Killoughey Camogie club and Scoil Naomh Colmcille, Durrow, the family’s neighbours and friends, for the emergency services and all the staff at Tullamore hospital.They were read by Ashling’s cousins Siobhain Maher and Alisha Leonard, Ciara Leonard and Aoife Leonard, Rachel O’Shea and Caoimhe Dooley.In an address to the congregation before the final prayers of commendation, Bishop Deenihan said that Ashling Murphy’s death had been “a depraved act of violence which deprived a kind, talented, loved and admired young woman of her life, but that it had since united the country in grief and support.”Her murder also asked questions of society as a group and as iniduals.“It has questioned our attitudes and, particularly, our attitudes towards women and it has questioned our values and our morality. Whether those questions will be addressed or passed over remains to be seen, but we cannot allow such violence and disregard for both human life and bodily integrity take root in our time and culture,” he said.Precious gift“The past few days have been a nightmare. A walk on a mild and sunny afternoon in January should be a happy event, promising the brighter and warmer days of spring and summer. That, as we know, was not the case.“We all know that no inidual should die like Ashling and no family should suffer like Ashling’s. Respect is an old-fashioned word, but it is an important one. Respect was missing last Wednesday but it has re-emerged here all the stronger. Let us respect each other.“We bury a woman who lived the short years given to her to the full, who developed her talents, who reached out to others, who made a difference, who brought happiness and who was loved.”Local parish priest Fr Michael Meade gave the homily in which he said the grief of the community was the heavy price of love.“Kathleen and Ray, Cathal, Amy and Ashling’s boyfriend, Ryan - you have been robbed of your most precious gift - a gift that gave only joy and love, fun and laughter to many beyond your family.“That same love and joy was not kept on a shelf or wrapped up - it was freely given and shared through music, through sport, through her vocation as a teacher. Today we give thanks for the privilege of sharing in this most wonderful gift of Ashling Murphy, today we share our love, our grief, our faith and our comfort with the Murphy and Leonard families.”Following the funeral mass hundreds of mourners made the short walk to Lowertown cemetery where Ashling was laid to rest. Her boyfriend Ryan Casey made an emotional graveside speech in which he said Ashling had been so much more than a girlfriend to him and would always be his soulmate and “the greatest love of my life”.Afterwards, the many musicians present paid tribute to their departed friend with a selection of traditional tunes, as had been requested by her family.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"coveney to be asked to appear before committee over champagne party","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will be asked to appear before an Oireachtas committee to answer questions about the impromptu champagne celebration held by staff in June 2020. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will be asked to appear before an Oireachtas committee to answer questions about the impromptu champagne celebration held by 20 members of department staff in June 2020.The Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs met on Tuesday afternoon to make a decision on how the committee plans to examine the gathering.Sources say it was agreed that Mr Coveney will be asked to appear while members also want to see the terms of reference of an internal investigation ordered by Mr Coveney.It emerged on Sunday night that Mr Coveney last week asked the general secretary of the department, Joe Hackett, to examine the circumstances. A tweet of a photo posted by then secretary general Neil Burgess – now the Irish Ambassador to France – shortly after Ireland won a seat on the UN Security Council showed people celebrating with champagne in Iveagh House.It is likely that Mr Coveney will appear after the internal investigation is complete.It is understood concerns were expressed during Tuesday’s meeting about Mr Hackett carrying out the investigation and that committee members believe the investigation should be independent of the department.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin has said Simon Coveney should come before the Foreign Affairs committee over the champagne party in Iveagh House, and raised the possibility that senior civil servants may also be invited to account for the event.Significant issuesSpeaking before a meeting of the committee today, Sinn Féin’s spokeswoman on defence, Sorca Clarke TD, told reporters that there were significant issues to be addressed over the gathering, which occurred after Ireland won a seat on the UN security council in June 2020.“The Minister absolutely has questions to answer about this gathering and this event, the lead up to it, the night in question, and what transpired afterwards,” Ms Clarke said.“It is clear from the quotes that he has put out, and the statements he has put into the press, that he was aware of this event from very early on.“There are also questions in the run-up to this that needs to be answered, and ultimately the minister is responsible for the actions of his department and the committee is responsible and it’s part of our remit to scrutinise the minister.“At this stage we’re looking for a clear explanation of what happened, in leading up to that night, the night itself, and then afterwards,” she said, adding: “Who else was aware that this event had taken place, why hasn’t it come to the fore before now, while other events did and had gained so much traction”.Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile, who is also on the committee, said that there is “nothing to say we won’t explore this further”, when asked about whether senior civil servants may be asked to the committee – although in the first instance, the focus is on Mr Coveney.Asked about members of staff at Iveagh House who were at the event and who have since moved on to ambassadorial roles, hence with diplomatic immunity, Ms Clarke said: “That’s a question for themselves, the committee door is always open to them”.Mr Ó Donnghaile argued that the move to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs in was not political. “It’s a very legitimate ask that the Minister would come in front of us, particularly in the context of Covid and the restrictions and what so many people were asked to undertake,” he said.“The Minister is the line manager. He’s in charge, it’s his Department.“I don’t think it’s particularly political that a scrutiny committee would ask a Minister to answer questions when something like this has happened.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"anxiety voted childrens word year","story":"Anxiety has been voted the children\u0027s word of the year, highlighting impact of lockdown and school closures, say the Oxford University Press.More than 8,000 pupils aged between seven and 14 were asked to select from a shortlist of words they would use when talking about health and wellbeing in 2021 and their experiences of lockdown.The shortlist had been drawn up from the Oxford’s Children Corpus, an online database of material from stories and poems written by children as well as books written by children’s authors.Lexicographers and researchers analysed which words had most frequently appeared in the past year as well as the prominence they were given in each work.The team then selected the following ten words to be sent to schools across the UK: anxiety, challenging, isolate, wellbeing, resilience, bubble, kindness, remote, cancelled, empathy.After discussing the words with their teachers, pupils in each classroom agreed on the word most applicable to them.The research suggests that more than one in five (21 per cent) of surveyed pupils chose anxiety as their number one word. This was closely followed by challenging (19 per cent) and isolate (14 per cent).Researchers say the findings highlight the impact that lockdown and school closures had on children.For more than a decade, lexicographers, experts and academic researchers in the Children\u0027s Language department at the OUP have analysed the changes in children\u0027s vocabulary and self-expression.When the initiative was first launched in 2014 the word picked by children was Minions, in reference to the small yellow creatures popularised by the animated film of the same name.One year later the word was hashtag.However, the words for each successive year have since grown gloomier and more sombre in tone, with refugee in 2016, Trump in 2017, plastic in 2018, Brexit in 2019 and coronavirus in 2020.The department will be updating their dictionaries and resources for schools to reflect the current usage of the words - such as bubble and lockdown - in relation to the pandemic. New phrases such as self-isolation will be included.Helen Freeman, the director of early childhood and home education at OUP, said: The research highlights the vital role language plays for children when it comes to self-expression, learning and wellbeing.It\u0027s important now, more than ever, that we invest in supporting children\u0027s language development at home and in school.The findings demonstrate the role we all play in making sure children have the words they need to be able to express themselves and that, as adults, we are aware the language we use around children can significantly influence their learning and wellbeing.Wellbeing was selected as the focus of the vocabulary research for 2021.This was prompted by the impact Covid-19 has had on children\u0027s education and the growing awareness of children\u0027s mental health as a key concern.Joe Jenkins, the executive director, social impact from The Children\u0027s Society, said: It\u0027s concerning that \u0027anxiety\u0027 is the number one word but it isn\u0027t surprising when you consider all the restrictions and changes children had to endure.The charity\u0027s Good Childhood Report, which was published in August last year, found that more than 300,000 UK children were estimated to be unhappy with their lives in 2018-19.Mr Jenkins added: Having conversations and using the right language is incredibly important when supporting children if they are feeling anxious, isolated or going through tough challenges, and it\u0027s also crucial children are able to express how they are feeling.Teachers from the 85 schools involved in the survey were also asked for the word they use most often when talking to their pupils about health and wellbeing in the context of the past year.Resilience came in as their top choice (31 per cent), which researchers said reflected the importance of providing their pupils with positive direction.Challenging was their second choice (19 per cent) and wellbeing came in third (18 per cent).More from NewsUniversities urged to support pledge and end use of NDAs to silence sexual harassment victimsGovernment wins appeal over ‘unlawful’ Covid contract awarded to friends of Dominic CummingsScotland to lift most remaining restrictions from Monday, Nicola Sturgeon confirms‘If it stops, we will march on Delhi’: India’s surrogacy capital greets potential ban with with furyTuesday evening UK news briefing: Rishi Sunak speaks out on Boris Johnson over Downing Street partiesReckless Germany is making war in Ukraine more likelyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc has acting like fox news left","story":"One may feel slightly cynical about Nadine Dorries’s timing of her announcement about the future of the BBC licence fee. The freeze for two years was already known. Her talk of a new funding model by 2028 is vaguer than her rhetoric implies. She is choosing this moment because of the BBC’s coverage of the revelations about Downing Street parties during Covid. This is more politics than policy.The problem is that the BBC has made it easy for her. I actually do believe that Tim Davie, the director-general, is serious about impartiality, but the corporation’s implementation of his Action Plan is slow in that special way that only great bureaucracies can manage.The story about Boris and parties is a classic case where the national broadcaster needs to show super-impartiality but the coverage has showed no recognition whatever of what Mr Davie seeks.On the contrary, from the news that starts the day to Newsnight, with presenters like Lewis Goodall, which ends it, the BBC has tried to prove that this is the worst scandal in living memory and will be fatal to Boris Johnson’s premiership. It has dragged out the sort of disgruntled Tory backbenchers it normally despises and given them endless airtime to attack the Prime Minister. It is not far off being a Fox News of the Left, taking a line and incessantly promoting it.Newspapers, too, have made a great meal of the scandal, and a good read it has often been. But this is exactly the sort of occasion where a compulsorily funded broadcaster should not try to ape Fleet Street. If you had relied solely on BBC coverage last week, you would have concluded that Boris was about to be kicked out. There was almost no presentation of the contrary view – which precedent suggests is likelier to be right – that he probably wasn’t.As a result, the BBC under-served its audiences, who crave news that is calm, balanced and correctly prioritised. The biggest story in the world last week (and this) is the possibility of Russia invading Ukraine. The BBC virtually forgot this.The news that a Chinese agent had donated nearly half a million pounds to the office of the Labour MP Barry Gardiner was also strong – a much more significant example of apparent political corruption than the standard “Tory sleaze” tales which the BBC relishes, yet it was downplayed.Some BBC presenters, including Dan Walker, tweeted against Ms Dorries’s plans. Every time they behave like this, they help her, and hinder Mr Davie.When the phrase “fuel poverty” first entered public debate a few years ago, I criticised it as a cant concept invented by subsidy pressure groups. Why single out fuel? If you are poor, you find it hard to pay for all essentials. The poor needed help in the round, I argued, not through price controls and special government interventions.Nowadays, however, the phrase “fuel poverty” is wholly justified. The stupefying energy price rises coming our way are caused only in part by the surge in global energy demand after Covid. These intense market pressures will right themselves over time. The grave added problem is the decisions by governments of both parties to rig the energy market for other ends.Because these governments have decided there is a climate “emergency” and that net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 is the remedy, they have deliberately forced up household energy bills by adding green levies to them. For the same reason, they have taken measures to reduce British production of the fossil fuels – particularly gas – which our country can plentifully supply and will need for years to cover for the “intermittency” of wind and solar energy.Theresa May’s energy price cap was a clumsy statist measure to mitigate this self-created problem. It does nothing to solve it, and it has already driven many small energy suppliers out of business.So yes, we are indeed fuel-poor, and getting poorer. And therefore, many are cold, and will get colder.A similar approach increasingly governs this Government’s attitude to food production. How long before we find ourselves facing policy-induced “food poverty”? I have just invented the phrase, but there is already a word for the consequence – hunger.Here is this column’s final word about the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s connection with Surrey. Having served there as a curate, benefitting from the kindness of the Lambert family in Bletchingly (see this Notebook two weeks ago), he returned many years later in archiepiscopal splendour to marry Uvedale Lambert’s grand-daughter, the jeweller Cassandra Goad, in the family chapel.“The Archbishop then proclaimed, to cheers and laughter, ‘I think we can safely assume that the Good Lord has decided to bless this particular union today’ before handing it back to the groom for a second go.” Many years later, the couple are still married, so he would appear to have been right.More from NewsUniversities urged to support pledge and end use of NDAs to silence sexual harassment victimsGovernment wins appeal over ‘unlawful’ Covid contract awarded to friends of Dominic CummingsScotland to lift most remaining restrictions from Monday, Nicola Sturgeon confirms‘If it stops, we will march on Delhi’: India’s surrogacy capital greets potential ban with with furyTuesday evening UK news briefing: Rishi Sunak speaks out on Boris Johnson over Downing Street partiesReckless Germany is making war in Ukraine more likelyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeons scotland becoming everything swore against","story":"According to her boss, Lorna Slater is “an incredibly hard worker”. Let’s just pause a moment to consider this endorsement.Slater is one of two Scottish ministers drawn from the ranks of the Green Party. Her boss is the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who appointed her in the first place and therefore has a vested interest in Slater’s success in the role.But the minister has been criticised for supposedly telling her civil servants that even during the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, she wanted no more than two ministerial appointments a day in her diary, that she didn’t want to start work too early, had plenty of time to eat and an adequate number of days off.This is, to say the least, would be a list of unusual demands, particularly since COP26 represented everything that brought every Green Party member into politics in the first place. If a Green minister prioritises her down time even as world leaders meet to negotiate an end to climate change, you have to wonder what circumstances might persuade her to forgo a long lie. After preferred gender pronouns, the environment is the Greens’ top priority, but what kind of priority allows a Green minister to get to the pub on the first night of the summit by 17:30?All of Slater’s alleged demands seem perfectly sensible for your average worker on average wages — a description which does not, unfortunately, include Slater or any of her ministerial colleagues.I never worked harder than I did during my relatively short ministerial career: early mornings, back-to-back meetings and speeches, briefing sessions — all day, every day. And it was wonderful. It was a privilege. It was the best job I ever had and I was incredibly lucky to have it.Perhaps, even as co-leader of her party, Slater was unaware of the pressures of a life in politics, particularly the unusual and extraordinary pressures that being a minister entails. She was a Green, after all — what reason had she to speculate about the workload of a minister?Let’s return to the first minister’s inevitable defence of Slater’s performance. Just to be mischievous, let us take her at her word and assume that Slater is, as Sturgeon said, “an incredibly hard worker”. 1. impossible to believe. an almost incredible tale of triumph and tragedy2. difficult to believe extraordinary. the noise from the crowd was incredibleSo, that’s a useful context, and accurate if “impossible or difficult to believe” is what the first minister intended. Perhaps she meant that compared with other colleagues and their workloads, Slater’s own ministerial tartan box is heavier and more substantial, taking up even more time than anyone else’s.This also has the ring of truth to it. After all, the civil service can only generate so much work for 27 ministers. In pre-devolution days, the old Scottish Office managed to get by with one Secretary of State and four ministers under him, dealing with health, education, transport, the economy and justice, plus anything else that came their way. An increase was obviously necessary after devolution. But 27? Really?Of course, Slater’s supporters — which includes a smattering of Scottish Labour MSPs from the Corbynite wing of the party — will cite the need for ministers’ roles to be modernised, for their leisure time to be respected, for their family life and mental health not to be compromised by the demands of helping to run a government department.In fact the Scottish Parliament itself was set up specifically to reform and reject anything that smacked of the “old politics”— i.e. anything that Westminster did.So no more late night votes, no more early starts, no more working in parliament on Mondays or Fridays (these would be designated “constituency days”). Procedures too were changed, not necessarily for the better, but to make them different from Westminster, which at Holyrood amounted to the same thing. So MSPs could refer to each other by name instead of constituency, the Speaker was referred to as “presiding officer” and instead of having a confrontational “us and them” style chamber separated by two sword lengths, the parliament was made semi-circular in shape, all the easier for its denizens, when the mood took them, to clasp hands and hum Kumbaya my Lord together.Slater and her new job are part of that 21st century makeover. Working all the hours that God sends for the good of your country is just so…well, Westminster. Ministerial work now must fit into a minister’s social life. Now that really is incredible.More from NewsUniversities urged to support pledge and end use of NDAs to silence sexual harassment

a pair of PhD students like slaves by asking them to do her gardening, redecorate her home and go underwear shopping has won a £15,000 payout after a tribunal ruled she was wrongly sacked.Prof Shuang Cang from Northumbria University was investigated by police for modern day slavery offences after two postgraduate students alleged they were “just servants to her”.The PhD students, from China, claimed Prof Cang forced them to cut down trees in her garden, move heavy furniture, dispose of her rubbish and pay for meals, an employment tribunal heard.Chinese-born Prof Cang, 59, who has worked in the UK for 30 years, was also accused of demanding the pair be available to her 12 hours a day to run errands.The students, both in their 30s, said they feared they would not be awarded their doctorates if they did not comply with the academic\u0027s demands.One of the students said it was Chinese culture to “do what teachers say”.During the lengthy police investigation, Prof Cang denied the allegations or insisted they were exaggerated in what she claimed was a “collaborated attack” against her.Although detectives dropped their slavery investigation into her, the “excellent” and “impressive” professor was sacked by the university for gross misconduct.Now, the tribunal has ruled that Prof Cang was wrongfully dismissed with a judge saying the panel couldn’t be sure the accusations were true.The tribunal, in Newcastle, heard that Prof Cang joined the university’s faculty of business and law on a salary of £63,000 from Bournemouth University in February 2018.Her Chinese PhD students both claim they were “coerced ” to relocate from Bournemouth, with the threat of them failing their PhD.One student, named only as “ZW”, was a 34-year-old man from Shanghai, while the other, “DC”, was a married woman in her 30s.Allegations listed in a tribunal report included: “Oppression and exploitation of students by forcing them to carry out physical work in her house such as furniture moving, garbage disposal, garden clearance, cleaning and painting rooms.”But Prof Cang, who was “visibly shocked” when she was arrested, said the allegations were unfounded and that she enjoyed good relationships with the pair and considered them “like her own children”.She said the only chores she could remember them doing was the washing up and half an hour’s worth of ironing.The tribunal also heard there were “serious concerns” that ZW had committed plagiarism and he cannot now be found, while DC may have had a “motive to lie or exaggerate” to obtain an extension of time granted to study in the UK.Tudor Garnon, the employment judge, said he could not be sure the allegations were true and criticised university academics Prof John Wilson, for his investigation, and Prof John Woodward for the disciplinary hearing he chaired.Judge Garnon said: “There are huge gaps in the questioning of the students and areas of their evidence which needed to be investigated further to look for real corroboration or the lack of it.“Based on what we know now and with the obvious gaps in the questioning of ZW and DC, we are not satisfied the university has shown the serious allegations of Prof Cang taking advantage of them to be more likely than not to have happened.Prof Cang won £14,884 for wrongful dismissal, £2,234 for untaken annual leave, and £30.34 for unpaid expenses.She lost claims of discrimination and harassment based on race and must pay a £1,000 deposit to the university.More from NewsChinese Communist Party can access athletes\u0026#39 personal data

thirds covid vaccine side effects imagined study suggests","story":"Two thirds of side effects associated with the Covid-19 vaccine are likely to be caused by the nocebo effect - where people become ill because they expect to, scientists believe.US researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre (BIDMC) in Boston, studied the rates of adverse events reported by 22,000 vaccine trial participants who received a real jab, compared with a similar number who received a dummy injection.After one dose, more than 35 per cent of placebo participants experienced symptoms such as headaches, fever and swelling at the injection site, compared with 46 per cent of the vaccine group.After a second dose, 32 per cent given a placebo reported side effects compared with 61 per cent who had a real jab.Analysis suggested that the nocebo effect accounted for 76 per cent of side effects after a first dose, and 52 per cent after a second, meaning that overall, around two thirds of symptoms were imagined.Experts said that people should be warned they could experience nocebo symptoms in order to lessen fears.“Nonspecific symptoms like headache and fatigue are listed among the most common adverse reactions following Covid-19 vaccination in many information leaflets,” said senior author Ted Kaptchuk, director of the Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter at BIDMC and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.  “Evidence suggests that this sort of information may cause people to misattribute common daily background sensations as arising from the vaccine or cause anxiety and worry that make people hyper alert to bodily feelings about adverse events.“Medicine is based on trust. Our findings lead us to suggest that informing the public about the potential for nocebo responses could help reduce worries about Covid-19 vaccination, which might decrease vaccination hesitancy.”The placebo effect is the phenomenon where a person’s physical or mental health improves after they receive a treatment with no pharmacological therapeutic benefit, such as a sugar pill or a syringe full of saline.But sometimes placebo effects can also harm - the so-called nocebo effect occurs when a person experiences unpleasant side effects after a dummy treatment.“Adverse events after placebo treatment are common in randomised controlled trials,” said lead author Dr Julia Haas, an investigator in the Program in Placebo Studies at BIDMC.“Collecting systematic evidence regarding these nocebo responses in vaccine trials is important for Covid-19 vaccination worldwide, especially because concern about side effects is reported to be a reason for vaccine hesitancy.”  The research was published in the journal Jama Network Open.More from NewsUniversities urged to support pledge and end use of NDAs to silence sexual harassment victimsGovernment wins appeal over ‘unlawful’ Covid contract awarded to friends of Dominic CummingsScotland to lift most remaining restrictions from Monday, Nicola Sturgeon confirms‘If it stops, we will march on Delhi’: India’s surrogacy capital greets potential ban with with furyTuesday evening UK news briefing: Rishi Sunak speaks out on Boris Johnson over Downing Street partiesReckless Germany is making war in Ukraine more likelyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rule changes could happen","story":"All Covid rule changes that could happen next week as Plan B substantially reducedHealth Secretary Sajid Javid has said Englands Covid Plan B rules are likely to be substantially reduced after Omicron cases began falling again - from work-from-home to Covid passes and masks, heres whats on the tableA Covid Pass is displayed via the NHS app, inside the Riverside Stadium in MiddlesbroughByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | commentsBoris Johnson is poised to drop a raft of England’s Plan B rules next week after MPs were told they can be “substantially reduced”. Work-from-home guidance and Covid passes for nightclubs are expected to go on January , though reports suggest face mask rules on shops and public transport will stay. Face masks in school, travel tests on arrival to the UK and daily contact tests could all also be eased.Health Secretary Sajid Javid today said he is cautiously optimistic that the Government can substantially reduce Covid restrictions next week - while No hinted an announcement is due within days. He told MPs it’s likely we have already reached the peak of the case numbers of hospitalisations as ministers prepare to review Plan B measures next Wednesday. Mr Javid is the third minister in a week to sound hopeful about lting Plan B measures.  New positive Covid cases have fallen % in a week with , recorded yesterday, and hospital admissions have plateaued. But deaths are still up % in a week to , and , people were admitted to hospital with Covid yesterday alone.Sajid Javid told the Commons: The action that this Government has taken in response to Omicron and the collective efforts of the British people have seen us become the most boosted country in Europe, the most tested country in Europe, andthe most antivirals per head in Europe.That is why we are the most open country in Europe. I have always said that these restrictions should not stay in place a day longer than absolutely necessary. Due to these pharmaceutical defences and the likelihood that we have already reached the peak of the case numbers of hospitalisations, I am cautiously optimistic that we will be able to substantially reduce restrictions next week. Here are all the changes that could happen, or have happened already: Working from home guidance Since December  people have been urged to “work from homeyou can” in England. This guidance, which is not legally binding, is a key way of getting cases down - but the government says it has “immediate costs to the economy”. Tory ministers have repeatedly emphasised how much worth they place on going into offices in person. As such, it is a key measure the Prime Minister will want to get rid of when England’s Plan B rules are reviewed.  Covid vaccine passes at nightclubs and big sports Since December , nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches in England have had to ask punters for proof of either a vaccine, or negative lateral flow test. But the law that enforces Covid ‘passports’ expires at .pm on Wednesday  January. Boris Johnson would likely need to put any extension to a vote - and last time around  Tory MPs rebelled.The Prime Minister is already battling for survival over Downing Street parties, and another huge revolt could be fatal. Mr Johnson had suggested the definition of ‘vaccinated’ for a Covid pass would be updated from two to three doses. This has already happened in Scotland as of January  - but it will not necessarily be the same in England. Officials are still waiting for many people who caught Covid in December to get a booster, as being infected triggers a -day ban on getting jabbed. But face masks in shops and on trains might stay Face masks were made compulsory in England in two waves through winter, first on public transport, then in shops. They are also mandatory in shopping malls, taxis, banks, post offices, hair salons, barbers, nail salons, pharmacies, vets, auction houses, takeaways , estate agents. But these face mask laws came before Plan B, and reports have suggested they could outlast it too. Sunday newspapers have claimed some face mask restrictions could be extended beyond January .  Masks in schools axed Englandaposs secondary schools have told students to wear face masks in the classroom since January . But reports suggest this rule will be axed around the time Plan B is eased on January  - or even before that date, as it’s not formally part of Plan B. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday: “I don’t want to see masks in the classroom for a day longer than is necessary. “And on January  we’ll review that and I hope we’ll be able to take it away.” Travel testing axed for the vaccinated Vaccinated travellers will soon be allowed toto the UK without taking a Covid test at all,a change gets the go-ahead. Currently vaccinated travellers must take a lateral flow test within two days of ing to Britain. Anyone who tests positive must isolate for ten days, although this can be cut short with a negative lateral flow test on days six and seven.But it’s understood Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is looking at removing this last UK test requirement for vaccinated travellers by the end of January.If so, it is likely to coincide with the review of the plan B measures on January . Unjabbed travellers would still need to take UK arrival tests - and of course, British tourists may still have to take tests when heading abroad, depending on which country they go to. Daily testing for Covid contacts cut The self-isolation period for people with Covid was shortened this weekto at least five full days in England. Butyou’re a contact of someone with Covid, the rules haven’t changed yet - you don’t need to isolate, but you do need to take a daily lateral flow test for seven days. When isolation changes were announced last week, the government said it would review this guidance - hinting it could be cut to five days too.The government said it would “consider the guidance for close contacts of people with COVID-, including around the advice for fully vaccinated contacts to take daily LFDs for  days.”So far no change has been announced. … And the changes already confirmed Covid isolation cut to five full days in England The Covid isolation period in England has been cut to five full days since January .Previously people who tested positive for Covid could be freed midway through their seventh full day of isolation,they test negative on days six and seven. That period has been cut by between  and  hours, after huge pressure from Tory MPs and a staffing crisis in the NHS.Under the new rules, people in England with Covid must isolate for at least five full days. They will then be able to leave isolation at the start of the sixth full day -they have tested negative for Covid on both Day  and Day .Your first full day of isolation starts at .am, the calendar day after you test positive or show symptoms. Soyou test positive at am, aposDay apos starts  hours later.This means the new total isolation time is, in reality, somewhere between five and six days depending on what time you went into isolation. UK Health Security Agency data shows around two thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by the end of Day . This rises to %people have two negative lateral flow tests,  hours apart. In Scotland and Wales, the isolation period is still seven days . Booster vaccines for - and -year-olds All eligible - and -year-olds are able to book a Covid booster jab from January .Previously, boosters were only recommended for clinically vulnerable  and -year-olds who are most at risk from Covid-. But recent data from the UKHSA showed two doses were not enough to stop people becoming unwell from Omicron.More than , in the age group in England have had their second jab, so will be eligible for a booster. However, not all are eligible now, as they still have to wait until three months since their second dose. About , teenagers are newly eligible now, and many of the rest should become eligible in the coming weeks. Omicron restrictions relaxed in Scotland Scotlandaposs limit on football matches and other outdoor events has been scrapped from January .Football matches and other outdoor events in Scotland were limited to only  people from December , meaning Boxing Day games were effectively fan free and Hogmanay festivities were axed.That -person limit has now been axed - followed by all other Omicron restrictions in Scotland from next week. Omicron restrictions relaxed in Wales Covid restrictions in Wales are being eased over the next two weeks, the Welsh Government has confirmed. Since Saturday, as many as  people have been able to attend outdoor event activities - rising from . And from this Friday  January there will be no limits on the number of people who can take part in outdoor activities. Nightclubs could reopen from January , which is when alert level  restrictions will come in to force for indoor restrictions.

The deputy Prime Minister, who is in charge of the justice system, referred to a May  gathering as a “party” in a nightmare interview with Sky News - before hurriedly backtracking. In an echo of his claim the sea was closed when he spent the fall of Kabul on holiday, he also complained claims the bash was thrown in his honour were “nonsense” because “I wasn’t invited”. Twitter users compared the Cabinet minister to Private Pike from Dad’s Army while shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: “Itaposs like an episode of Columbo, ‘thereaposs just one more thing, Mr Raab…’.” It came as two serving ministers broke cover to offer criticism of the PM’s No operation - after six backbench MPs called for him to resign. Science minister George Freeman said people in positions of power shouldnapost seek to escape public responsibility or accountability, adding: The prime minister and his office should set the highest standards. Health minister Maria Caulfield said that whether or not rules were technically breached, the spirit of the rules was broken. Mr Raab was dispatched to defend his boss after ex-aide Dominic Cummings said Boris Johnson lied to Parliament about a BYOB gathering on  May .The Prime Minister told MPs he “believed implicitly” it was a work event. But Mr Cummings said principle private secretaryMartin Reynolds agreed to speak to Mr Johnson ahead of the event when another official said on e-mail that it broke the rules.Mr Cummings also said he personally raised the “drinks party” withBoris Johnsonand called No a “madhouse” but the Prime Minister waved it aside.Askedthe Prime Minister should resignhe lied to Parliament, Mr Raab told Sky News’ Kay Burley: “I’m not going to speculate on hypothetical situations.” Askedhe was aware of a drinking culture, the Justice Secretary replied: “No.” But he added: “People were working extremely long hours, so it doesn’t surprise mepeople, as you see in other walks of le, had a glass of wine or beer at the end of a very long week.”  Mr Raab then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”Speaking to Times Radio, the deputy PM defended Boris Johnson saying: Look, the suggestion that heaposs lied is nonsense.Heaposs made it very clear to the House of Commons, took questions on this, that he thought it was a work event.“Of course, Sue Gray is looking into all of this, so Iaposm not going to start commenting on every little snippet that is further trailed in. “Thataposs precisely why we have a proper investigation. And thereaposll be full transparency when it reports.” Mr Raab accepted “double standards” are “toxic” and he was well aware of public anger about the Downing Street bashes. But he claimed: “I think there is something of a caricature that is being depicted against the incredibly professional, dedicated, hard work that I saw.” Mr Cummings claims he toldBoris Johnson“you’ve got to grip this madhouse” after the invite was sent out asking around  staff to attend the BYOB party at No.He says at least two senior officials told Boris Johnson’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to cancel the garden party on May , . Mr Reynolds then allegedly checked with the PM whether the event could go ahead, and was told that it could. Mr Cummings, a bitter foe of the PM since his departure from No in November , also claimed he had challenged Mr Johnson himself. If true, this means the PM lied to the house in his apology last week. The Ministerial Code says: Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson attended the party, it is understood with his we Carrie. He sparked widespread ­disbelief last week atPMQswhen he claimed he “implicitly believed” it was work related.In response to Mr Cummings’ claims, a No spokesman said last night: “It is untrue the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. As he said earlier this week, he believed implicitly that this was a work event. “He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.” But Mr Cummings’ allegations will increase the jitters of Tory MPs.  Senior Tory MP Steve Baker said his constituents were “about  to one against the PM” over the parties row. The MP said “rule-makers must obey the rules”, but he said he would wait for Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray’s report before taking any action. Several MPs told the Mirror they had received hundreds of emails from furious constituents about the PM’s apparent rule-breaking. Others said their local associations had urged them to put in a letter to kick off a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson. One Tory told the Mirror: “The PM is fatally damaged, way beyond repair. Activists are refusing to campaign at the local elections until he is gone.” Sue Gray, whose report is expected later this week, is ­understood to have interviewed Mr Johnson, and No sources claim he has “shared what he knows”.

The senior civil servant is said to believe that for her inquiry to be seen as credible she has to speak to all key witnesses. While it is not yet clear whether she has already been in touch with the PMaposs former closest aide, she plans to be before publishing her findings into Downing Street gatherings. One source said: Sue wants the inquiry to be as robust as possible. Cummings is going to be interviewed by the time the inquiry concludes. It would be extraordinarywe went through the whole thing and no attempt was made to interview him.In explosive claims, Mr Cummings had said that the PM had waved aside concerns about the rule-busting gathering which then went ahead.  He claimed that he and other eyewitnesses would be willing to swear under oath that senior officials had warned the event was against the rules.Mr Johnson sparked widespread disbelief last week at PMQs when he apologised for the gathering but claimed he implicitly believed it was work related.The under-fire PM broke cover for the first time in days on Tuesday to insist that he hadnapost lied to Parliament. In his clip to broadcasters, Mr Johnson confirmed that he had also been interviewed by Ms Gray. I do humbly apologise to people for misjudgments that were made, he said. But that is the very, very best of my recollection about this event. Thataposs what Iaposve said to the inquiry.  Mr Johnson claimed that nobody told me that the boozy lockdown bash in the No  garden broke Covid rules. Downing Street has fiercely denied the claims, backed up by several senior journalists, that two officials told the PM the event was “a party” before it happened.Deputy PM Dominic Raab said on Tuesday that Mr Johnson would normally be expected to resignhe had intentionally misled Parliament.But he dismissed the claim by Mr Cummings, who has become the PMaposs fiercest critic, that the PM had lied to the Commons as nonsense. However, Mr Raab described the event as a party before rapidly backtracking. Many Tory MPs are believed to be waiting for the result of Ms Grayaposs inquiry, which could be pushed back until next week, before deciding whether to trigger a confidence vote in the PM. Exactly  letters need to be submitted, with reports suggesting that around half that number are already in.

The UK Health Security Agencyhas previously described the plans as counterproductive. How long do children need to self-isolate for   The rule changes mean that all people, including children, must isolate for five full days before ing to school. Previously, people in England who were fully vaccinated could end their isolation period after seven days, providing they tested negative via a lateral flow teston days six and seven. The government explained the guidance: All people – including pupils parents and teachers - have to isolate for a minimum of five full days after the day of a positive test before then going back to schoolthey have tested negative twice.  The day a person tests positive is considered aposday zeroapos. The first full day, aposday oneapos, is the day after their first positive test.

By putting up taxes, particularly National Insurance, and refusing to suspend VAT on energy bills, the Conservatives demonstrate with crystal clarity that they are not on the side of hard-working families and pensioners. As Money Saving Expert guru Martin Lewis points out, there is another way. The Conservatives are simply guilty of making bad, wrong choices. Slashing the spending power of households is doubly cruel after all that families are going through because of the Covid pandemic. Our economy is considerably weaker than the partying Prime Minister pretends. Reduced living standards will be one of many legacies of Conservative mismanagement their successors will have to deal with. Big dog’s done  If attempting to misuse the Royal Navy and dismantle the BBC are first glimpses of “Operation Save Big Dog” then the sooner Boris Johnson is put out of his misery, the better for Britain. The Prime Minister’s clumsy attempts to sht public attention from his law-breaking parties only emphasise what an untrustworthy, incompetent lightweight he is. Warships are for war, not for turning back desperate migrants in the Channel. And punishing the BBC for reporting his No boozy bashes is the revenge of a thin-skinned tyrant. Johnson demeans the great office of state to which he now clings. Princely deed  Family rts are painful in private – and excruciating in public.

The Chancellor said of course I do when askedhe accepted Mr Johnsonaposs explanation to MPs about his attendance at a boozy bash in the Downing Street garden in the first lockdown. But he warned that the ministerial code is clear on the rules for anyone who misleads Parliament - and then swtly departed a pool interview. An ally of the Chancellor said the interview had not been brief and he had answered more questions than the agreed three. Mr Sunak broke cover on Tuesday after keeping a low profile while rows raged over allegations of boozy bashes in Downing Street.  Mr Johnson admitted in Parliament last week that he briefly attended a BYOB gathering in the No  garden on May   - but tried to claim he thought it was a work event.Ex-aide Dominic Cummings claimed the Prime Minister had ‘lied to Parliament’ and multiple witnesses aposwould swear under oathapos that he did. In an explosive blogpost, Mr Cummings said the PM was warned that the event was against the rules but he waved it aside. Askedhe believed Johnsonaposs account to parliament, Mr Sunak told reporters: Of course I do - the Prime Minister set out his understanding of this matter in Parliament last week. But he refused to give Mr Johnson his full backing, with a warning that the ministerial code was clear on what should happenanyone lied to Parliament. Askedthe PM would have to resignit was proven he had lied to parliament, Mr Sunak said: Iaposm not going to get into hypotheticals. The ministerial code is clear on these matters. But as you know, Sue Grey is conducting an inquiry into the situation. I think itaposs right that we allow her to conclude that job.  He then abruptly left the interview, with an aide standing in front of the camera. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: Rishi Sunak is running scared once again. Instead of setting out a plan to tackle the Conservatives’ cost of living crisis - he dodges scrutiny and defends the bungling Prime Minister. “When the Vanishing Chancellor reappears, he has a choice. He can continue his inaction and clobber our communities with tax rises and surging energy bills. It comes as Mr Johnson was battling to save his premiership in a move supposedly dubbed Operation Save Big Dog by his allies. But his authority has been badly damaged by the slew of revelations about rule-breaking parties in Downing Street, with No  forced to apologise to the Queen last week for the news of two dos on the eve of Prince Phillipaposs funeral.Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said that ministers would be expected to resignthey intentionally misled Parliament but dismissed the idea the PM had done so.Mr Raab told Times Radio: The suggestion that he lied is nonsense. Heaposs made it very clear to the House of Commons that questions on this... that he thought it was a work event. Pressed on what would be expectedMr Johnson had lied to the Commons, he told Today: If itaposs lying, deliberate in the way you describe,itaposs not corrected immediately, it would normally under the ministerial code and the governance around Parliament be a resigning matter. Mr Raab also described the event in question as a party before rowing back on the remark.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided. History will be justiably unkind to a truly terrible leader.

Bev Rimes and Hayley Russell, both , first became pals when they worked together at the same nursery and bonded over their shared love of Take That. As they became closer, Hayley confided in mum-of-three Bev about her fertility struggles after the heartbreak of losing two babies.After finding out she was pregnant with hubby Jasonaposs baby in , Hayley tragically miscarried four weeks into her pregnancy.The following year she fell pregnant again, but lost the baby at  weeks. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Bev, who has two older kids Alfie, , and Archie, eight, with her hub Tim, said: We spoke about Hayleyaposs losses a lot and I remember telling her she would have a baby one day. It made us a lot closer and I wanted to support her as much as I could. Then, one afternoon in June  while having afternoon tea with her bestie, Hayley mentioned she felt too unwell to have a glass of champagne.Bev joked she could be pregnant - leading Hayley to pop out and buy a pregnancy test. Coincidentally, Bev started to feel a bit under the weather too.Each of the women took a test on the same day - and both had a positive result.  Over the moon at her wonderful news, Hayley caught her girlfriends up on the same group chat that Bev was in. When I saw her announcement, I was over the moon. I cried more seeing her pregnancy test than I did seeing my own. I was just amazed for her. I just couldnapost stop crying, it was so emotional. And when the pair discovered they both had a due date of  February, they were even more excited. After experiencing each stage of their pregnancy together, their tandem journey towards motherhood stepped up a gear when the pair both went into labour on the same night - a month before their due date. At am on  January , Bev and Hayley found themselves in adjoining hospital cubicles after each of their waters broke. Bev said: I remember hearing Hayleyaposs voice in the next cubicle at the hospital and I just couldnapost believe it. We had the same due date, then our waters broke four weeks early at the same time. Even the midwives said theyaposd not seen anything like this happen before! But the deliveries werenapost all smooth sailing and Hayley had a tense moment when her babyaposs heartbeat began to drop.  For Bev, the turmoil of knowing something was wrong with her best friend in the next cubicle was too much to bear. My best friend was next to me, I could hear the heartbeat and I couldnapost do anything to help her - it was horric, she recalled. Luckily, the moment passed and, after several years of heartbreak Hayleyaposs healthy baby boy Henry was born via c-section later that day weighing lbs oz. When I saw Hayley with this healthy baby, I was so grateful to have my baby, but to see her was just incredible, Bev said. It was one of the best moments in my le. It was a once in a million moment. You can never imagine anything like that happening. Bevaposs daughter Lilly arrived shortly before Henry, weighing lbs oz and the best friends were over the moon their little ones shared a birthday.The pairaposs friendship was strengthened even further when little Lilly battled sepsis at just three months old and Hayley supported Bev throughout.Since Lilly and Henry were born, the women have raised the pair like twins - with Lilly showing sassy and confident qualities like her mum, while Henry is the quieter of the two. Bev said: I think Lilly will be sticking up for Henry as they get older.Did you go through pregnancy with your best friend  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcUntil now, theyaposve not been able to enjoy joint birthday parties because of the pandemic, but this year Bev and Hayley organised a party with  friends and their kids at a soft play centre as the little ones turned four. Bev said: It was wonderful and weaposll be looking forward to the date each year for many years. Weaposll still be telling this story on their wedding days!

But while one woman in Russia adores her gorgeous kitten, he takes up a little more room than the average puss. Yulia Minina, who lives in the small town of Stary Oskol, bought gorgeous cat Kefir almost two years ago as a tiny kitten. The Maine Coon, who is named after the dairy drink because of his stunning silky white coat, is often mistaken for a dog because heaposs so enormous, Yulia claims. He weighs .kgand is likely to become even heavier - as Maine Coons tend to grow until theyaposre three of four years old. Yulia said: I could not even think that an ordinary baby can become so big.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here He not only grew up big in appearance, he is also very smart and always behaves calmly. The look is generally like that of a person, and Kefir has a formidable appearance, but he is a very affectionate and modest child. When friends and acquaintances come to the house - all the attention is on him and he willingly allows himself to be stroked. However, when strangers who have never seen Kefir before come to the house, theyaposre confused by the regal creature greeting them at the door. aposaposBut when strangers come to the house, everyone first confuses him with a dog, Yulia said. “He has one more habit: at night he likes to climb on me and sleep. When he was a kitten, it didn’t cause me any inconvenience. aposaposBut now he has become big and heavy, and, of course, it is dficult to sleep like that. At one year and  months old, it seems Kefir will be disturbing Yuliaaposs sleep for years to come. Photos of Yulia carrying her big baby show how enormous he is, almost dwarfing his owner with his huge frame and bottle brush tail. Some people arenapost sureKefir is truly as big as he seems in photos, but Yulia insists: I donapost use Photoshop.

Sayu Sinha, , and his we Sharon have transformed their home in Ealing, London in a aposback-to-brickapos renovation. The stunning conversion saw the house updated from s décor but ensured they reinstated the key period features. The pair moved from Notting Hill to accommodate their growing needs as a family, according to Sayu who is a commercial property investor. He said they wanted to find a detached house with a large garden and just a  minute commute.That was the equivalent of buying a £ million house in Cha, in St. Johnaposs Wood, in Little Venice, he told My London.  But in Ealing, it cost me probably about a third of that but it gives me the same commuting time. They bought the , square foot property in September  and started work in January  once planning permission had been obtained. The first lockdown presented challenges for the couple to tackle but after seven months, they moved in. Stripping the house back to its bricks gave them an opportunity to craft their perfect family home. Sayu said: It gave us a real blank canvas to make our own mark - we loved it. The idea was that when you walk in, you get all the beautul kind of classic period features that the Edwardian houses kind of afford you around here and as you progress through the house towards the rearwe kept that relatively modern and contemporary by introducing the cripple doors. Designed by Tom Harley, the classic kitchen is what Sayu calls the marriage point of the two styles and is his favourite part of the whole renovation. He said preservation of the character of the house was key. Covid forced the project into turmoil when the supply chain came to a grinding halt. Sayu and Sharon both tried to do some work on the site without the help of workers which he called: an absolute disaster. The pair decided that the situation would fix itself within months and so remained positive, We kind of took an optimistic lens out of a box and said that this problem will sort itself out in three, six, or nine months, whatever that timeframe might be, he said. But it gives us a great opportunity to kind of just plan for the tail end of the project: the floors, the lighting, the kind of electrical, the furniture. And so they turned to Pinterest, scrawling through design inspiration while they waited for deliveries which they were told could take three times longer than usual and battled with the fact that material costs had increased by  per cent. Once the workforce were allowed back on site, the challenge became adapting working environments to suit the restrictions which meant only two workers were allowed in the same room. Now, Sayu looks upon that period with a fresh perspective. He said: The good thing was, once you kind of go through that process, youaposre kind of unfazed by some of the smallest things which which may not go to your liking.  Sayu would encourage anyone that is able to attempt a renovation of this scale in the future and he has given his top tips which have now carried him through two back-to-brick renovations. He credits thorough planning, prioritising and having experienced people around you as some of the key things that helped the build. Definitely plan well ahead. Itaposs never an enjoyable process when youaposre put under pressure, he said. Experience always helps. And having a good project manager or build team is equally important. Things that donapost need to be done in the near futurewhile weaposve got the supply side issues, maybe wait until you have some kind ofof normality.Sayu and Sharon have set up an Instagram account to document their renovation journey called @that_ealing_feeling.The page has brought more benefits than just simply as a way to monitor their progress though. Sayu said they have found a community of like-minded people who he can turn to. He explained: What really helped us through, especially through the COVID time when nobody really knew what was going on, was this community and everybody encouraging each other, that we would get through this and be half sane at the end of this process. That kept us going. It was an incredible way to kind of capture ideas, create new friends, and then kind of leverage that community for anything, you know, be it mental health ideas, or kind of optimism.

Professor Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , told Times Radio it doesnapost do the virus any good to increase in severity, though new iants may prove to be even more transmissible than Omicron.He said that any new iant would need to out-compete Omicron through increased transmissibility or escape from immunity, and not through changes in severity.Covid has so far killed over , British people.It doesnapost do the virus any good to become increasingly severe, he said. In fact, it looks like the Omicron iant, by becoming more transmissible, that itaposs also become less severe, and we would hope thataposs the general direction of travel. He said that in future not everyone would need booster vaccines, adding: I think the people that we might want to think about boosting the most are the same as flu really - people with chronic illness and elderly people - and weaposll probably move into a sort of more regular annual vaccination programme, or it may not even need to be that frequent.  We need to wait for the evidence on that. Prof Hayward said he agreed the pandemic will end and people will live with the virus continuing to transmit but causing much less disruption. He added: It will tend to, I think, settle into a seasonal pattern - we may still get quite big winters of infection but not the sort of level where we can justy wholesale societal closedown.  So, I think it is genuinely an optimistic picture, but weaposre still not quite there yet. The University College Londonexpert said there were very encouraging signs of cases plateauing or dropping in some places, but nobody was sure whether they will stabilise at a very high level or dip down. The latest UK data shows , people were reported as positive for Covid on Monday, with the seven-day rolling average showing a % drop in cases in a week.  Meanwhile, hospital admissions remain fairly static, though they are falling in some parts of the country. New data from the Office for National Statisticsis due to be published on Wednesday afternoon which will show the level of infection across the community in people with and without symptoms. Across England there are currently , Covid patients in hospital, down from , a week ago.  Elsewhere, Dr David Nabarro said it is important that there is no premature promising that restrictions will end at a particular time after suggestions the Government will drop Plan B at the review stage on January .The World Health Organisationaposs special envoy on Covid- told BBC Breakfast: Iaposm a public health person ... I would not be making promises some time in the future because, once you make a promise, itaposs super hard then to change what youaposre going to do - you feel youaposre kind of doing a U-turn.This virus is constantly evolving and itaposs super hard to predict where it will be - we can say where we hope weaposre going to go, we can say where weaposd like to go, we can say what we think we need to do to get there - but making promises that weaposll do something on a particular date, I think, is unwise. Dr Nabarro reiterated his view that the situation in the UK gives us grounds for hope but continued to urge caution. The goal that weaposre all aiming for is a situation where this virus is present, but le is organised so that it is not disrupted, he said. We also need to be humble, this virus is continuing to evolve and weaposre never quite sure that we know exactly where itaposs going to go next.

Luckily a new study has revealed the friendliest - and grumpiest - parts of the UKThe West Midlands has been labelled the place with the friendliest neighbours. Its capital Birmingham is seen here Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByHarry Thompson:,  Jan | comments Choosing the right part of the country to move to can come down to a lot of factors, from jobs and schools to the general vibe.But one thing that is vital for most is living somewhere filled with nice people. Having good stock living near you to have your back, take in your mail and be a friendly face are all important factors of living in a community, and one that is more under threat than ever with todayaposs obsession with screens.Soyouaposre on the hunt for a new friendlier scene, research conducted by First Mortgage could be just what you need to find your kind of neighbourhood.Where in the UK has the grumpiest neighbours   The study found that people living in the North East are the most likely to have the grumpiest neighbours. A poll found that people living there are % likely to have a grumpy neighbour living near them. This was closely followed by Northern Ireland, where residents were % likely to have a grumpy neighbour. In third place was Wales, with a % likelihood. Where in the UK has the friendliest neighbours  If youaposre looking for a nice place to go and feel part of things, % of respondents in the West Midlands said that they felt welcomed by their neighbours. This is a good % above the national average of %. Yorkshire and the East Midlands also placed above the national average. % of respondents from Yorkshire said they had welcoming neighbours and % in the East Midlands. Perhaps surprisingly, the UK capital London also scored well with % of people who ed responses saying they felt their neighbours were welcoming.

The study also found that % of Brits would be happy to drop a parcel round to a neighbourit had been left with them, while a third of people would send their neighbour a Christmas card - and % said they would put their neighbouraposs bins out.  But the babs of the West Midlands have still got the sweetest deal, as itaposs the most likely area in the UK for you to receive an invite for a BBQ or dinner. Looking east and the people of East Anglia would be the most likely to have a neighbour who would feed their pet while they are away, while to the south, capital dwellers are the most likely to remember your birthday and send you a card. David McGrail of First Mortgage said: “Having kind neighbours can be really helpful, they are the ones most likely to be able to keep an eye on your property while you have a winter holiday and be around to help you out by taking in parcels. It really is those little things that can make a dference. Whilst it’s hard to put a price on it, good neighbours are worth every penny. “You can find the perfect property, in the perfect location, but after a few weeks you could be wishing you never moved. That’s the effect bad neighbours can have. While you never truly know what you are going to get, it is important that you try your best to get a feeling for what your neighbours are like.

However, a recent study of a fossilised elasmosaurus - which is a type of plesiosaur - has revealed that these prehistoric creatures didnapost hold their heads that way. Instead, the elasmosaurus held its head below or level with its body, Dr Paul Scofield, a curator at Canterbury Museum in New Zealand has said.Does the Loch Ness Monster exist  Have your say in the comment section He said: The labyrinth of the ear works best when the tiny bones within are able to hang unaffected by gravity. For this reason, the position of the inner ear within the skull of an animal reveals a lot about how an animal habitually holds its head. We have examined the inner ear of elasmosaurs and determined that their resting position was with the head horizontal to the body or even well below the body.  This implies that they probably did not frequently hold their heads up high. The theory that Nessie is a living elasmosaurus was promoted by Denys Tucker, once a prominent zoologist at Londonaposs Natural History Museum. He was allegedly fired in  over his beliefs and later died in France in . However, new research is shedding light on the dference between the popular image of Nessie and what a real elasmosaurus looks like.  Dr Scofield said: The apostraditionalapos posture shown in many a popular article on Nessie - like a sock puppet - is not something elasmosaurs were in the habit of adopting. The idea of it lting its head up like a sock puppet is extremely unlikely. The scientist and his colleagues made their findings conducting a CT scan on the elasmosaurus remains and it is thought the prehistoric creature held its head down this way to feed from the seabed.  Dr Scofield said: They have these enormous teeth arranged in rows like a grappling iron. It has been hypothesised that they floated on the surface and dredged the seafloor blowing the dirt out through their teeth and leaving just the clams. Thus their feeding method dictates the neck- itaposs just like the giraffe but in reverse. This theory may explain to believers why Nessie is rarely seen with its head above water.  However, Dr Scofield is sceptical that Nessie exists and says itaposs further proof that the monster is a myth. He said: I totally reject the idea that Nessie exists and that it is an elasmosaurus. Loch Ness monster records are a mixture of fakes and mistakes. Dr Scofield and his colleagues published their study into the lasmosaurus in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.  The  surgeonaposs photograph is now widely believed to be a hoax that was created with a toy submarine and wood putty. Dr Scofield also highlighted that the scientic name for Nessie proposed by conservationist Sir Peter Scott, Nessiteras rhombopteryx, is an anagram of Monster hoax by Sir Peter S.

Prince Harry has applied for a judicial review of a Home Office decision not to allow him to personally pay for police protection for himself and his family when they are in the UK, a legal representative has said.Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex have written a pre-action protocol letter to the Home Office. It reveals that they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security is not provided by the UK, when he and his family visit. What the Sussexes are looking for is full  hour protection from the police when they visit the UK - which is normally only given to royals or government officials.  Royal biographer Phil Dampier feels that this is a “very good excuse” for Meghan not toto the UK.Mr Dampier told The Sun : I donapost think Meghan will ever come back to this country and I think this is a very good excuse for not coming back - I donapost think realisticallyexpects to win this case.After stepping away from the Royal Family, Harry is now in effect a private citizen and it is claimed thathe was to receive protection then any high profile figure could also claim it.  But Mr Dampier continued: Getting his protection reinstated would set a precedent and so it gives them the perfect opportunity to say we can’t come to platinum jubilee celebrations. Harry might come over but it gives Meghan a good excuse not to come and also not to bring the children. This would also mean that the Queen would never get the chance to meet great granddaughter Lilibet and she only met Archie on a couple of occasions.  A legal representative for the Duke of Sussex said: Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.While his role within the Institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable toto his home.

Karen Fay, , said she wanted the ground to swallow her up when she could not ride the Nickelodeon Land ride in Blackpool with her youngster daughter Charlotte. Her seatbelt buckle wouldn’t fasten between Karen’s legs, meaning the ride could not start so she had to get off and walk back past a queue of onlookers. After the incident, Karen was so upset she joined Slimming World the next day. The mum-of-two used to feast on pork chops and chips, baguette and crisps and chocolatey snacks washed down with a glass of wine. But since switching to fruit snacks, healthier meals, and gin soda, she has dropped a whopping six dress sizes. After weighing st lb at her heaviest, Karen now weighs a trim st lb and has gone from a size  to a comfortable . “My little girl was four at the time and she wanted to go on the ride, she said. “I wasn’t going to go on, but the guy said do you want to go on it with her as they had adult seats so I said ‘okay, yeah’. “The ride couldn’t start because it wouldn’t buckle. I was absolutely mortied. I just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me. Karen, a director at her family-run specialist cleaning firm, piled on the pounds after having kids and weighed  st lbs after the birth of her second child Charlotte in . After the incident at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in , she decided to do finally something about her weight. She lost three stone following Slimming World’s food optimisation plans, but in  she struggled to reach the pedals of her new car which was another jolt.  Karen, who’s originally from Glasgow but now lives in Morecambe, Lancs., added: “We went back the next year and I made a point of riding the ride and it felt absolutely amazing. “I weighed about  stone, but I knew I could fit on the ride. “I was in and out the doors of Slimming World for a few years and in  we bought a new car and I could barely reach the pedals, I wasn’t comfortable at all. “I was up and down, I’d lose a couple of stone and put a stone back on.” In March , at the start of lockdown, Karen weighed  stone and was attending virtual Slimming World meetings. But when Lancashire was plunged into tier three restrictions in September, she decided she’d had enough of feeling unhappy with her weight and firmly stuck to the plan. By May , she had lost a total of st lbs and hit her initial target weight. But she knew she could lose more and lost another stone by September. Karen added: “I looked at myself in the mirror and I said to myself ‘get a grip’ and I got absolutely stuck in. “I’d started power walking and I had been challenged to do a couch to k in . In April , I ran my first k, it took me  minutes. “All through lockdown I kept up my running every day. The hour’s exercise we were allowed outside I spent running. “The weight started to come off, but I knew I could do more.” Now a slimline st lb, Karen has lost eight inches off her bust,  inches off her hips and a whopping  inches off her waist.  Before, Karen would start the day with cereal and full fat milk or toast with butter followed by a baguette, salad bowl, chocolate bar and crisps and pork chops and chips for dinner. Now she enjoys porridge or wholemeal toast with scrambled egg no butter for brekky, home made soups or pasta for lunch and salmon, air-fried potatoes and veg for dinner. Her snacking habits have switched from crisps and chocolate to fresh fruit and she now enjoys gin sodas instead of wine. Karen credits the dramatic weight loss with changing her le giving her back her self-esteem and confidence. Now a confident runner, Karen completes a k three times a week and looks almost unrecognisable in photographs. And she has trained as a Slimming World consultant which she does in her spare time to help inspire others to follow in her footsteps. She added: “I weighed  and a half stone after the birth of my second child and I was miserable. “My first thought every day was about my size, my weight and what clothes I was going to wear. I never felt comfortable. “I think my whole attitude to le is more positive now. “I’m happy, I’ve been successful at losing the weight and it’s given me a new lease of le. “It’s given me my sparkle back. I had been involved in amateur dramatics and have been on stage, but a lot of the time it’s just a mask. “But now my confidence levels are sky high. I hope I can help other people get their sparkle.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Slimming WorldFitnessWeight loss success stories\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Vet practices in the region shared warnings on Facebook, urging owners to avoid beaches in Scarborough and Saltburn.But it would appear the bug is now moving inland as Brits in towns and cities, including Hebden Bridge, York, and Sheffield, reported similar symptoms. One person posted on a group in Hebden Bridge saying: The dog sickness bug is spreading here like wildfire. My dog came down it on Thursday and I had only taken her to school and back!  The vet said every other dog he has seen has this bug. She said that her dog was fine now but that her motheraposs dog had now come down with the same illness. She said: Just be careful as they donapost know what the cause is or how itaposs spreading. Another person from Sheffield posted saying that there was a nasty bug doing the rounds that will knock your dog off its feet. They added that the virus is spreading like wildfire and is in most areas and had caused her dog to vomit and have diarrhoea, which were similar symptoms to the virus reported from the coast. Emily Storey, from York, warned others about the illness - which she said was taking longer than normal to recover from - after her six-month old cockapoo Loki became ill last week. She said that she had taken him on walks around Copmanthorpe and discovered that other dogs in the area had fallen ill with a similar illness. She said that he was also vomiting and had diarrhoea and that he was not eating properly. She also said that when she took him to the vets she was told that it seems to be worse than usual. In Leeds, a woman was walking her dog at Hunslet canal before it also caught the mystery illness. She said she thinks the virus came from the coast but is now being spread from dog to dog in the city. But one of the vets at the Minster Veterinary Practice played down the idea that a new illness was affecting canines though, saying that she didnapost think there was a new illness in York. She said: We often unfortunately get waves of unwell pets with vomiting and diarrhoea around this time of year, just as in the summer we often get cases of kennel cough. I did mention to a client at Willow Grove that I had seen a few cases of vomiting and diarrhoea, but this can be a normal occurrence this time of year. Any cases that have had to be hospitalised due to vomiting and diarrhoea have responded to supportive care. My main advice to any pet owners would be thatyour pet is unwell then seek veterinary attention,we have a mild stomach upset then a bland diet is little and often is a good idea. Please be reassured thatwe felt that there was something pet owners should avoid or minimise to stop their pet becoming generally unwell then we would advise of this.

Now, Lady Victoria has told how she was befriended by the couple during an ITV documentary, which is due to air at pm today.The -year-old former IT girl said during her time with Maxwell, Epstein kind of sat back and sort of waited for her to sort of go fishing for girls. The daughter of the th marquess of Bristol told how she met the pair  years ago saying she was really young and naïve at the time. Speaking on ITVaposs Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile documentary, Lady Victoria said Maxwell and Epstein were like Batman and Robin and were a double act. She said: Jeffrey was really the frontman and Ghislaine was the accomplice. It was kind of like a Batman and Robin, and they were a double act. I donapost think Jeffrey could have done any of it without Ghislaine. Presenter Ranvir Singh said: And Ghislaine was crucial to getting those girls, was she, do you think to those dinners Lady Victoria responded: I think he just kind of sat back and sort of waited for her to sort of go fishing and go find however many girls were needed, you know, to entertain his friends. I think I was pretty much used as bait.  You know, looking back at, you know I was really young and naïve, and sheaposs entertaining these, you know, big businessmen. So I didnapost realise it of course at the time, but looking back. At one point Lady Victoria appeared to show some sympathy towards Maxwell, who faces up to  years in prison when she is sentenced in June. I think Ghislaine was a victim and is a victim,” she said.  She was a victim that then became the accomplice as her role changed in that relationship when they were no longer together. She kind of switched sides. I do see her as a victim as well.” She added: “She is a scapegoat right now, so unfortunately for her, she is being taken down for what he has done as well. Some might argue is not quite as fair as it could be.” On Tuesday, Lady Victoria appeared from Los Angeles on ITVaposs Lorraine show.  “Shehasn’t really named any new names yet,” she told the host. “I am hoping for the people involved, for a lesser jail sentence, she will start giving out some names. “But I don’t think we are quite there yet, especially with the situation of the jury member.” One of Maxwell’s  jurors, Scotty David, revealed after the conviction he had suffered child abuse saying how it helped shape the ’s decision. It later emerged the -year-old, who appears in the documentary, had not disclosed his past when asked during jury selection. Maxwellaposs lawyers have called for a retrial, claiming the case was unfairly influenced. At one point in tonightaposs documentary, Singh rles through Epsteinaposs black book of contacts. She finds Prince Andrewaposs mobile number and tried calling it only to hit a voicemail. It is not knownthe Duke of York still owns the number. Amanda Knox, who was cleared of British students Meredith Kercher’s death, yesterday weighed in the case saying much of the interest in the Maxwell was because she is a woman. The -year-old said: I do think that part of the reason why thereaposs so much public interest in this case, is because we wanted to hold Epstein accountable, and sheaposs the next best thing. So I was in the one sense, pointing to the fact that, you know, Maxwell was obviously guilty of these terrible crimes and should be held accountable for her crimes. “But also, we should be careful and mindful as a society when we have such raging interest in some cases over others. “And wasnapost this just another example of the reason why we really, really cared about this case was because it was the opportunity to vily a woman for sex crimes.” Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellLady Victoria HerveyPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkITVDocumentariesRoyal FamilyJeffrey Epstein\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of York, , would “scream and shout”his servants failed to place them exactly how he wanted at Buckingham Palace, ex protection officer Paul Page tells ITV ’s Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile.A handwritten guide is said to have included two hippos, a black panther and bears, as well as three cushions called aposDaddyapos, aposDucksapos and aposPrinceapos. It showed exactly where to place blankets, as well as five toys and a fur, which had ribbons that had to hang off the side of the bed.  The instructions were laminated and titled “DOY bed: Points for turn down  making the bed”, with Andrew keeping the accompanying sketch close to his bed while staying at the Palace. Staff wrote: “When the DOY is staying overnight, place one small teddy  cushion in the turn down. “When making the bed, place the teddy  cushion next to the teddy on the left- hand side with the necklaces on.”  Underneath in capital letters, it stressed: “Do not loosethe teddy  cushion!!” The sketch showed a teddy holding a heart had to be put on the left of the headboard and a grey hippo on the right, while the panther was halfway down. A second hippo was to be put on a green throw at the end of the bed. A source told The Sun: “It’s hilarious a Prince of England would want his teddies on his bed. You can imagine him crying, ‘Mummy, they haven’t put the hippos on my bed!’ to the Queenanyone got it wrong.Maybe they were presents from his daughters or Fergie, but it’s still strange.” Page worked in Royalty and Specialist Protection Command between  and  and had access to the princeaposs private quarters.In this apartment, the Duke had a bed piled high with stuffed animals and toys, Page claims.He said: “It had about  or  stuffed toys positioned on the bed and basically there was a card the inspector showed us in a drawer and it was a picture of these bears all in situ. “The reason for the laminated picture wasthose bears weren’t put back in the right order by the maids, he would shout and scream.” Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile - is being aired on ITV on Tuesday at pm. ITV says host Ranvir Singh will unravel the story of how Maxwell sank into shame and disgrace through her friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. And will also explore how Andrew became embroiled in the scandal as he faces his own possible civil court case brought by Virginia Giuffre. Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations made by Ms Giuffre against him. A representative for the Duke declined to comment on the remarks about soft toys.

The Prince of Wales has expressed his firm wish to spend quality time with his grandchildren, having not seen Archie since he was six months old and not ever meeting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s baby daughter, Lilibet Diana, who was born in June.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and his we Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood.But Charles’s good natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. It was thought that Harry and Meghan would certainly make an effort to attend events to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee in June.What do you make of our exclusive story  Have your say in the comment section Harry is understood to have told family members he would attend a memorial service for his late grandfather Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey, which is planned for April.However, it has emerged that the Duke of Sussex claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the royal family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Harry, , has since decided to sue the British government by applying for a judicial review against the decision, which could see him face the Home Office at the court. Royal sources have confirmed the Prince of Wales has held several “good natured and enjoyable” video calls with his son, Meghan and the children during the past few months.

One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children. “This is something he is hoping to remedy which is why he made the gesture for Harry, Meghan and the children to stay with himthey wanted to, whenever they may come home for a period of time. “In the meantime there has been a series of good natured and enjoyable calls between them all which is something the prince very much looks forward to.” In the calls Charles, , has made it clear to his son of his wish to spend quality time with two-year-old Archie and seven-month-old baby Lilibet. Harry’s relationship with his family is understood to have been fractured following his exit from The Firm in , and subsequent decision last year to appear with Meghan, , in a tell-all interview with US chat show queen Oprah Winfrey. The couple beamoned their treatment by the family, with Harry accusing his father of cutting him off financially and further claiming a senior member of the family made racist remarks about the colour of his unborn children’s skin. Sources close to Charles have told The Mirror that despite reports of the two not speaking, Charles and Harry have been on “a journey of rediscovery” in terms of their relationship.  One said: “The Prince of Wales has spoken to his son frequently in recent months. He loves him very much, as he does both his children, and he looks forward to them being able to spend time together in the near future.” Harry and Meghan, now live in an £million mansion in the millionaires’ playground of Montecito, Calornia, have not spent any time out of the United States since their move in . Harry is however also expected to attend the Invictus Games, which he founded, in The Hague, the Netherlands, in April.Since their exit from the family they have signed deals worth an estimated £million with streaming giants Netflix and Spoty, with the capability to earn hundreds of millions of dollars having become “financially independent”.Clarence House were approached and declined to comment on private family matters.

He protected each and every one of us. Now he wants to do the same for his we and kids, but he’s having to fight for that right.Harry can make all the controversial personal choices he likes, but there’s one thing he can never change. The family he was born into. The result of this, as explained in his most recent ­statement, is that he “inherited a security risk at birth, for le”. If Harry was demanding protection while in the UK for free, the uproar he’s faced over the last few days might be understandable. But he isn’t.  He’s just asking to be allowed to buy ­something he needs. But where your family’s ­essentials might be bread and milk, his are round-the-clock armed protection from neo-Nazis, extremists and everyone in between. He’s more than happy to pay for this himself. Unlike The Artist Formerly Known As Prince Andrew, who may have had a few titles and trappings removed but for whose security we all still foot the bill.There’s an argument thatHarry’s allowed to hire the ­politan Police’s royal protection squad it sets a precedent that any old celebrity or rich, famous businessperson who fancies it can too. Nonsense. Those people have chosen to be recognisable, and so are responsible for themselves. Harry is forever the Queen’s grandson whether he likes it or not.He’s genuinely the exception to the rule. The suggestion he employs a private ­security team is a non-starter. As former royal protection officer Ken Wharfe admits: “It’s next to impossible for independent security contractors to match the standards of police protection. They’re not automatically allowed access to UK intelligence, or given the freedom of royal palaces without the necessary clearance. “In Britain it’s illegal for anyone except police and the military to carry firearms.”  It’s obvious why the safety of his family is something Harry is not willing to compromise on. And also why he’s willing to go to unprecedented legal s to ensure the very best protection available for them. He’s already lost too much. What you think about everything  Harry has done – the way he’s chosen to live his le and how he’s gone about it – is irrelevant. This is a separate issue. And it’s quite simple. Really, although the circumstances are more extreme, he only wants what we all do. To keep his precious loved ones safe. We don’t have to pay for Harry’s security, we just have to allow him to have access to it. After everything he’s been through, all he’s done for this country, is that really too much to ask  Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Daily MirrorPrince Harry in AfghanistanPrince HarryMeghan MarkleRoyal FamilyThe QueenPrince Andrew, Duke of Yorkpolitan Police Service\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace. Now, just three weeks away from the beginning of her Platinum Jubilee year, Her Majesty is facing down another petulant member of her family for reasons she would be forgiven for assuming had been sorted.

Royal expert Ingrid Seward has said: She explains: Prince Harryaposs threat of legal action against his grandmotheraposs government will not sit kindly with her. The Queen does not like being threatened.During his time as a royal and after stepping down with we Meghan Markle, Harry has made several requests - some that have needed the Queenaposs permission.But there also appears to have been several times, when she has firmly put her foot down... Tiara requestOne request that left Harry overwrought concerned the tiara Meghan wore on her wedding day in May .Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. According to the unauthorised biography Meghan: A Hollywood Princess by Andrew Morton, Harry made his feelings clear when the tiara could not be made available for Meghanaposs hair fitting with her stylist before the big day. He writes: The prince, who needed acupuncture to stay calm in the run-up to the wedding, was overwrought when the chosen tiara could not be made instantly available for Meghan’s hairdresser Serge Normant, who had flown from New York to work on the hair fitting. The Queen’s formidable dresser Angela Kelly, who isof the Queen’s jewellery, is said to have informed the irate prince that certain security protocols had to be adhered to in order to access the priceless piece. A source revealed that he was told: ‘They’re kept under very tight lock and key. You can’t turn up and demand to have the tiara just because your hairdresser happens to be in town.’ Harry would have none of it, telling anyone who would listen: ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.’ His ringing phrase did her no favours. Living arrangements Weeks after Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, the couple faced disappointment when the Monarch rejected a request they made about their home.According to the Sunday Times, the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle.The report, written by Roya Nikkhah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead.Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate. He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there. Military titles  In , Harry and Meghan stepped down as working royals in order to set up a new le in America.And with it, they were stripped of their honorary military appointments and royal patronages.The monarch forced the pair to sever all official links with The Firm after they decided to renounce their duties and step away from public service for good. Among the titles that were taken away was Harryaposs military appointment of Captain General of the Royal Marines. Buckingham Palace said: Following conversations with The Duke, The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of The Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a le of public service. The honorary military appointments and Royal patronages held by The Duke and Duchess will therefore be ed to Her Majesty, before being redistributed among working members of The Royal Family. While all are saddened by their decision, The Duke and Duchess remain much-loved members of the family. A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan replied and said: As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role. We can all live a le of service. Service is universal. Royal styles As well as being stripped of their military titles and royal patronages, Harry and Meghan also had to agree to not use their HRH styles. Although the pair werenapost stripped of these by the Queen, they no longer use the style as they arenapost working members of the royal family. Remembrance wreath request  In November , Harry made a request to have a wreath laid on his behalf at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday. Despite Harry having served for  years in the military, including two tours of Afghanistan, his request for his tribute to be laid at the London memorial last year was refused.In his book Battle of Brother, royal author Robert Lacey argues most people would consider Harryaposs request perfectly reasonable and a mark of respect but he adds that the Queen is said to have rejected the request as soon as it reached her attention. It took her aposall of two secondsapos to issue a refusal, Lacey writes, referring to an article by royal editor Rebecca English. The article stated the Cenotaph ceremony was sacrosanct to The Queen, who ensured nothing happened without her knowledge. While Harryaposs grandmother hugely admired her grandsonaposs military achievements, his request to lay a wreath, or have one laid on his behalf, showed a lack of understanding of what it means for him to be a non-working royal, the book claims. Security issuesMeanwhile, when it comes to Harry latest request for police protection for his family when in the UK, it has been reported that the Queen wonapost help his case.He and we Meghan, , lost their taxpayer-funded police protection after quitting their royal roles in . The couple, who live in Calornia with their children Archie, two, and seven-month-old Lilibet, fund their own security there. The Duke of Sussex claimed he is effectively in exile because it is “unsafe” for his family toto the UK. He claims his private security arrangements are not enough to ensure his family’s safety and privacy here.A royal source told the Sun : “This is not a matter for Her Majesty. She certainly won’t cave into his demands.“It is a matter for Her Majesty’s government. Who gets protection is not a gt the Queen can decide to give or take away.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryRoyal FamilyMeghan MarkleQueen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The chocolate cockapoo named Biddy discovered his voice at three-months-old and has been singing along to sirens and songs ever since. Biddy became famous in Edinburgh, Scotland, for “helping the ambulances to be heard” and cannot help but stop and bark whenever he hears a siren. The gted dog also knows all of the words to rock band Kodaline’s album and will sing his furry heart out to their songs at home. “It’s ashe knows the words,” dog owner Rachel said. In the video, the chocolate cockapoo barks long and loud to the sounds of the ambulance passing in the street. He is completely engrossed in copying the noise and doesn’t finish howling until the sirens are no longer heard. It’s asthe dog is trying to mimic and strengthen the wailing sound. His owner Rachel Flynn, from Edinburgh, Scotland, explained: “Biddy howls whenever he hears sirens - it’s ashe is helping the ambulances to be heard.” PR Officer Rachel and her partner Jordan welcomed the cockapoo puppy into their home in June . They named Biddy after the Irish pub, Biddy Mulligans, in the Edinburgh Grassmarket, where they met in . When he had been with them for just a few weeks, Jordan discovered Biddy’s talent for singing. “Jordan was driving in his work van listening to Kodaline when Biddy started howling loudly,” Rachel explained. “Jordan didn’t know whether to interrupt him or not, but Biddy was far too distracted singing away. “As soon as they came home, Jordan put Kodaline on to show me and Biddy did it again.” The -month-old dog is still Kodaline’s number one fan, and will only sing to the band’s songs and emergency services’ sirens. “It’s ashe knows the words,” Rachel said. “If we start singing a Kodaline song, Biddy will join in.” When Rachel, Jordan and Biddy used to live in Edinburgh city centre, there would be sirens constantly in the street. “He became very famous in our little local area. Everyone knew Biddy in the pubs, cafes, hairdressers and pharmacies,” Rachel said. “There would be water bowls laid out for him and treats behind the counter.” Rachel describes Biddy as “the most hilarious pup in the world” and “a wee monkey”. Biddy is amazing with children and loves to play with Rachel’s five nieces and nephews, especially two-year-old Maisie. When Biddy isn’t singing, he’s sleeping, eating vegetables or digging holes in the garden.And he is currently Rachel’s running buddy while she trains for a marathon to fundraise for her workplace and dedicated charity,Worldwide Cancer Research . You’ll often find Biddy on the cancer charity’s social media as he’s the mascot for itslottery campaign . The cockapoo also has his ownInstagram account , where you can spot more videos of him howling to sirens.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Em J, now , was  stone at her heaviest and says she was dependent on sugary drinks and late-night takeaways.It wasnapost until her mum confronted her about her health that Em decided to make a change, LiverpoolECHO reports. The waitress said: When I look at pictures of me at  stone it really is frightening. I was suffering severe depression, anxiety and I was so dependent on full-fat, sugary drinks. I was ordering takeaways at  or  o’clock in the morning and that’s when I really started to gain weight. I was only , but physically I felt like I was in my s. I was suffering severe dizzy spells, to the point in time where I didn’t leave my house for six months due to the repercussions of the dizziness, and I was having palpitations, shortness of breath and chronic fatigue. I also struggle with dyspraxia and agoraphobia on top of that, which made le feel unbearable at times.” Em has lost eight stone just  months after cutting out fizzy drinks by finding sugar-free alternatives to curb her cravings. She even appeared on Channel  ’s ‘Lose Weight Like Me’ to inspire the nation as a ‘Weight Loss Hero’.The content created said: “What saved my le was transitioning to a low-sugar lestyle. With the help of The Skinny Food Co’s products, I discovered alternatives that were low in calories and sugar but still felt like a treat as they tasted just as good.  I’m also so happy I’ve been able to find alternatives to the sugary drinks I used to be addicted to. I’m a big cocktail lover and working as a barmaid, I know how dficult it is to find low-sugar, low-calorie alcoholic drinks that are delicious too. Sharing a few unique tricks and mindset shts towards food that made the healthy diet stick, Em J said: Once I started eating healthier, I realised that my addiction was mostly in my head.  Simple tricks such as pretending The Skinny Food Co’s Skinny Malts were the real deal or putting a Skinny Food Fakeaway into the takeaway boxes I used to order still made the food feel like a treat.” Em has also started walking at least two miles every day to get herself outside. She said: The combination of eating healthier and moving my body really helped regenerate my health.  It was about changing habits slowly and in a way that wasn’t too overwhelming. The Skinny Food Co was a big motivation by allowing me to enjoy the pleasure of treats, but in a healthy way. It felt like a win, win! My advice is to understand that you’re human. We all have setbacks and there is no quick fix to overcoming them. It’s about discovering what works for you and making small adaptations at first, then the progress will follow.

Tell me, what is the monkey doing , the operator asks as Travisaposs harrowing, almost gleeful, wails and screeches echo down the line. He ripped her apart! Hurry up! Hurry up! Please!” Herold breathlessly replies. “He—he ripped her face off! Heaposs eating her face! “Gun! They got to shoot him! Please! Please! Hurry! Hurry! Please! I can’t. I can’t … He’s eating her! He’s eating her! Please! God! Please! Where are they  Where are they ” Officers did come and Travis was killed. Astonishingly, his victim, Charla Nash, survived, but you could argue that in many ways, her le too came to an abrupt end that day.  Charla, a friend of Travisapos aposmomapos Sandra, had been asked to pop over to help put the pampered ape in his enclosure - but, uncharacteristically, he snapped, attacking her and gnawing off her face and hands. In a show of terrying primal strength, Travis ripped off her eyelids and tore off her nose. He scalped her, gouged out and ate her eyes, chewed off one of her hands entirely and almost tore one of her arms off. Her jaw was entirely dislocated from her skull and she was left with brain damage. It is still not known why Travis - a local celebrity who would eat lobster in restaurants, had a pet cat, and loved driving around on a lawnmower - flipped out the way that he did that day.  Sandra later admitted giving him a dose of strong anti-anxiety medicine Xanax in his daily cup of tea earlier that day when she noticed that he was aposagitatedapos. She also claimed that he behaved viciously because Charla was wearing her hair dferently. But it could also have been that at the age of , the lbapeaposs instincts had simply become too strong - or that he was simply sick of his unnatural lestlye of cooking his own microwave meals, drinking wine at dinner, and using the toilet like a human. Sandra had owned Travis since he was just three days old, paying a breeder , for the infant chimp.  His mum was shot with a tranquiliser dart so that he could be stolen away - and from that moment on, he was no longer a chimpanzee, but Sandraaposs apossonapos. To outsiders they had an unbreakable bond, and even shared a bed after Sandraaposs husband died. After the attack on February , , the then -year-old told reporters: He couldnapost be more my son thanI gave birth to him. But everything has a breaking point, and for Sandra, that came when she saw her beloved aposlittle boyapos mauling her best friend.  Due to Charlaaposs horric injuries, Sandra was the only person able to explain exactly what had prompted the attack. She claimed Travis approached Charla aggressively before getting onto his hind legs and launching the savage attack, throwing her against the side of her car before gorging on her face and hands. Desperate, Sandra stabbed him in the back with a carving kne and battered him over the head with a shovel in a bid to make him stop, which it did for a moment. She recalled how he turned around and looked at her, before she ran for her le and locked herself in her car.  Sandra said: “I grabbed the shovel and hit him with the shovel to stop it. It wasnapost working, so I went and I had to get a kne — and I stabbed him. I had to. He looked at me like, ‘Mom, what did you do ’” When police arrived, Travis was in a frenzy of bloodlust. He opened one of their patrol caraposs doors and lunged at an officer. Despite being shot four times at point blank range Travis didnapost die. He ran back in to the house, and collapsed dead on his special bed, leaving a trail of blood behind him.  The gunshots are heard in the background of Sandraaposs breathless  call. When paramedics arrived on the scene they were unable to decipher the victimaposs gender due to the severity of the wounds. Like something from a horror film, strips of flesh and scalp had been flung around the yard of Sandraaposs Stamford, Connecticut, home. They assumed that Charla, who was a mass of bloodied flesh with no recognisable facial features slumped in a pool of her own blood, was dead - until she moved. They sprung into action, and managed to save her le.  The brutal attack had caused her to lose half of her blood and she would later undergo a face transplant. Sadly, a pioneering hand transplant was rejected by her body. After the incident, NBC reporter Jeff Rossen asked Sandra: “After what youaposve been through with this — your friend is in the hospital fighting for her le — do you still think chimps should be pets  She replied: “Would I have done it again  Yes! Theyaposre the closest thing to humans — to us. “We can give them a blood transfusion, and they can give us one. How many people go crazy and kill other people  This is one incident that I donapost know what happened. “It was a horrible thing. But Iaposm not a horrible person. And he wasnapost a horrible chimp. It was a freak thing.”  Fteen months later Sandy died from an aneurysm. She was buried with two urns beside her. One was her daughteraposs, the other belonged to Travis. The only survivor of that hideous day is Charla Nash, who now lives in darkness, wearing someone aposs face and entirely dependent on the staff at the care home where she will spend the rest of her days. Ahead of the face transplant she spoke to Oprah Winfrey, and rued the loss of the le she loved. She said: Iaposve never been a quitter. Unfortunately, thereaposs not a whole lot I can do. “I’ve lost so much independence. I could change my own truck tyre, and now I can’t even feed myself. Itaposs very hard to live. Not even live - half-live. “Sometimes you want to cry, you want out, you want some kind of home. I donapost know what my future is, thataposs the scary part.

Kacey Wheeler recently had a washing machine delivered from the electrical retailer and claims the delivery man couldnapost stop staring at her when doing the drop off in Bradford last week. The -year-old even called her fiance Ryan Sager shortly afterwards to joke the man, known only as Jordan, was in love with her, but they were both gobsmacked when he texted her  minutes later. What Jordan didnapost know, however, was that the mobile number on the order sheet actually belonged to Ryan - as the washing machine had been a gt from his parents. As soon as I opened the door I saw one of the guys just didnapost take his eyes off me. I didnapost take it in a weird way at first and I thought it was funny. He was just staring at me, Kacey said. The other guy just came in, dropped the washer and then left, but the other guy didnapost want to leave. He was lingering around telling me where to put it and opening draws. It was really creepy but at the time I just thought it was strange. I was winding Ryan up telling him the driver was in love with me, then I thought he was joking when he said heaposd got texts from him. I canapost believe he just took the number off the sheet and he knows where we live. Evenheaposd have come into my house and asked for my number it wouldnapost have been as weird.Not happy at the driveraposs advances, Ryan decided to embarrass Jordan by engaging in a flirty six-hour text exchange, which he later shared to Facebook.Posing as his six-months-pregnant fiancee, Ryan began chatting with Jordan who bragged about being a former prison bad boy and cheekily suggested they should meet up to get this washer sorted. In the six-hour chat Ryan, , even asked Jordan, who claimed to be chilling at Currys self-employed, to be his sugar daddy after he bragged about earning £, per year. Electrician Ryan believes he aposintimidatedapos the delivery worker with his late-night request of a threesome and description of naughty bedroom kinks - including a request he dress up as a Marvel superhero. When the Currys driver tried to continue the chat the next day, Ryan abruptly cut him off saying, f*** off now, Iaposm bored, before revealing Jordan had actually been talking to Kaceyaposs fiance for hours. Despite the light-hearted prank to waste Jordanaposs time, Ryan has been angered by the delivery manaposs cheek and Kacey now says sheaposs afraid to accept deliveries without her fiance in the house. Ryan said: Thereaposs my shoes in the house, Kaceyaposs six months pregnant and sheaposs got an engagement ring on. Itaposs just utter disrespect. When I got the phone call and the text came through I was annoyed, but then I thought Iaposd make a laugh out of it. I thought aposIaposm going to [pull] your legapos. My favourite bit was asking him to dress up in a Marvel costume and him replying that heaposs a prison boy. He was trying to big himself up. Itaposs embarrassing. He deserves to have the mick taken out of him. From the texts you can tell heaposs a very strange guy. I thought Iaposd scared him off on the night, talking about a threesome, but then when he messaged back the next day and I wasnapost having a good day at work so I just told him to f*** off. Iaposm happy heaposs wasted all that time. Every time I put something provocative, heaposd have been sitting there on his couch sweating, thinking aposwhat do I do with his girlapos. He thought heaposd pulled. If it was me Iaposd have felt tiny. I hope he feels like an idiot. If he came back to the house heaposd get it, but itaposs a shame for Kacey. You shouldnapost be made uncomfortable by delivery drivers like that. Currys said they were treating the matter aposvery seriouslyapos and confirmed they are currently investigating it.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

They nicknamed their finding, which weighs twice as much as the average newborn, ‘Doug’. However, now, the New Zealand found spud will have to undergo DNA analysis to prove it’s a spud before it can claim its spot in the record books. This has left the couple dejected and feeling betrayed. Colin confirmed that they were requiring that a sample of Doug be sent to Scotland despite the experts, agronomists and field scientists the couple have had to very the find.  He said: “Do they think I genetically modied it  It’s been a rollercoaster of emotion. “While it’s extremely deflating, I want to prove them wrong. We will do everything they ask of us.” A bit of Doug will end up at Researchers at Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculturewho provide agricultural advice to the Scottish government.  They will genotype Doug to confirm he is a potato and possibly what iety he is too. The Guinness World Records confirmed they were in touch with the biology department but Sasa has not yet received the bit of Doug. The couple described the potato as their “happy little mistake of nature” they came across when the hoe struck something large. Speaking to Stuff, Colin said: “It’s a hideous looking creature. “It’s the sort of thing that only a mother could love.” The couple think the potato is self-sown and could have been growing for a couple of years or more.  Whilst they await confirmation to seeDoug will take his place in the annals of history, they have built a small cart to tow the potato around town and show it off. However, Colin is concerned about how long the potato will last for as it has already started to lose weight as it dries out and turns mouldy. To ensure some preservation he has stored it in a freezer. The current heaviest potato was found in Britain in  and weight only just under kg, far less than Doug.

Now one person believes theyaposve spotted a pretty major one in Deathly Hallows, the seventh film of the fantasy franchise.Potter fan Brenna took to TikTok @bihlito share the theory, in which she says Dumbledore is the real villain. In a video that has been viewed more than . million times, she laid out her argument.In Deathly Hallows, we see Bill Weasley and Fleuraposs cottage being used as a safe house for Harry Potteraposs allies in the wizarding war. This is because Bill is a secret keeper, which means he has been selected to hide a secret by means of the Fidelius Charm. The person who told the secret can then no longer pass on the information that has been given to the secret keeper, and only they , can reveal it.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. They are then able to tell as many people as they like, but only on a voluntary basis - it must not be tortured or blackmailed out of them. And as a Weasley, the Order of the Phoenix can trust Bill to keep Harry Potter’s whereabouts hidden. However, Brenna questioned why Harryaposs parents, Lily and James, werenapost secret keepers of Harryaposs whereabouts instead. When Voldemort tried to kill Harry, the couple were forced to go into hiding, and Peter Pettigrew was their secret keeper, who ended up telling Voldemort where they were. Therefore, fans believe this makes Albus Dumbledore - the Hogwarts headmaster - the true villain as he seemingly orchestrated the events that would see Lily and James killed so that he could use Harry to defeat Voldemort himself. Since being posted, the video has racked up more than , likes and , comments from fans who were quick to share their surprise at the plot hole. Because Dumbledore is the villain she didnapost mean to write, said one person. Another wrote: Dumbledore was such a gaslighter. All this horrible stuff happens to Harry and D tells him it’s because aposI cared for you too much!apos A third commented: JK Rowling would be distressed to be asked a question like that. Someone  put: This is because Dumbledore needed either Sirius or Remus to go to prison so neither of them could take care of Harry and he could send him to his aunt. But others werenapost convinced by her theory as one person said: Dumbledore isnapost the villain. Heaposs extremely complex but heaposs all for the greater good. The end goal outweighs the casualties, in his opinion. Iaposm confused why people are saying Dumbledore is a civilian  asked another. Adding: He literally offers to be the Potters secret keeper and they turned him down.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Hailey, from Atlanta in the US, became the owner of the  hearse after her previous vehicle was hit by a truck, leaving her injured and out of work for two months. So, when investing in a new car, she thought one that everyone would slow down for would be perfect. If they were going to hit me they were going to feel bad about it, she explained in one clip. Another obvious perk of driving a hearse is the space in the back, where Hailey has strategically placed a bed, which she uses to nap on during really long days when sheaposs working in theatre - so she can catch up on rest during her lunch breaks. She added: Itaposs also just really cosy to hang out with friends back here. I am definitely excited to take it on a road trip one day. Hailey, who says sheaposs experienced paranormal activity in the past, promises that her hearse is not haunted, despite having carried approximately  dead bodies to funerals during its two decades of service.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The blizzard led to snowfalls more than ft deep which blocked doors and windows, reaching as high as the first floor in some areas. She was eventually found  hours after she initially went missing while ing from school. It took the search team  hours to find and rescue the youngster.  To keep herself alive, she was hugging a fluffy dog for warmth, according to local media. When found, Vika was lying with the stray mongrel on a mattress which animal-loving locals had put out for homeless pooches. It was lodged under a low balcony where they could shelter from the storm.  Local media initially reported she clambered into a kennel, which was later corrected. “She was taken straight to hospital, and found to have mild frostbite,” said a local source. She had left school at pm, and was found next morning at :am. Olesya Voznyuk, an official with the Investigative Committee, said: “She was hiding under a balcony with the dog. The girl loves animals very much, she used to play with local dogs all the time.“She went to feed these dogs after school and then got caught in the snow storm and strong winds.” The space under the balcony gave some shelter but it still took more than  people over  hours to find her from when her parents raised the alarm .  Her “relieved” mother Tatyana, , was reunited with Vika at hospital. The girl was allowed home the same day . Now there are plans to honour the dog that saved Vika -they can find it after the pooch went missing.

A team working for TV channel Sat. have handed the evidence to detectives probing Brueckner over the infamous case.British youngster Madeleine was just three-years-old when she vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment in Portugal in . German prosecutors claim to have evidence she is dead and named convicted paedophile Brueckner as their only suspect. Despite going public with the information in June , they have still not charged him with any offence. But now Sat. investigators claim to have found fresh evidence linking Brueckner, who denies any involvement, to the crime. They will reveal more information about their investigation in a prime-time documentary, which is yet to have an air date. Announcing the show, Sat. said journalist Jutta Rabe and a team of reporters gathered new information about Brueckner. They claim it includes proof he was near Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished while her parents dined in a tapas restaurant. The channel said they collected “many new clues and indications” that corroborate the suspicions of German prosecutors. Editor-in-chief Juliane Ebling said: “The sad story of Madeleine McCann is a story that has many German facets. “The case is being tried at the Regional Court of Braunschweig, as the German Christian B. is the main suspect.  “In his environment there are many German women and men who can describe inidual details surrounding the crime. “Jutta Rabe has researched shocking material in Germany, Portugal and England over the past months, which heavily incriminates Christian B.” Sat. confirmed the show will be airing on German TV but said “no exact broadcast date has been set”. When contacted by the Mirror, chief public prosecutor Hans-Christian Wolters was unavailable for comment. His office confirmed in December that they soon hope to charge Brueckner with raping a woman in Portugal. He is suspected of attacking Irish waitress Hazel Behan in the Algarve three years before Madeleine vanished.  She waived her right to anonymity two years ago to come forward and accuse Brueckner of attacking her in . The German, , is already serving a jail term for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz in . Mr Wolters said he is % convinced” Brueckner also killed Madeleine, who was just three when she vanished. The German was living in a camper van close to Praia da Luz when Madeleine disappeared. Police first became aware of him as a suspect in  but only went public with the information in June . Since then senior investigators have interviewed a string of potential key witnesses in Germany and Portugal.

In a series of videos, Uziel Martínez, from Baja Calornia, Mexico said he had heroically stepped in to save his exaposs mother by donating the organ. Sadly for the teacher, donating an organ to his mother-in-law wasnapost enough to rescue his relationship, which ended less than a month after the operation. To add insult to injury, Uzielaposs ex has since married another man.

The “rescue” left onlookers stunned, as orcas are typically known to feast on humpbacks in the ocean - injured or otherwise. The incredible encounter was captured off the coast of Western Australia, near Bremer Bay on January . According to reports, the humpback whale appeared to be tangled in ropes a position which would typically present it as an easy meal for the feared ocean predators. “It would usually be part of their diet so when we saw the injured humpback and the approaching orca, we were concerned,” Whale Watch Western Australiaaposs Gemma Sharp Sharp told the Mandurah Mail.  Onlookers expected the trio of orcas, named Hookfin, Blade and Matriach Queen, to devour the trapped whale.However, they amazingly appeared to lose interest once the humpback was set free, according toDaily Mail reports . “Lting his fluke we could see that this humpback whale was entangled and our hearts sank,” a statement from Whale Watchers Western Australia read.“ a terrible situation to be in when trying to defend yourself against the ocean apex predators.”  However, while the humpback rolled around in the water, the group watched Blade swimming directly under his fluke and looking at the rope entanglement. The orcas then swam towards the humpback, prompting him to defend himself with pectoral fins and fluke swiping. “Matriarch Queen arrived and moved towards the humpback whale which caused a commotion of white water and then something incredible happened,” Whale Watchers Western Australia said.  “A large chunk of the green rope that was entangling the humpback floated free behind him.” The humpback then swam away from the pod of orcas, having been freed in the nick of time. Witnessing a humpback whale swimming in Western Australian waters in January was also unusual. Humpbacks usually feed in Antarctica at this time of year.

By the time the kayak arrived, only the roof of her car was visible above the sub-zero water. According to witnesses who shared videos of the crash on social media, at one point she said: Oh well. I guess Iaposll walk.  Police responded to the scene at .pm, and charged her with dangerous driving.But driving on ice is not actually illegal in the country, where it snows often, the MailOnline reports. Paramedics also attended but the woman refused treatment, according to Canadaaposs National Post newspaper. One Twitter user recalled seeing the woman drive past him at speed and rip by.He added that he wasnapost surprised she ran into trouble on the ice.  A separate video showed the car careening across the frozen river at a high speed. However, this couldaposve been caused by skidding rather than acceleration. In a press release, the Ottawa Police Service said: @This portion of the river has thin ice compared to other areas of the river. This portion of the river has thin ice compared to other areas of the river,apos said the Ottawa Police Service.  Ice conditions at this time of the year can be unpredictable. The Ottawa Police Service would like to remind residents to stay off the ice and remember aposNo Ice is Safe Iceapos. The vehicle remains where it sank in the river. Police have warned it could be a hazard for people curious while wandering around on the ice.

It’s important in cementing a local community together and stopping rural depopulation.“These are definitely exceptional circumstances.

leave his job as a caretaker because the school he worked for had a “knee-jerk” reaction to the post.Keith Waters, , claims his role at the Isle of Ely Primary School in Cambridgeshire, where he was well-known to children and parents, became “untenable” after the comment in June .There were three complaints to the school, where his views were branded “extremist”, “abhorrent” and a “disgusting outburst on a very public ”, but Mr Waters, who has been an evangelical church minister for up to  years, told an employment tribunal that his comments were in line with his conservative Christian beliefs.Mr Waters, from Ely, who is claiming direct and indirect discrimination plus constructive dismissal, believes the school’s investigation of the complaints was flawed because it “applied things that were not to do with the tweet to me”.vw, px\"He told the hearing in Cambridge: “I see that somewere offended. I do not see in the investigation or in the notes that there is any sense that the tweet itself caused an issue.“I believe the way that it was managed by the school caused an issue.“The way the school decided that the easiest and the fastest thing to do would be to slap down my ability to have my rights to live as a Christian, and certainly as a Christian pastor.“I think the school seemed to have a rather knee-jerk reaction. To not have discussed it with me in the first place was rather surprising.”The Twitter post, which coincided with the first Cambridge Pride festival, said: “A reminder that Christians should not support or attend the LGBTQ ‘pride month’ events in June.“They promote a culture and encourage activities that are contrary to Christian faith and morals.“They are especially harmful for children.”Mr Waters worked part-time as a caretaker at the school from January  and resigned in June , just weeks after posting the now-deleted tweet..removeHe said his aim was to warn Christians about LGBTQ Pride events as they may involve nudity, people in sadomasochistic outfits, and displays of an overtly sexual nature.The tribunal heard that the complaints included allegations, which Mr Waters denies, of child molestation, inciting people from other faiths and calling for violence against supporters of the Pride festival.Reaction to the post had included a local Liberal Democrat councillor calling for an apology but “there was not a backlash to the school – there was a backlash to me and around me”, according to Mr Waters.In his witness statement, Mr Waters said he had endured “a campaign of harassment and abuse against me, my family, and my church” after the publicity surrounding his post.This included hate messages sent to his own and the church’s email addresses, undertakers turning up at his home to arrange his funeral, and a visit from estate agents who had been asked to sell his house.Mr Waters handed in his notice and attended a disciplinary hearing that resulted in a final written warning, against which he unsuccessfully appealed.His tweet was branded “anti-LGBTQ” by those who complained to the school who felt it was homophobic, but Mr Waters insisted this was not the case.He told the tribunal: “Sheis saying I can live out my faith but it is curtailed by the school’s policies where they wish it to be curtailed.“The concern is that this is really a subjective thing.”He added that “the problem of having my faith limited by the school’s policies is a big problem, not just for me but for anybody of any faith”.Stephen Peacock, representing the Active Learning Trust which runs the school, told Mr Waters it should be possible to live one’s le and practise one’s faith without circulating harassing, homophobic or discriminatory or offensive material.Mr Waters said he carried out a range of roles at the school, including taking religious lessons and sometimes helping to protect staff from children who were violent.Feeling unable to do his job fully or talk about what was happening to the children or the parents “while all this was going on” made it “impossible” to stay, he said.Deputy headteacher Laura Fielding, who carried out the investigation, described Mr Waters as being “challenging” and unapologetic about his comments or the controversial spotlight it had thrown on the school.The tweet had provoked “signicant” negative publicity, in the local press and online, and the school had to investigate because it had received complaints from parents.Ms Fielding, who said she kept her personal opinion out of the investigation, added: “The LGBTQ community put on these events to celebrate. Criticising these events and saying they are harmful to children was discriminatory against the LGBT community.”Ms Fielding, who accepted that Mr Waters has a right to freedom of speech and religion under the European Court of Human Rights ,  added: “I upheld them.“His beliefs were never in question or asked to be silenced – they just caused the school to go into disrepute.”The hearing was adjourned to Wednesday..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: School had  uknee-jerk u reaction to  uPride harms children u post, tribunal

with some confidence that the rise in cases driven by Omicron peaked in the first week of January and that we are now on the downward slope of this wave of cases”.Ms Sturgeon however stressed there were “still some uncertainties ahead” adding that “throwing all caution to the wind would be a mistake”.The First Minister said: “The full impact of theto work and school after the festive break won’t be apparent yet in the data.“So it is possible that we will see case numbers tick up again in the next couple of weeks.”As a result, she said it “makes sense” for remaining restrictions to be lted on a phased basis.Scottish Tory health spokesman, Dr Sandesh Gulhane, said Ms Sturgeon’s statement “begins a sea change” in Government policy – away from “a rules-based approach, more towards trusting the Scottish public”.But the First Minister rejected Dr Gulhane’s assertion the Government did not go far enough on relieving restrictions after the Tories called for an end to home working and the vaccine passport scheme.“The approach that we are taking – have taken – is balanced, it is appropriately and suitably cautious and it is data-driven and for all these reasons it stands in stark contrast to the approach that the Conservatives have proposed at each and every stage,” she said.The First Minister added: “I continue to be really surprised that Dr Gulhane asks me for evidence of things I think even non-clinically qualied people see as pretty obvious.“When you’re coming out of a wave of this virus, the worst thing to do is to lt all restrictions at exactly the same time and allow all of the mixing and interactions that we have been trying to restrict to happen again all at once.”Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, said “too many businesses are teetering on the brink”, raising the case of more than  staff at two Glasgow theatres who have not been paid in more than a month due to delays in support.Asked what she would do to speed up support, the First Minister said: “As I said last week, we are working with local authorities, with other agencies, to get this moneythe bank accounts of those who need it as quickly as possible.”The First Minister went on to say checks had to be undertaken to guard against fraudulent claims..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sturgeon announces Omicron restrictions to be lted in Scotland

That aside, it was a strong year for the driver.Argyll rally fans are looking forward to a full  season, Covid permitting, in conjunction with Dunfermline Car Club and the new main title sponsors Burnside Piling.CAPTIONS:Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CR MAX.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet.

Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

Some years, the harvest had been better than others, and some trees gave their fruit easier than others. He’d learnt not to expect a good harvest, but hope for one, after caring for the trees in all the ways he’d learnt.But he knew what the problem was. The trees were old. He had pruned them and cared for them in all the ways he knew, but now was the time to plant new treeshe was to enjoy an abundant harvest in future years.But where to plant  He walked about his garden trying to decide the best location.He was a very lucky man, it was an extensive garden and his le’s joy. He knew what was needed, the type of soil, the position so there was enough sunlight, sheltered so the spring buds would be protected from the chill winds. Then he realised the perfect place to create his new orchard: close by the wall at the far end of the garden.He wanted to plant from seeds, and he used the technique his grandfather had taught him so many years ago. So he set to work, first preparing the soil, and then he began planting.The trees would grow up together and help each other to flourish, he thought.Years went by and his new trees did indeed grow. Passers-by would often see him standing admiring their progress.But there were some unkind whisperers in the village, who said mocking things about the old man and his new apple trees.“Does he not realise he will be dead before those trees bear fruit  What a foolish man to waste his time and energy on something he will never enjoy himself. If he had children it might make sense, but he doesn’t.”The unkind whispers of course reached the old man’s ears. But it didn’t stop him standing by the new trees and admiring them, and helping them in the ways he knew, to grow healthily. As each year went by, the new trees got bigger and stronger, but the old man got weaker.Then one spring, he was unable to venture into his garden to admire their blossom. People noticed his absence and they wondered about him.Soon the news was out: he was very ill. One of his neighbours came to see him.They had been le-long friends and every autumn the old man had shared his apples with her, giving her a large basket of them to share with her big family.It was sadly their last meeting, for the old man passed away before the beginning of summer. When autumn arrived, the apple trees he’d planted bore their first fruit. It all seemed so sadly ironic.But then one day during the autumn, the neighbour’s grandchildren came running into her house, looking excited.“Gran, gran, look!” they called out, holding a handful of ripe, juicy-looking apples.“They were lying in your garden, on the grass over there, can we eat them ”She went to look. The old man had planted the new apple trees close to the low-lying wall where they had always had their conversations.It was the place where they had made and maintained their friendship, always talking and catching up.It was at this wall that he would hand over the basket of apples every autumn.Now the apple trees he’d planted had grown tall, and some of the branches arched above her lawn. The trees seemed to be offering her apples.She realised now why he’d planted the seeds there.Then she noticed that some of the trees were growing by the old man’s other wall, which bordered the main road.The old man used to leave a basket of apples by his gate for the children as they were walking to school. Now the trees arched over the grassy verge next to the pavement, displaying their fruit.They were just out of reach, butthe children were inventive and cooperated with each other, they could find ways to pick them.She reached up and picked a ripe-looking apple, just the way he’d taught her all those years ago when they’d first become friends. She looked at it and smiled.She looked over the wall to the place he used to stand when they had their conversations. She would never see him standing there again, she thought, never have those conversations again.But then she looked at the apple she had picked and smiled. Her sadness lted and she looked at the trees.“You’re still here,” she said quietly to the rustling branches, “and you’re still sharing your apples with everyone.”"},{"url":null,"title":"horrendous-ugly-fencing-gets-go-ahead-school","story":"Haddington’s community council had reacted angrily to proposals for metal fencing, measuring . metres in

North Berwick Youth Project started an online cookery group to keep youngsters entertained and educated.Previously, a cooking class took place at the town’s Hope Rooms, which young people attended weekly to choose a dish, go to the shops to buy ingredients, cook the meal and eat it together.Recipes include nachos and truffles Once a month, a group of older people from the community would join the session for an intergenerational meet and eat.Now, the youth project carries out a class online, where one young person takes the role of head chef and demonstrates how to make their chosen dish – ingredients are delivered to the chef’s home by staff from the youth project, which received funding from Tesco Community Grants to do so.Beth Smith, lead youth worker, said: “Not only have the young people learned new recipes but they have also grown in confidence and fed their families.“We had been posting the dishes on Facebook and had quite a few comments from teachers at North Berwick High School and people in the community saying they’d love to see us create a recipe book.“We had previously tried to gather recipes and had the intention of creating the book before summer but we were extremely busy and never got round to chasing it up.”But last November, David and Judith Booth, of local firm Booth Creative, were contacted to assist the project after designing the youth group’s new

recipes.“Within a few days, Booth Creative had put together a mock recipe book, which we were so impressed with.”The cookbooks were printed a week later and ready to sell.The book features five

Remember,you are not an experienced winter swimmer, that the water is coldest at this time of year, and it might be better to hold off till late spring, or at least keep it short and swim with someone experienced. Groups are usually findable on social media.: Why so many men are joining the wild swimming crazePortobello, EdinburghHome to a huge and very active wild swimming community in the form of the Wild Ones, but also to an increasing number of separate groups, like The Edinburgh Blue Balls, a men’s mental health group which is now drawing large crowds for regular swims. This town beach has plenty of cafes at which to get a warming coffee afterwards too, and also the Green Van, which often has snaking queues of swimmers trailing up to it. As local swimmer, Alex Sehgal told us, “Porty, as it’s affectionately called isn’t the most spectacular beach, but it wins the hearts of all who swim there.” Tidal pools, FeSt Monans, Pittenweem, Cellardyke… The tidal pools along the Fe coastline were once busy, bustling, resort pools, but over the late th century had been allowed to fall into disrepair. Now, vibrant communities are restoring them to regular use - and forming regular swim groups around them and the local Fe beaches, including for instance, Fe Dippers Mens Mental Health Dipping Society. Anna Deacon describes Pittenweem Tidal Pool: “Recently redeveloped by the community group West Brais Project, it has been restored to its former glory and is a wonderful spot to enjoy the beautul coastline which is known for being a leading whale and dolphin spotting location.” Loch Lubnaig, The TrossachsThere’s something about the accessibility of Loch Lubnaig, just a pull off the A, driving north through the Trossachs that has made it a draw and means that on any weekend there is almost always a group of swimmers dipping there. Often groups from Edinburgh and Glasgow make it a destination not too far from the city, but surrounded by peaks. It’s also where we met the incredible Jacky Morrison-Hart,  now sadly lost to Covid, who had only  percent vision and was enabled to swim there by her we, Jane, and friends. Local swimmer Barry McGowan advises, “Post swim cakes at the Cabin Cafe, which also has toilet facilities, close to the water’s edge at the middle paying carpark.” Aberdeen BeachAberdeen has an incredible beach nearly two miles long, but it’s the Footdeebeach, which backs onto the old fishing village, which really draws a swimming community. Local Kieran Moroney writes, “The little cottages and outbuildings look like something out of a fairytale. If you get up early enough the sunrises coming up over the horizon can be magical and you are often greeted with dolphins”. Highly recommended for post-swim refreshments is the Roots vegan food truck on the beach. Loch Morlich, The CairngormsWhere the Cairngorm Wild Swimmers meet every Sunday, this loch even has its own sandy beach and plenty of parking. Even in the deaths of winter, with snow swirling around, we have found hardcore groups of swimmers down there. Local swimmer Alison Freshwater writes, “Loch Morlich lies in the shadow of the majestic Cairngorms, with the ski resort rising directly up from the beautul Glenmore forest which surrounds it.,, Entry to the beach is over clean, soft sand. You could be forgiven for thinking you are in a seaside resort and not freshwater.”Subscribe now for the latest arts TV nostalgia features environmental news and opinion letters from just £ by clicking here The Art of Wild Swimming Scotland by Anna Deacon and Vicky Allan is published by Black and White "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/ 13381943.jpg?type=article-full","title":"many-men-joining-wild-swimming-craze","story":"But then this is no ordinary swim group. This is the Edinburgh Blue Balls, a men’s mental health swim group.Among those taking part in that pre-swim “check-in” is actor Johnny Panchaud who recalls his very first such circle, vividly, ashe were still there.“We’re all standing on the sand, all these men of dferent shapes, sizes, ages. We’re all nervous about swimming. And Marc, the founder of the group, just says, ‘We’re going to do a check-in today.’ Everyone was like, what the hell’s a check-in  Normally getting in the water is the scary part.“So we’re standing in a circle, and even that’s scary, men getting in a circle, and we start telling each other how we’re feeling and what we’re struggling with. And these words like anxiety, depression, fear, that people always experience but, especially, men never share, start coming out.”Edinburgh Blue Balls swimmer Johnny Panchaud,Marc MillarAlso in attendance at some of those early swim check-ins was keen rugby player John McMillan.“As we went round,” he says, “everyone was sharing their fears and anxieties and you could see that, as it progressed, people’s chests were getting bigger, almost getting strength from the group itself.“McMillan had found the group at a time of need, spotting it on Facebook in the run up to the fth anniversary of the day he tried to take his le.“Because I knew the anniversary was approaching,” he says, “things were building up. I knew either I was going to have a total breakdown or I needed to do something. Coming across this group was a huge weight off my shoulders. I was able to not bottle it up as much.”John McMillan,Marc MillarThe Instagram strapline for the Edinburgh Blue Balls is “weekly swim group to give men the chance to improve mental and physical health”.As the group has got bigger and the weather colder, they now no longer do a physical check-in before swimming and have replaced it with an online chat group. Issues discussed there include alcoholism, abusive relationships, attempted suicides, bereavement, depression, anxiety.Of course, long before men discovered group wild swimming and got the t-shirt , women were there.With my collaborator Anna Deacon, I’ve been writing books about wild swimming for some years now . At book events, people would sometimes ask us, why it was wild swimmers were mainly women  Why was it all blue tits and no blue balls But the pandemic has expanded the demographic coming to the water. With lockdowns and restrictions leaving many of us cooped up and isolated, more have been drawn to the great escape of getting into a cold sea.: The ice breakers. How Scotlands ice swimmers taught me to love the cold.The past couple of years have taken a toll on our collective mental health. Deaths from alcohol, in , were up almost  percent on the previous year and twice as many men as women died as a result of alcohol.Depression levels have doubled during the pandemic. It’s against this backdrop that an outdoor swimming for mental health trend has emerged.Particularly powerful has been the UK-wide Mental Health Swims movement founded by Rachel Ashe.Meanwhile, this new wave of men’s groups, swimming explicitly for mental health, has arrived with names like Edinburgh Blue Balls, the Sunrise Club, Blue Balls Cornwall, Ice Guys North East and Fe Dippers Mental Health Men’s Dip.It’s December  when I meet Marc Millar for a chat at Bross Bagels, which he runs with his partner in Portobello. The -year-old sports the same broad beard that lunges out of the logo created by a friend for the group’s social media. That graphic is also emblazoned across ious bits of entertaining group merchandise, including a hoodie, and their Edinburgh Blue Balls budgie smugglers. A set of blue balls, naturally, also feature in the entertainingly tongue-in-cheek image. Millar is himself a professional photographer, who has taken images accompanying this article.Edinburgh Blue Balls swimming at Wardie Bay,Anna DeaconHe describes how he had been following the Instagram account of Ice Guys North East, who swim from Roker Beach, Sunderland.When he askedthey might start a group in Edinburgh, their reply was to encourage him to set it up himself. “So I had a couple of bottles of wine one night and did it. Before I knew it ten people were coming the next day.”The group snowballed. “It’s a bunch of guys,” Marc says, “with absolutely nothing in common, all dferent ages, walks of le. Before a swim, everyone’s polite. But then you dip your balls in the water and you’ve got everything in common, everything. You feel so much empathy.”One of the main issues, he observes, for a lot of the members is anxiety. “Also abusive relationships. And a lot of the guys are open about how they’ve tried to commit suicide as well. ”What’s clear, from speaking to many other swimmers, is that Millar’s willingness to express his anxieties is part of its success. He’s not only leading them into the water, but into a particular way of talking about themselves.As Johnny Panchaud puts it, “He got everyone’s trust so quickly and I think that came through him being extremely transparent. For the first month he was saying, saying, ‘Guys I’m s***ing myself, I’m still terried before every single group.’ The leader of the group showing vulnerability has encouraged us to show vulnerability.”Edinburgh Blue Balls at Portobello beach,Marc MillarPanchaud shows his own vulnerability as he relates the journey that led him to being now -months sober.Back in October , he had hit a low, and whilst visiting his parent’s house when they were were away, he found himself alone with his own dark thoughts.“I’m not going to say that I was thinking about committing suicide, because I don’t think I would ever have had the bottle to see that through. But the thought had entered my mind for the first time: ‘How do I get out of this ”He called an old friend in London who flew up “at the drop of a hat” and after much soul-searching, he made a pledge to himself: he would stop drinking and taking recreational drugs. Five days later, he took up an offer from friends to go for a “wild water swim” at Portobello. In the run up he found himself genuinely losing sleep over the imminent dip.“But we did it. I must have been in and out in two minutes. But after that, I went religiously, every single day for one month.”In that early stage, he says, he was not “ready to look back at the trail of destruction I’d caused with my drinking and drugs”, or forward.“I felt I’ve got to find a way of staying sober today. And with wild swimming, you physically can’t think about anything other than now.”Amongst the group, he is not alone in his openness about dark times. David Nimmons, for instance, describes how prior to this he was driven to seek help from his doctor by his suicidal thoughts, and the attempted suicide of his brother.“My marriage had ended. I was trying to make sense of everything, including my brother’s attempted suicide. I had started speaking to a talking therapist through the NHS which helped massively but I needed something . I needed something to help me control it on my own terms.”A reason swimming appealed was, he says, because his brother had attempted suicide by jumping off rocks into a river.“For my brother, the idea was that this cold water was going to take him away. But for me the water gives me strength. No matter what day I’ve had, once I’m in the water with the guys it’s like le is beautul.”The circle,Anna DeaconIt’s hugely moving to hear these men’s stories, told with hearts on sleeves.Stuart Kennedy, for instance, describes the rollercoaster last few years of his le, in which his best friend died in a car accident, he split up with his we and began a long stint of living with parents and friends, during the pandemic and then, just as he had started to feel that le was getting back to normal, his ex-we was diagnosed with cervical cancer.That cancer, sadly, would take her le, and leave Kennedy supporting his two young sons through the loss of their mother.Then there’s Ryan Malone, who recalls,“Lockdown hit me pretty badly. But this has always been underlying. I’m . I’ve been speaking to a few people about why men in that age bracket are in such a bad state of mental health. For me, it was just a build up of anxiety and depression.“It built up to one Sunday in August, when my we was in London and I was on my own. I couldn’t breathe. I’d had anxiety and minor panic attacks before but with this I realised I needed to seek help. I went to the GP that Monday.”Ryan Malone,Marc MillarMalone mentions the mid-le crisis, which also something also broached by Mental Health Swims coach Salim Ahmed. The founder of SwimLab, Ahmed teaches swimming as an art, rather than competitive skill.Men are, he observes, becoming more aware that there are several stages to the ‘midle crisis’.“There’s the accelerated way in which your body starts to fail having to let go of your personal best and learning that you need to accept certain things are happening with your physiology.“Men are becoming aware of that. They’re starting to discover that just having a swim every couple of days is making them feel so much better. And then they find that they’re getting their mojo back. But they have to embrace the fact that they have to approach swimming in a dferent way. Not to win, but to live.”But is it even about swimming  It seems to me the male mental health swim trend is part of a wider men’s mental health movement that’s expressed in multiple ways.Marc Millar observes: “It’s not actually about swimming or dipping. It’s just a mutual thing where everyone is doing the same thing at the same time.”Edinburgh Blue Balls,Marc MillarIt’s January , . A large, woolly-hatted flock of around  men mill around the groyne that leads down to the water at Portobello beach and are are joined by visiting swimmers Jonathan Cowie, editor of Outdoor Swimmer magazine and, of all things, a woman, Gilly McArthur, sporting a fake beard.As the crowd moves towards the water, wading in what looks like some kind of communal baptism, there’s a flurry of grunts and out-breaths.But there are no signs of competition here – just what looks like pure, joyful swimming to live.Cowie and McArthur are here as part of a month of swims with men, their intention being “to expand out the message that cold water can be helpful and powerful for men as well as women.”:  Scottish wild swim spots with amazing communitiesEmerging from the water, McArthur, comments on how she felt a touch of intimidation going in with so many men. It’s the mirror to something Millar expresses.A resident of Portobello, he had watched groups of mainly women getting into the water there, and felt uncomfortable as a man with joining.“I never would see any guys.

It is perhaps the only area in which the Global Britain boast actually holds true, and yet the right-wing of the Tory Party would destroy it to secure their dream of a Singapore on Thames.There is not much to be proud of in the UK as far as I am concerned, but the BBC is certainly one, and I can put up with any amount of celebrity-come-cake-cooking while singing and dancing on ice, as long as I can have David Attenborough, Professor Brian Cox and Jim Al-Khalili from time to time.John Jamieson, Ayr.* AS a supporter of self-government for Scotland, I regard the BBC with many reservations. The BBC has never allocated to Scotland its proper quota of funding, and it is obviously not neutral on the question of independence. Nevertheless I am in favour of a Scottish public service broadcaster, separated from government and regulated by proper standards of ethical journalism.I have some sympathy for the employees of Pacic Quay, who appear to have little or no autonomy. That the Tories dislike the BBC is obvious, and a “Fox News”-type clone would be more to their liking. The Labour Party also had a very close relationship with Rupert Murdoch, so the future of public service broadcasting,left to these two parties, looks bleak.GR Weir, Ochiltree.TORIES DESERVE BORIS JOHNSONI WAS struck by the letter from T J Dowdsstating that it is “unfair” to condemn so-called “decent Tories” who voted to make Boris Johnson Prime Minister. There is a famous saying which notes “fool me once, shame on you fool me twice, shame on me”.Those Tory supporters who backed the Conservatives at the last General Election were well aware of his character as being a liar and a philanderer, well before “partygate”. However, they were still more than happy to support him at the ballot box. Leopards don’t change their spots so, like Donald Trump, one wonders what these iniduals somehow expected to happen when he was in Downing Street Mr Johnson has been sacked from a newspaper for lying in an article he wrote and as a Conservative shadow minister for lying about an affair. This is only the tip of the iceberg, and his public and private le is littered with a litany of lies he has told, all very well documented. Yet, despite this, he was elected as leader of the Conservative Party and ultimately as Prime Minister with a not-inconsiderable majority.It is oft quoted that “the government you elect is the government you deserve”. Those complicit in elevating Mr Johnson to the role as Prime Minister of the UK, well aware of his character, may want to take some time to pause and reflect on whether this is truly the outcome they wanted. For those in Scotland the simple question I pose is: “is this really the best we can do ”Alex Orr, Edinburgh.PM NEEDS TO SHOW SHAMEWHEN it comes to the record of an inidual as slippery as Boris Johnson, I am afraid that “sorry” doesn’t mend it.Mr Johnson needs to demonstrate unequivocally that he is ashamed. Ashamed of telling lies to the British peopleashamed at evading the truth whenever this is uncomfortable for him and ashamed at the damage he has done to this country, not least over cynically entering into an international agreement on the Irish Protocol, and which he knew from the start was unworkable – simply to “get Brexit done”. A classic case, like everything , of contemptuously cutting the Gordian knot.Only by properly acknowledging guilt and by making amends,this is now even possible, can he be forgiven and escape being deservedly renowned as the worst prime minister in living, and possibly national, memory.Robert Bell, Cambuslang.TIME FOR A NEW LEADERI WAS not keen on Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister. I voted not to leave Europe. I am a lelong unionist and, in , voted for Scotland to remain in the Union. I have also continued, like many of us in Scotland, to stand up for Mr Johnson over the past couple of years as our elected leader, despite his obvious faults.Douglas Ross decided last week to call him out. He did so because it is patently obvious to most of us up here that having Mr Johnson in charge will make winning another referendum in the near future almost impossible, especially with people like Jacob Rees-Mogg making derisory comments about Mr Ross.I feel that Mr Ross made the wrong call in going public on his wish to see Mr Johnson go, but the response from Mr Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the House, demonstrates extremely poor judgment at such a critical time for the Union. Although it will not affect how I vote in another referendum, there are tens of thousands of fellow Scots who have had enough of the shenanigans of Mr Johnson and his entourage and will veer towards voting to leave. The time is right now for a new leader.WM Allan, Stonehaven.BLAME SUNAK FOR COUNCIL WOESWHAT a nerve Miles Briggs and other Tories have on council funding , as it is Rishi Sunak’s UK Budget that is cutting the Scottish Government’s funding by . per cent compared to -, as confirmed by the Scottish Fiscal Commission, yet local authorities are receiving a cash increase of £ million although this is largely negated by escalating inflation caused by the UK Government’s failures on Brexit, soaring energy prices and its disastrous handling of Covid.Even with higher bills, Scottish council tax payers will remain much better off than in England or under Labour-run Wales. In Scotland the average Band D council tax bill is currently £ lower than in England and £ lower than Wales. Also, the average water bill is £ lower in Scotland and the income tax bill for median-waged employees is £ lower in Scotland under our more progressive system.Those who think that Mr Sunak will revive the fortunes of the Union are sadly deluded he broke the Tory promise on the triple lock for state pensions that will deprive our elderly citizens of £ in  while hiking National Insurance contributions for employers and employees, plus increasing our income tax bills through stealth by not increasing allowances in line with inflation.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.FRANCE SHOWS THE WAY ON ENERGYFRENCH President Emmaneul Macron just ordered EDF, the state energy company, to cap electricity prices to shield consumers. He can do this because the state owns  per cent of the shares in the company that supplies the majority of power to French consumers.Contrast that with the UK, where since the s the Government has sold off our energy resourcesto private companies. EDF is one of the foreign companies that bought a chunk and now owns more than % of UK electricity production. Another % is owned by German, Spanish and Dutch companies. Privatisation of our national assets has been a colossal failure for consumers and the environment, but a huge boon to private shareholders and company CEOs.As a result, UK consumers are looking at increases of % once the price cap is lted in April. Ofgem, the energy regulator, must by law pass on rising costs to consumers.This will be especially painful for Scottish consumers. We already pay the highest transmission charges in the UK while England and Wales get a subsidy. Plus, Scottish gas production is % of total UK production. And we’re just eight per cent of the population. What would this gas be worthScotland had control over its own energy resources  At least £. billion, the sales value of Scottish oil and gas production in .And London tells us we’re too wee and poor to go it alone.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.Read more: Lets lance the Indy boil with a fully informed vote"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-djokovic-not-hard-done-blame-kicked-australia","story":"It seems very clear that Djokovic had already committed two signicant and serious offences: first, he appeared in public and mixed freely with many people, including children, in the days following his positive Covid test. Secondly, he made a  statement on his visa application form . This latter misdemeanour is in itself sufficient grounds for any country to refuse entry, particularly in the midst of a global pandemic.Nick Mackay, Stirling.* FIRST, may I congratulate Kevin McKenna on yet again writing a strong, thought-provoking article. As usual, I both agree and disagree with some of his points.It’s not the main in point of my letter, but I do not agree with his statement that Djokovic is being held responsible for all future outbreaks of civil disobedience by anti-vax campaigners. Less is more, Mr McKenna.No, what I take umbrage with this time is his reference to roughshod and shoddy. Roughshod refers to horseshoes with nails or similar driven through them for grip, not their appearance.

Of all head of state options available, including some kind of political presidency, I thought a constitutional monarchy the best choice available. Then, when I took early retirement from working offshore some years ago and became involved in dealing with overseas tourists, I began to see the huge economic benefits.Most of the many foreign tourists with whom I spoke were fascinated by the royal family and in fact knew more about them and their way of le and where they lived than I did and visits to royal sites were top of the agenda. It was a kind of Hollywood stardom. It opened my eyes to their value to this country. Perhaps the institution itself is outdated, but there are many pluses.I find it most sad, therefore, to see Prince Andrew and his nephew, Prince Harry, bringing the whole institution into disrepute. It is time I believe for both to disappear from public le permanently before any more damage is done.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.BIBLE LESSON FOR THE DUKEIAN Thomsonwonders what The Queen makes of the Duke of Yorks behaviour and its consequences.I well remember, at school, during a particularly rumbustious period our teacher calling us to order and told us to read Proverbs chapter  verse , when we got home.It is a pity that Andrew, spoilt child of The Queen, was never apparently made aware of the passage concerned: \"A wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.\"Perhaps he wouldnt have cared anyway.David Hay, Minard.KIRK SHOULD LET GO OF PRIVILEGEIN response to plummeting congregation numbers and growing financial debt, the Church of Scotland is considering mergers, staff cuts and the handing over of St Giles’ Cathedral to Historic Environment Scotland, the state-funded heritage .There is no schadenfreude for the Edinburgh Secular Society in this development: these historical buildings are important to all Scots, including the small group who use them for religious worship.However, with even religious architecture coming into state ownership we must surely now let go of any vestigial notion that the Kirk speaks for all with its privileged position in education, law and government.Neil Barber, Edinburgh Secular Society.VOTE AGAINST THE PARKING LEVYTHE Scottish Government is ramping up its war on motorists. Councils will be given the power to introduce a workplace parking levy from March , . Nottingham is the only city in the UK imposing this levy and charges an annual £ per space. Many businesses have passed this cost on to the employees who use the spaces.Scottish Transport Minister Graeme Dey, who is behind this draconian decision, has said: \"Scotland needs to take world-leading bold action to tackle the climate emergency.\" This is laughable since Scotland is responsible for only . per cent of global emissions. Scotland has . million cars but there are . billion in the world.

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC.

We’ve gone with Dan. He brings that experience.“I think itwill add to Dan’s game.“It is well-documented that Dan is a highly-motivated player, he is very competitive and he speaks his mind. We don’t want to change him as a competitive player.“We want him to take on the role as a captain and the duties that go with that with referees.” vw,vw,px, px\"Wales and Dragons flanker Ross Moriarty The squad includes three uncapped players in hooker Dewi Lake, his Ospreys colleague Jac Morgan and Cardf number eight James Ratti.Flanker Ross Moriarty, who has not played since the autumn due to a shoulder problem, makes the group and is on course to feature for his regional team the Dragons a week before Wales’ February  Six Nations opener against Ireland in Dublin.Pivac added: “We are in close contact with the clubs and their medical teams. Ross is on track to play, not this weekend as the Dragons don’t play, but the following weekend.“He will be released from camp to get a game under his belt, andhe comes through that then obviously he will be available for selection for Ireland.”Wales have announced their  squad for the #GuinnessSixNations 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 pic BEcgwR— Guinness Six NationsJanuary , Jones, meanwhile, has undergone two shoulder operations since being hurt during Wales’ Autumn Nations Series opener against New Zealand in October.Hooker Owens has a back problem, Tipuric and Navidi have shoulder issues, North and Halfpenny are recovering from knee injuries and Faletau has not played this season because of ankle trouble.When injuries are added to a number of coronavirus-related cancellations and postponements – the four Welsh regions have only played  games between them in eight weeks – it has been far from a straightforward Six Nations build-up.“Preparing this squad is going to be the most challenging for us to date. Just selecting the squad was an interesting exercise,” Pivac said.Wayne Pivacs thoughts on his squad selection ahead of the  @sixnationsrugby.❝Its a very exciting competition, and were very privileged that we were able to win it last year❞ pic cmyMkBqA— Welsh Rugby Union 🏉January , “It is well-documented with the Covid cases in clubs and being stuck in South Africa , it hasn’t been ideal for a lot of players.“I know they’ve been doing a lot of hard work behind the scenes, and we will be doing our best over the first few weeks to put as much volume into them as we can without breaking them.“It’s a fine balance. We have got to get them up to playing Test rugby, and we know that takes a bit of work.“Those players, through no fault of their own, have been put in that situation. So it is working together with the clubs, making sure we’ve got the right information about them in terms of the selection we have made, and we will see where we go from there.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They include having a one-metre social distancing gap between guests and events limited to  people standing indoors and  people sitting indoors. However, there are no limits on the numbers of people attending outdoor events.Scots also need to have a booster to be considered to be fully vaccinated – and only have a window of four months to get it after their second dose to be fully vaccinated.– What is changing from next week Ms Sturgeon has announced that nightclub closures and the requirement for table service in hospitality will come to an end.Attendance limits on indoor events and the guidance asking people to stick to a three-household limit on indoor gatherings will also be lted.However, some baseline coronavirus measures which were in place before the Omicron wave will remain.This includes wearing face coverings in public indoor settings and on public transport, as well as working from home whenever it is possible. vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson – What are the rules in England The Prime Minister seems set to end England’s coronavirus measures when their expiry date comes up next week.Indeed, on Tuesday Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he is “cautiously optimistic” that the Government can “substantially reduce” the restrictions.Sajid Javid told MPs it was likely “we have already reached the peak of the case numbers of hospitalisations”.Currently, face coverings are compulsory in most indoor public settings, as well as on public transport, and people have been told to work from homethey can.Secondary school pupils also must wear masks in classrooms.Covid passes are still required for entry into nightclubs and other venues, a rule which has been in place since December .If a person in England has tested positive or has symptoms, they can stop self-isolating after seven days instead of they receive two negative lateral flow test results on days six and seven.Those who are unvaccinated close contacts of positive cases must still isolate for  days.New rules have recently come into force for fully vaccinated travellers as well. They are required to take a lateral flow test, rather than a PCR, no later than the end of day two after their arrival.It is unclear what measures,any, will remain in place after next week. vw,vw,px, px\"First Minister Mark Drakeford – What are the rules in Wales Groups of no more than six people are allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants.Licensed premises can offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected, and two-metre social distancing rules are in place.Nightclubs have been closed since Boxing Day and there is a requirement to work from home wherever possible.Currently, a maximum of  people can attend indoor events and a maximum of  people are allowed at outdoor events.People attending weddings or civil partnership receptions or wakes are also being told to take a lateral flow test before attending.The mandatory isolation period for people who test positive with Covid- is seven, subject to two negative lateral flow tests on days six and seven.And similarly to England, confirmatory PCR tests for asymptomatic people who test positive on a lateral flow device are no longer needed.Rules around travelling are also similar to England, with fully vaccinated travellers needing to take a lateral flow teston day two and,positive, a follow-up PCR test to enable genomic sequencing to be carried out.A pre-departure test and a day two PCR test when arriving in the UK is no longer needed for fully vaccinated travellers.– What is changing from Friday From Friday of this week, Wales will begin a phased lting of restrictions.There will be no limits on the numbers of people able to attend outdoor events and outdoor hospitality will be able to operate without table service.Then from Friday January  attendance limits from indoor events will be lted, including nightclubs, cinemas, and theatres. However, Covid passes will be needed for larger events. The rule of six and working from home will also be lted.Although employers must show that they are taking reasonable measures to limit the spread of coronavirus.Some baseline measures will remain in place, including wearing face coverings on public transport, and in public indoor settings, as well as self-isolating after travelling from abroad.– What about Northern Ireland Nightclubs in Northern Ireland are closed and dancing has been prohibited in hospitality venues.But the rule does not apply to weddings.People must remain seated for table service while table numbers are limited to six and two-metre social distancing rules are in place in all businesses.The self-isolation period for confirmed Covid- cases in Northern Ireland is also seven days, subject to negative lateral flow tests on days six and seven.Northern Irish ministers have also agreed that sporting events can continue with no limits on capacity, while the work-from-home message is being bolstered and legislation introduced to require social distancing in offices and similar workplaces.The guidance for mixing in a domestic setting is limited to three households.Face masks must be worn in shops, indoor-seated venues and visitor attractions, public transport and some other settings.

I do not see in the investigation or in the notes that there is any sense that the tweet itself caused an issue.“I believe the way that it was managed by the school caused an issue.“The way the school decided that the easiest and the fastest thing to do would be to slap down my ability to have my rights to live as a Christian, and certainly as a Christian pastor.“I think the school seemed to have a rather knee-jerk reaction. To not have discussed it with me in the first place was rather surprising.”The Twitter post, which coincided with the first Cambridge Pride festival, said: “A reminder that Christians should not support or attend the LGBTQ ‘pride month’ events in June.“They promote a culture and encourage activities that are contrary to Christian faith and morals.“They are especially harmful for children.”Mr Waters worked part-time as a caretaker at the school from January  and resigned in June , just weeks after posting the now-deleted tweet.He said his aim was to warn Christians about LGBTQ Pride events as they may involve nudity, people in sadomasochistic outfits, and displays of an overtly sexual nature.The tribunal heard that the complaints included allegations, which Mr Waters denies, of child molestation, inciting people from other faiths and calling for violence against supporters of the Pride festival.Reaction to the post had included a local Liberal Democrat councillor calling for an apology but “there was not a backlash to the school – there was a backlash to me and around me”, according to Mr Waters.In his witness statement, Mr Waters said he had endured “a campaign of harassment and abuse against me, my family, and my church” after the publicity surrounding his post.This included hate messages sent to his own and the church’s email addresses, undertakers turning up at his home to arrange his funeral, and a visit from estate agents who had been asked to sell his house.Mr Waters handed in his notice and attended a disciplinary hearing that resulted in a final written warning, against which he unsuccessfully appealed.His tweet was branded “anti-LGBTQ” by those who complained to the school who felt it was homophobic, but Mr Waters insisted this was not the case.He told the tribunal: “Sheis saying I can live out my faith but it is curtailed by the school’s policies where they wish it to be curtailed.“The concern is that this is really a subjective thing.”He added that “the problem of having my faith limited by the school’s policies is a big problem, not just for me but for anybody of any faith”.Stephen Peacock, representing the Active Learning Trust which runs the school, told Mr Waters it should be possible to live one’s le and practise one’s faith without circulating harassing, homophobic or discriminatory or offensive material.Mr Waters said he carried out a range of roles at the school, including taking religious lessons and sometimes helping to protect staff from children who were violent.Feeling unable to do his job fully or talk about what was happening to the children or the parents “while all this was going on” made it “impossible” to stay, he said.Deputy headteacher Laura Fielding, who carried out the investigation, described Mr Waters as being “challenging” and unapologetic about his comments or the controversial spotlight it had thrown on the school.The tweet had provoked “signicant” negative publicity, in the local press and online, and the school had to investigate because it had received complaints from parents.Ms Fielding, who said she kept her personal opinion out of the investigation, added: “The LGBTQ community put on these events to celebrate. Criticising these events and saying they are harmful to children was discriminatory against the LGBT community.”Ms Fielding, who accepted that Mr Waters has a right to freedom of speech and religion under the European Court of Human Rights ,  added: “I upheld them.“His beliefs were never in question or asked to be silenced – they just caused the school to go into disrepute.”The hearing was adjourned to Wednesday.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

Photo: Padraig O#Reilly.Aodhan O#FaolainJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe High Court in the Republic of Ireland has lted an order preventing the naming of the ringleader in the kidnapping and serious injury of businessman Kevin Lunney.The man is Alan Harte , who last month was sentenced to  years in prison by the non-jury Special Criminal Courtfor committing serious harm on and ly imprisoning the Quinn Industrial Holdingsdirector in .The order was lted on Tuesday by Mr Justice Charles Meenan who dismissed an application by Mr Harte#s lawyers to further extend Harte#s anonymity.Read MoreAppeals lodged by trio jailed for kidnap and torture of Kevin LunneyThe DPP had argued Mr Harte should be named.Citing Article  of the Irish Constitution, which states that justice must be administered in public the judge said he could see no basis for continuing the order.The judge also said that legal safeguards remain available to Mr Harte regarding any prejudice he claims he will suffer due to any publicity arising from his trial and conviction by the SCC.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up During his trial Harte was referred to as #YZ#. When handing down the sentence Mr Justice Tony Hunt at the SCC described Harte as the ringleader and the person who had inflicted most of the injuries on Mr Lunney.Two other men involved in the businessman#s kidnapping and assault, Alan O#Brien , of Shelmalier Road, and Darren Redmond , from Caledon Road, both East Wall, Dublin, were also given y prison sentences by the SCC.The anonymity order, which had initially been granted by the SCC, had been extended by the High Court in December.The order had been put in place when Harte, with an address at Island Quay Apartments, East Wall, was first before the courts in connection with the offences.It was granted because he had been due to go on trial before the Central Criminal Court in relation to an unrelated charge of murder.That trial collapsed and the charge against Harte was dismissed, after the DPP entered a nolle prosequi in the case.However, the order was continued, on a temporary basis after his conviction by SCC.This was done to protect the man#s rights to a fair trial as he has other unrelated criminal matters pending before the criminal courts.Following his conviction, Harte#s lawyers claimed that his naming by the media in reports could prejudice his rights to a fair trial before a judge and jury.Arising out of those concerns Harte launched High Court judicial review proceedings against the DPP and the SCC seeking orders including a temporary order extending his anonymity.The anonymity order was continued until Tuesday#s sitting of the High Court.On Tuesday Harte#s lawyers had asked the court to continue the order, arguing that there was a possibility that some of the criminal matters may be heard within the six month period.He sought an extension until February when one of the cases against him was due to be mentioned before the courts.Michael Hourigan BL for Harte said that there was a prospect that some of the criminal matters could be heard within the next six months.It was argued that a fade factor of about six months, between the time a person is sentenced to when they go before a judge and jury in other courts, was required.The application to further continue the order was opposed by the DPP, represented by Sean Guerin SC.Counsel said that there was little or no chance of the pending matters being heard within the next six months.There was therefore no reason why the man should not now be named counsel said.What was a spurious unfounded and articial arrangement should now be removed, he said.Counsel said that the continuation of the order was being sought as part of an attempt by Harte to continue to prevent his name from being published for quite some time.In his ruling, Mr Justice Meenan said that it was part of the criminal process that those convicted of offences be named, bar in certain exceptional circumstances.Harte#s case did not come under one of those exceptions, and the judge said that there was no reason to continue the order.He said that Harte could make any application he needs to the courts to have safeguards put in place to prevent him suffering any prejudice in any forthcoming trial.Related topicsKevin LunneyMore On Kevin Lunney PremiumLunney firm fears TV show about Sean Quinn could escalate campaign against them PremiumNet closing on the paymasters behind Kevin Lunney kidnap terrorKevin Lunney’s torturers get  years jail time PremiumKevin Lunney: ‘I don’t know why they did it...

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePaul Givan and Robbie Butler MLA during the vigil.Claire McNeillyTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFirst Minister Paul Givan has not joined the Presbyterian Church, according to the DUP.Mr Givan, who resigned from the Free Presbyterian Church late last year, was pictured at a vigil for murdered Co Offaly woman Asling Murphy at First Lisburn Presbyterian Church on Sunday evening.His appearance at the event, which was organised by Alliance MLA Sorcha Eastwood, gave rise to speculation that Mr Givan had joined the church.But a DUP spokesman told the Belfastthat Mr Givan was just in attendance as a local MLA.Although the First Minister parted company with the Free Presbyterian Church in November , he has never officially confirmed his resignation.A retired leading minister from the church that the late DUP leader Ian Paisley founded claimed at the time that he had been made aware that the Lagan Valley Assembly man had left following a dispute over his attendance at the cross-community Northern Ireland centenary service in Armagh.Rev Ivan Foster, a one-time prominent member of the DUP, said Mr Givan had tendered his resignation after speaking to Free Presbyterian Church elders in Lisburn.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Givan had been criticised by church members for his attendance at the ecumenical service last October.When approached about the resignation, he would neither confirm nor deny it had happened, adding that it was “an issue that I don’t intend to make public commentary about”.At the time, the DUP said the matter of Mr Givan’s religion was a private one for him.In an interview with BBC Radio Ulster last year, Mr Givan said: “This is, for me, an issue where first and foremost, I regard the Gospel as being of fundamental importance.“My own personal circumstances are secondary to that.“I would never want to say anything in a public way that would diminish that Gospel witness.”Mr Givan has stood by his decision to attend the centenary event.“When the invitation came in it was obviously something I considered, and I took the view that it was appropriate for me, as First Minister, to attend,” he said.Mr Givan’s resignation means that there are now fewer than  DUP MLAs who call themselves Free Presbyterians.Although the church and Northern Ireland’s biggest political party were never officially linked, most of the early DUP members were from a Free Presbyterian backgroundIn recent years, however, the two bodies have grown apart.The first major schism came when Mr Paisley opted to become Northern Ireland First Minister and enter a devolved government with Sinn Fein.The church handed Rev Paisley an ultimatum of either renouncing his position as First Minister or quitting his role as moderator, which he had held for  years.Rev Paisley chose politics and served as First Minister alongside the late Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein as Deputy First Minister.The Free Presbyterian Church was also highly critical of the DUP’s choice of Alison Bennington, a lesbian, as an Antrim and Newtownabbey council candidate, in .In a statement about Ms Bennington, the church said that it “underlines its opposition to all martial and sexual relationships outside the covenant of Biblical marriage”.It added: “Therefore, as a church, we are saddened by the attempts of political parties to normalise and promote marital and sexual relationships that are in contravention of the clear teaching of scripture.”Most ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days Joe McCarron: Man released from Donegal hospital by anti-vaccine campaigners to be buried todayFirst Minister Paul Givan has not joined Presbyterian Church, according to DUPAshling Murphy funeral: Mourners told young teacher ‘epitomised the beauty of le’Rocker on acid trip thought Orange band was giant slugTop VideosPlayLarge crowds gather for Ashling Murphy funeralBrian Smith appeared at Newtonards court on Tuesday.A north Belfast was todayconvicted of threatening to kill loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.Following a brief contest at Newtownards Magistrates Court, -year-old Brian Smith was also convicted of harassing Mr Bryson and making a threat that he would petrol bomb the homes of the victims mother and partner, all committed between July -

It was designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and came into force on January , .Commenting on the rise in freight traffic from GB into Northern Ireland, Mr Leheny explained the tougher controls at Dublin Port has contributed to the sht.And Jarlath O#Keefe, from Grant Thornton Ireland, said: The CSO figures for November confirmed that there has been a signicant increase in cross border trade on the island of Ireland in  following Brexit. This is due in part to businesses adjusting their supply chains to avoid the administrative burden associated with importing goods from Britain.”The Department for Agriculture , which is responsible for implementing the protocol, revealed a total of , checks were carried out on , consignments at Northern Ireland’s ports between January , and December , .On average, a total of , trailers or vehicles from GB pass through Belfast, Larne and Warrenpoint ports each year.Sanitary and Phytosanitaryconsignments subject to checks includes live animals, products of animal origin, plant and plant products, and high risk food not of animal origin.The three types of checks required are documentary, identity and physical. Straightforward documentaryand identitychecks made up , of the total checks in . Only , physical checks had to be carried out on lorries.Mr Leheny explained physical checks, which can last for several hours, are a “last resort”the documentary or identity paperwork is not up to scratch.He added that the number of consignment checks would have created a lot more admin work for DAERA officials, hauliers and traders.“A physical inspection is a last resort so it’s natural that would be as low as it is becausethe documentation doesn#t give DAERA the information they need well then they have to open up the doors,” said Mr Leheny.“They would say it’s potentially an unknown load so we have to physically open up the trailer and see what’s in it.”The DUP’s Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson felt the figures should act as a “sobering statistic” for those who think the protocol is necessary. Behind those figures is a story of additional costs, delays, disrupted supply chains and products which had to be disposed of because checks meant goods got ruined,” he said.DUP MLA Diane Dodds added that % of all EU checks take place between GB and Northern Ireland and the figures highlight “the scale of the Irish Sea border imposed by the protocol”.“It is % more expensive to transport goods into Northern Ireland now because of the protocol#s paperwork costs,” she continued. “The Government has a responsibility to take action and we need to see a timetable for progress quickly set out.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the “best way” to reduce checks at ports is for the UK Government to agree to an EU proposal for a Swiss-style veterinary agreement, which would remove almost all physical SPS checks.“We have been making this proposal for months because we know that it will reduce checks and controls by %,” said the Foyle MP.Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the SPS checks are a product of Brexit, and “in particular the decision” of the UK Government to opt for a hard Brexit.“An SPS agreement is necessary to reduce the current checks and those that would be otherwise requiredthe grace period ends without a permanent solution,” he stated.A spokesperson for DAERA said under the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland is required to apply SPS checks on eligible goods entering the EU zone from GB, in line with those checks prescribed for Third Countries.

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian. He would always try to fill everyday with experiences, something Kieron also tries to do, as he loses himself in the otherworldly surroundings of the loughrsquos seabed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Celtic Bhoys kick off new year with win  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys kicked off the new calendar year by picking up all three points away to long time league rivals Newcastle Swts at a soaking wet Donard Park on Saturday afternoon.An early Shaun Megahey penalty gave The Hoops a lead they would never relinquish before captain Michael Rice and marksman Jay Gibney ensured there would be no late rally from the Seasiders.Newcastle will count themselves unlucky to concede a penalty kick just five minutes in for a handball that they disputed actually came off a green and white jersey.Nonetheless, Celticrsquos ever reliable defender, Shaun Megahey, made no mistake with the spot kick and sent goalkeeper Fintan Canavan the wrong way to open the scoring.The Hoops kept their foot on the pedal with striker Jay Gibney testing Canavan from range. Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender. We must abide by the rules in order we can bring the pandemic to an end as quickly as possible. There is no other way and we have to remain as safe as possible, he remarked.ldquoI fully appreciate the damage which the pandemic has done to the local economy and I fear that there could be job losses in .ldquoThe business community in Downpatrick and surrounding towns and villages needs help.

There is no time to waste and no stone should left unturned.Cllr Curran said one bright spot was the plans for the regeneration of Downpatrick.He looked forward to the completion of a pound, scheme to upgrade Church Street and called for the implementation of the much larger scheme for the redevelopment of the former police station site in Irish Street.ldquoWhile things may appear bleak, the regeneration of Downpatrick offers some light, he said.ldquoWe must also look at ways of providing support for our other towns and villages, including Ardglass where there are plans to carry out major improvements to the harbour.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWe are going through a period such as which we have have never experienced before.

And we know the inherent flaws that exist in human nature, even in the best of people. How this new unearthed pathway of dual mandates will be used will reveal itself in time, but I do not believe it will be for the benefit of the Northern Ireland populace, who will give their verdict on it within some months’ time at the next Assembly election.As a politics graduate, I have always been taught to question the intentions of any politician that seeks more power. What will this additional power be used for  Will it be used for the good of the public  I appeal to anyone reading this to ask their MPthey will also stand for election to the Assembly and why they think it is necessary for them to hold power in two dferent legislatures where they couldn’t possibly dedicate their full time to.Michael Palmer, Ulster Unionist Party member, Newtownards——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So two for Northern Ireland would do the job.Note NI already uses nuclear generated electricity. Electricity is pumped undersea from Scotland to Moyle, Co Antrim by the Moyle Interconnector. So some of this electricity will be Scottish nuclear power generated on Scottish soil. A fact those in NI who oppose nuclear energy plants on NI soil must put in their pipe and smoke.And Northern Ireland holiday home owners in Donegal will be using French nuclear energy. The new undersea Celtic Connector links France to the Cork coast. France generates % of its power from nuclear.RR’s world class nuclear energy scientists are confident of strong demand worldwide for their mighty mini nuclear energy stations. Even Republic of Irelandmight buy one by repealing prohibition of nuclear energy generation on Irish soil.Importing nuclear energy from French soil — enough to power half a million homes — to  counties soil has undermined this prohibition position. The EU move just before Christmas to rebrand nuclear energy green is a further blow to continuing RoI prohibition.It seems therefore, North and South, a coach and four is driving through the no nuclear energy stations on our soil argument.So in the May elections I will be asking Foyle constituency candidates what’s their vision, for Derry and Belfast, becoming part of the fast emerging new mighty mini nuclear energy age.My vision ismini nuclear stations generate cheaper electricity up ahead it means no six o’clock folk — those who can only afford energy at tea time in the middle of winter — then we must build them.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event. I know that further development work is necessary, and in fact is being planned and funded, and I welcome that.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a report, entitled A UBI Pilot for Wales, the Petitions Committee concluded the current scheme for care leavers “has merit”, but that a wider trial would allow policymakers to learn more about the impact of a UBI.Universal Basic Income is the idea a government should pay all iniduals a set salary, regardless of their means.Last year, the country’s Labour government said it wanted to pilot such a scheme targeting  care leavers by giving them an additional sum of money each month.Proponents of the plans included those who believe UBI should apply to all citizens, and a petition submitted in August  calling for an expansion of the pilot gained over a thousands signatures.The committee, led by chair Jack Sargeant MS, invited a number of experts including Sophie Howe, the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, Will Stronge, director of research at think tank Autonomy, Lydia Godden, Women’s Equality NetworkWales, and Ewan Hilton, CEO of mental health charity Platfform to give evidence on the topic.They concluded the government should consider increasing the size and ersity of the pilot scheme to provide more robust data, and ensure payments are guaranteed, unconditional, and paid to the inidual, not the household.It has also recommended the government make every effort to persuade UK Government departments such as the Department of Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to support the widest possible pilot scheme.While they said the pilot should be conducted by independent experts, include a control group and attempt to capture any indirect savings or costs that accrue as a result of the pilot.Mr Sergeant said: “It’s clear from the evidence presented to us that broadening the pilot could have huge benefits.“The Welsh Government should investigate increasing the number of proposed recipients and include care leavers from as erse as possible a range of backgrounds, locations, and circumstances to give us the evidence we need to properly evaluate this scheme..remove“While not all Members of the Committee support UBI, we all believe that a wider pilot scheme has the potential to produce richer, more persuasive evidence for the Welsh Government to consider.“I would like to extend my thanks to the petitioners whose passion for tackling poverty shone through and should be commended, as well as all those who signed the petition.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We’ve gone with Dan. He brings that experience.“I think itwill add to Dan’s game.“It is well-documented that Dan is a highly-motivated player, he is very competitive and he speaks his mind. We don’t want to change him as a competitive player.“We want him to take on the role as a captain and the duties that go with that with referees.” vw,vw,px, px\"Wales and Dragons flanker Ross Moriarty The squad includes three uncapped players in hooker Dewi Lake, his Ospreys colleague Jac Morgan and Cardf number eight James Ratti..removeFlanker Ross Moriarty, who has not played since the autumn due to a shoulder problem, makes the group and is on course to feature for his regional team the Dragons a week before Wales’ February  Six Nations opener against Ireland in Dublin.Pivac added: “We are in close contact with the clubs and their medical teams. Ross is on track to play, not this weekend as the Dragons don’t play, but the following weekend.“He will be released from camp to get a game under his belt, andhe comes through that then obviously he will be available for selection for Ireland.”Wales have announced their  squad for the #GuinnessSixNations 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 pic BEcgwR— Guinness Six NationsJanuary , Jones, meanwhile, has undergone two shoulder operations since being hurt during Wales’ Autumn Nations Series opener against New Zealand in October.Hooker Owens has a back problem, Tipuric and Navidi have shoulder issues, North and Halfpenny are recovering from knee injuries and Faletau has not played this season because of ankle trouble.When injuries are added to a number of coronavirus-related cancellations and postponements – the four Welsh regions have only played  games between them in eight weeks – it has been far from a straightforward Six Nations build-up.“Preparing this squad is going to be the most challenging for us to date. Just selecting the squad was an interesting exercise,” Pivac said.Wayne Pivacs thoughts on his squad selection ahead of the  @sixnationsrugby❝Its a very exciting competition, and were very privileged that we were able to win it last year❞ pic cmyMkBqA— Welsh Rugby Union 🏉January , “It is well-documented with the Covid cases in clubs and being stuck in South Africa , it hasn’t been ideal for a lot of players.“I know they’ve been doing a lot of hard work behind the scenes, and we will be doing our best over the first few weeks to put as much volume into them as we can without breaking them.“It’s a fine balance. We have got to get them up to playing Test rugby, and we know that takes a bit of work.“Those players, through no fault of their own, have been put in that situation. So it is working together with the clubs, making sure we’ve got the right information about them in terms of the selection we have made, and we will see where we go from there.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Wayne Pivac hails Wales u Six Nations captain Dan Biggar us  uwealth of experience u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They include having a one-metre social distancing gap between guests and events limited to  people standing indoors and  people sitting indoors. However, there are no limits on the numbers of people attending outdoor events.Scots also need to have a booster to be considered to be fully vaccinated – and only have a window of four months to get it after their second dose to be fully vaccinated.– What is changing from next week Ms Sturgeon has announced that nightclub closures and the requirement for table service in hospitality will come to an end..removeAttendance limits on indoor events and the guidance asking people to stick to a three-household limit on indoor gatherings will also be lted.However, some baseline coronavirus measures which were in place before the Omicron wave will remain.This includes wearing face coverings in public indoor settings and on public transport, as well as working from home whenever it is possible. vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson – What are the rules in England The Prime Minister seems set to end England’s coronavirus measures when their expiry date comes up next week.Indeed, on Tuesday Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he is “cautiously optimistic” that the Government can “substantially reduce” the restrictions.Sajid Javid told MPs it was likely “we have already reached the peak of the case numbers of hospitalisations”.Currently, face coverings are compulsory in most indoor public settings, as well as on public transport, and people have been told to work from homethey can.Secondary school pupils also must wear masks in classrooms.Covid passes are still required for entry into nightclubs and other venues, a rule which has been in place since December .If a person in England has tested positive or has symptoms, they can stop self-isolating after seven days instead of they receive two negative lateral flow test results on days six and seven.Those who are unvaccinated close contacts of positive cases must still isolate for  days.New rules have recently come into force for fully vaccinated travellers as well. They are required to take a lateral flow test, rather than a PCR, no later than the end of day two after their arrival.It is unclear what measures,any, will remain in place after next week. vw,vw,px, px\"First Minister Mark Drakeford – What are the rules in Wales Groups of no more than six people are allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants.Licensed premises can offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected, and two-metre social distancing rules are in place.Nightclubs have been closed since Boxing Day and there is a requirement to work from home wherever possible.Currently, a maximum of  people can attend indoor events and a maximum of  people are allowed at outdoor events.People attending weddings or civil partnership receptions or wakes are also being told to take a lateral flow test before attending.The mandatory isolation period for people who test positive with Covid- is seven, subject to two negative lateral flow tests on days six and seven.And similarly to England, confirmatory PCR tests for asymptomatic people who test positive on a lateral flow device are no longer needed.Rules around travelling are also similar to England, with fully vaccinated travellers needing to take a lateral flow teston day two and,positive, a follow-up PCR test to enable genomic sequencing to be carried out.A pre-departure test and a day two PCR test when arriving in the UK is no longer needed for fully vaccinated travellers.– What is changing from Friday From Friday of this week, Wales will begin a phased lting of restrictions.There will be no limits on the numbers of people able to attend outdoor events and outdoor hospitality will be able to operate without table service.Then from Friday January  attendance limits from indoor events will be lted, including nightclubs, cinemas, and theatres. However, Covid passes will be needed for larger events.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityKeith Waters, , claims his role at the Isle of Ely Primary School in Cambridgeshire, where he was well-known to children and parents, became “untenable” after the comment in June .There were three complaints to the school, where his views were branded “extremist”, “abhorrent” and a “disgusting outburst on a very public ”, but Mr Waters, who has been an evangelical church minister for up to  years, told an employment tribunal that his comments were in line with his conservative Christian beliefs.Mr Waters, from Ely, who is claiming direct and indirect discrimination plus constructive dismissal, believes the school’s investigation of the complaints was flawed because it “applied things that were not to do with the tweet to me”. vw, px\"He told the hearing in Cambridge: “I see that somewere offended. I do not see in the investigation or in the notes that there is any sense that the tweet itself caused an issue.“I believe the way that it was managed by the school caused an issue.“The way the school decided that the easiest and the fastest thing to do would be to slap down my ability to have my rights to live as a Christian, and certainly as a Christian pastor.“I think the school seemed to have a rather knee-jerk reaction. To not have discussed it with me in the first place was rather surprising.”The Twitter post, which coincided with the first Cambridge Pride festival, said: “A reminder that Christians should not support or attend the LGBTQ ‘pride month’ events in June.“They promote a culture and encourage activities that are contrary to Christian faith and morals.“They are especially harmful for children.”Mr Waters worked part-time as a caretaker at the school from January  and resigned in June , just weeks after posting the now-deleted tweet..removeHe said his aim was to warn Christians about LGBTQ Pride events as they may involve nudity, people in sadomasochistic outfits, and displays of an overtly sexual nature.The tribunal heard that the complaints included allegations, which Mr Waters denies, of child molestation, inciting people from other faiths and calling for violence against supporters of the Pride festival.Reaction to the post had included a local Liberal Democrat councillor calling for an apology but “there was not a backlash to the school – there was a backlash to me and around me”, according to Mr Waters.In his witness statement, Mr Waters said he had endured “a campaign of harassment and abuse against me, my family, and my church” after the publicity surrounding his post.This included hate messages sent to his own and the church’s email addresses, undertakers turning up at his home to arrange his funeral, and a visit from estate agents who had been asked to sell his house.Mr Waters handed in his notice and attended a disciplinary hearing that resulted in a final written warning, against which he unsuccessfully appealed.His tweet was branded “anti-LGBTQ” by those who complained to the school who felt it was homophobic, but Mr Waters insisted this was not the case.He told the tribunal: “Sheis saying I can live out my faith but it is curtailed by the school’s policies where they wish it to be curtailed.“The concern is that this is really a subjective thing.”He added that “the problem of having my faith limited by the school’s policies is a big problem, not just for me but for anybody of any faith”.Stephen Peacock, representing the Active Learning Trust which runs the school, told Mr Waters it should be possible to live one’s le and practise one’s faith without circulating harassing, homophobic or discriminatory or offensive material.Mr Waters said he carried out a range of roles at the school, including taking religious lessons and sometimes helping to protect staff from children who were violent.Feeling unable to do his job fully or talk about what was happening to the children or the parents “while all this was going on” made it “impossible” to stay, he said.Deputy headteacher Laura Fielding, who carried out the investigation, described Mr Waters as being “challenging” and unapologetic about his comments or the controversial spotlight it had thrown on the school.The tweet had provoked “signicant” negative publicity, in the local press and online, and the school had to investigate because it had received complaints from parents.Ms Fielding, who said she kept her personal opinion out of the investigation, added: “The LGBTQ community put on these events to celebrate. Criticising these events and saying they are harmful to children was discriminatory against the LGBT community.”Ms Fielding, who accepted that Mr Waters has a right to freedom of speech and religion under the European Court of Human Rights ,  added: “I upheld them.“His beliefs were never in question or asked to be silenced – they just caused the school to go into disrepute.”The hearing was adjourned to Wednesday..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: School had  uknee-jerk u reaction to  uPride harms children u post, tribunal told article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe First Minister said more recent figures, showing a fall in infections, “gives us confidence that we have turned the corner on the Omicron wave”.As a result she confirmed the measures – a limit on the numbers at indoor events, table service only at bars and other places selling alcohol and the closure of nightclubs – will be lted from January .Guidance limiting gatherings to a maximum of three households will also end on the same date, Ms Sturgeon added, along with restrictions preventing adults from taking part in indoor contact sports.She also said there would be no extension to coronavirus vaccine passports at the moment, stating: “Given that cases are now falling quite rapidly, and the current wave is receding, we decided that we will not at this stage extend the Covid certication scheme to other premises.”The announcement comes the day after the Scottish Government lted its cap on numbers at outdoor events, with the First Minister saying the situation was now “much more positive” than it had been earlier in January, when cases had spiked.Speaking at Holyrood, the First Minister said: “Although signicant pressures and uncertainties do remain, the data nevertheless gives us confidence that we have turned the corner on the Omicron wave.” vw,vw,px, px\"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave a coronavirus update to MSPs at Holyrood She told MSPs: “A combination of booster vaccinations, the willingness of the public to adapt their behaviour to help stem transmission, and the temporary protective measures introduced in December, has helped blunt the impact of the Omicron wave.”Her comments came as the latest figures show Scotland recorded another , cases of people being infected with the virus, along with a further  deaths..removeMeanwhile, the number of people in hospital has fallen by  to ,, with  people in intensive care, a rise of one.Ms Sturgeon said over the last week the number of people testing positive with a PCR test had fallen from “an average of almost , a day to just over ,” – a drop of %, with cases declining in all age groups.As a result, the First Minister said she could “say with some confidence that the rise in cases driven by Omicron peaked in the first week of January and that we are now on the downward slope of this wave of cases”.Ms Sturgeon however stressed there were “still some uncertainties ahead” adding that “throwing all caution to the wind would be a mistake”.The First Minister said: “The full impact of theto work and school after the festive break won’t be apparent yet in the data.“So it is possible that we will see case numbers tick up again in the next couple of weeks.”As a result, she said it “makes sense” for remaining restrictions to be lted on a phased basis.Scottish Tory health spokesman, Dr Sandesh Gulhane, said Ms Sturgeon’s statement “begins a sea change” in Government policy – away from “a rules-based approach, more towards trusting the Scottish public”.But the First Minister rejected Dr Gulhane’s assertion the Government did not go far enough on relieving restrictions after the Tories called for an end to home working and the vaccine passport scheme.“The approach that we are taking – have taken – is balanced, it is appropriately and suitably cautious and it is data-driven and for all these reasons it stands in stark contrast to the approach that the Conservatives have proposed at each and every stage,” she said.The First Minister added: “I continue to be really surprised that Dr Gulhane asks me for evidence of things I think even non-clinically qualied people see as pretty obvious.“When you’re coming out of a wave of this virus, the worst thing to do is to lt all restrictions at exactly the same time and allow all of the mixing and interactions that we have been trying to restrict to happen again all at once.”Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, said “too many businesses are teetering on the brink”, raising the case of more than  staff at two Glasgow theatres who have not been paid in more than a month due to delays in support.Asked what she would do to speed up support, the First Minister said: “As I said last week, we are working with local authorities, with other agencies, to get this moneythe bank accounts of those who need it as quickly as possible.”The First Minister went on to say checks had to be undertaken to guard against fraudulent claims..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sturgeon announces
