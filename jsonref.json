[{"url":null,"title":"Kanye Wests stepfather reveals rapper confident prodigy genius child","story":"    Kanye West\u0027s \u0027stepfather\u0027 has told DailyMailTV that the outspoken rapper has always had an ego as he reveals that the \u0027prodigy genius child\u0027 had a slight speech impediment and had dreams of becoming a baseball player          Speaking to DailyMailTV, Blakeley says that from a young age Kanye\u0027s talent was \u0027off the scale\u0027, saying he was \u0027a prodigy genius child from when I first set eyes on him\u0027          Ulysses Blakeley lived with West and his mother Donda throughout the musician\u0027s childhood.   The 67-year-old watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago    Ulysses Blakeley  was one of Donda\u0027s last true loves before she died after a botched cosmetic surgery operation in November 2007Blakeley said Kanye would rap in poems all the time instead of speaking normally, even for the most mundane things, like passing the salt at the dinner table. \u0027We installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does artistically or poetically. So he would speak to you in poems, and sometimes, he\u0027d talk in riddles, and it would be like: \u0027\u0027Stop that now\u0027\u0027. But we tried not to be like that,\u0027 he adds.Although Blakeley says that he doesn\u0027t know how much influence he had on West\u0027s music and art, he does admit: \u0027How much of Kanye was innate and nothing to do with us? It might have been us or might have been the environment we created. We were both musical, writers, and cultural. Did that provide the path to wherever he is?\u0027 Although West was different, he didn\u0027t get bullied and would stand up for himself, a trait he shared with everyone in his family.\u0027He was a tough little kid, not bully-able in any way, shape or form. I remember one time he was out in the park, a boy who was ten or eleven, and Kanye was only five, took his Frisbee and threw it in the tree,\u0027 says Blakeley.\u0027Kanye told him to get it down, but this boy just played around with him, so Kanye socked him, pow, he kicked his a**, regardless of his size. There\u0027s not this intellectual, nerdy reticence in him. There\u0027s nobody in his family like that, they\u0027re forthright and aggressive.\u0027But the family did go to church and Sunday School every week. Donda says in her book that they\u0027d attend Christ Universal Temple in Chicago, a black megachurch on the South Side: \u0027I wanted Kanye to be steeped in that kind of exposure to God.\u0027It\u0027s a little known fact that West also went to a \u0027positive thinking\u0027 kindergarten for black children called the New Concept Development Center, where he was taught Swahili by Donda\u0027s trusted friend and fellow professor, Haki Madhubuti.          The star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island (pictured) - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247          Blakeley said him and Donda \u0027installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does\u0027When Donda and West went to China, they traveled to Thailand, frequenting the red light district of Bangkok and visiting nude beaches on Koh Samui. They also slummed it in the infamous Chungking Mansions, in Hong Kong, a ghetto block, notorious for its sex workers and drug peddlers.According to her book, Donda reveals: \u0027Once, Kanye and I literally took the slow boat from Canton to Hong Kong, where we\u0027d spend two weeks before going on to visit Thailand. \u0027In Hong Kong, we stayed in what became known as Slum King Mansion. The bath was down the hall and the room was definitely no-frills. The cost was eleven US dollars a night, if that tells you anything.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027If Donda was alive he wouldn\u0027t be married to...Jay-Z insists he WASN\u0027T dissing Kanye West over his Trump...\u0027Congrats on influencing all your fans\u0027: Shock as teetotal...Share this article\u0027When we got to Thailand we visited Bangkok first. Kanye went right along to the red-light district with me. From there it was on to Koh Samui. The beaches there are some of the most beautiful in the world. \u0027I was totally embarrassed, though, when one of the professors (also a Catholic priest) asked Kanye what was the favorite part of his holiday. Kanye answered: \u0027\u0027The nude beaches in Thailand\u0027\u0027.\u0027But this is nothing compared to the revelations that Donda reveals about West\u0027s sexual habits when he was approaching his teenage years.She wrote: \u0027I talked with him about it, like I talked with him about everything. There was no topic that was off limits, not even sex. When he was twelve, that conversation came up.\u0027It was my time to car pool and Kanye was in the car along with two of his friends. Jocelyn Elders came on the radio and, as I remember it, she was talking about the rise of teenage pregnancy.\u0027  Blakeley said: \u0027He was a little boy, preschool. He was off the scale. One time, someone asked him when they were looking at his drawings: \u0027Do you want to be an artist when you grow up?\u0027 He said: \u0027I am an artist\u0027. The ego\u0027s always been there!\u0027          Donda revealed in her book that she encouraged Kanye to masturbate rather than having sex with girlfriends at a young age. She added: \u0027I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so\u0027Donda continues in the book: \u0027That\u0027s when I told Kanye and his friends that masturbation was a far better alternative to having sex at such a young age.  \u0027I told them it was perfectly healthy, normal, and gratifying and that they did not have to participate in sex with another partner and risk some young lady getting pregnant or contracting a venereal disease, not the least of which was AIDS. They said nothing.\u0027They just sat there anxious for us to get to school I\u0027m sure, so they could get out of that car. I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so.\u0027After coming back from China, the pair moved home several times.          Blakeley had a special relationship with West, Donda revealed in her 2007 biography, Raising Kanye, which was published just before she diedThe star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247.Donda reveals: \u0027Kanye spent hours and hours mixing, rapping, and writing. It was nonstop. He became so involved that his socializing revolved around that studio in his room.\u0027That thumping bass line seemed to shake the very foundation of our house. Boom-boom-boom day and night. There were all sorts of people coming in and out of the house. \u0027Mainly it was the thundering bass that was no longer welcome—not all day and all night, anyway. I finally had to say to Kanye: \u0027You\u0027re moving\u0027.\u0027Another of his former homes, a tiny, rundown apartment on Lake Bluff Drive, Tinley Park, is where West saw the apparition of Christ - Yeezus meets Jesus!Donda reveals: \u0027One day Kanye was playing in the dining room of our first home in Chicago, a third-floor apartment on the South Side. \u0027All of a sudden, he looked toward the door and the staircase leading down. He pointed and said, \u0027Look, there goes Jesus!\u0027 My heart raced. I saw energy.           Blakeley watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago (pictured)  The house was meant to be turned into a community center for the youth, but arguments between a charity named after Donda and Kanye means it hasn\u0027t happened yet\u0027To this day, I believe it was Christ giving us just a little extra protection that day. Neither Kanye nor I have spoken of it since.\u0027But it was very real to me and just one of the reasons I think Kanye is connected in a special way or for a special purpose. God has chosen him to not only reach but also touch millions.\u0027 Kanye\u0027s first job was as a busboy collecting plates at the American diner chain Bob Evans.Although, according to Donda, \u0027he decided immediately that bussing tables was not something that would work for him. He quit on his first day before he even started.\u0027When West finally broke onto the music scene, he moved to New York, where he found an apartment at the Hudson Tea Building, in New Jersey, directly across the river from Manhattan, as can be seen in our images.\u0027We rented it, sight unseen. It was $850 a month, with a living room and a step-up great room with a glass ceiling. You could actually look up and see the sky. It was wonderful. And Kanye was inspired...\u0027Kanye loved that place. He called up his friends and said, \u0027Man, you should see this place. It\u0027s like something off of TV.\u0027 Kanye was exactly where he wanted to be. He was on his way to fulfilling his dream,\u0027 says Donda in her book.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Kendall Jenner Ben Simmons slip college basketball game canoodle","story":"    Kendall Jenner and her rumored boyfriend Ben Simmons stunned students when they turned up at a college basketball game in Philadelphia          The Keeping Up With The Kardashians superstar and the 76ers athlete slipped into a game at Drexel University on Saturday afternoon to watch as the Drexel Dragons took on the Robert Morris Colonials      Go hell for leather like Kendall wearing a coat by FrameAvailable at FWRDIf there is one coat doing the rounds amongst the A-list it’s got to be this one by Frame, which has already been seen on Kaia Gerber, Kylie Jenner and now it was Kendall Jenner’s turn.The model made quite the statement when attending a basketball game this week as she opted to wear the leather trench coat with straight-leg trousers and trainers, which resulted in a casual look.

It is pictured today     Meghan (pictured in London on November 19) has been having secret briefings with a number of organisations, including CAMFED – the Campaign for Female EducationBy Rebecca English, Royal CorrespondentThe Duchess of Sussex is to put education for women in developing countries at the heart of her public work, when she announces her first royal patronages next year, Mail Online can reveal.Meghan, 37, has been having secret briefings with a number of organisations, including CAMFED – the Campaign for Female Education – which works in several African countries, including Zambia, which was visited by Prince Harry last week.It is understood that she and Harry are keen to work together on the issue in their role as roving Commonwealth youth ambassadors.Meghan is a passionate advocate of the work of charity CAMFED, which believes one of the best way to alleviate poverty and inequality is through education. It has already affected the lives of nearly three million girls and young women across sub-Saharan Africa.Its CEO, Lucy Lake, who was with the sixth in line to the throne in Zambia, revealed to the Mail that she had briefed his wife privately at Kensington Palace earlier this year about their work in the country, as well as Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi.The Duchess was also met with Zimbabwean-born Angeline Murimirwa, one of the first girls to go to secondary school with the organisation\u0027s support and is now its African executive director. She was named last year as one of the BBC\u0027s 100 most inspirational women.Lucy said: \u0027We had the opportunity to meet with the Duchess in the spring. As an organisation our team very much represents what we are working towards and that was why the Duchess was interested to meet with us and hear more about that.\u0027The way both she and her husband have spoken about these issues in such a thoughtful and discerning manner has really helped the wider movement. It\u0027s exciting times.\u0027We have been working for 25 years supporting girls through education and enabling those young women to make the transition in their communities into positions of leadership, to turn around and support the next generation.\u0027It\u0027s wonderful that the Royal Family is engaging with the issue in this way. For the young people in Zambia to feel that Prince Harry was on a level with them and genuinely interested in what they are doing, left them very inspired and motivated, as was he. That\u0027s a very powerful force. \u0027            It is understood that she and Harry (seen at their wedding on May 19) are keen to work together on the issue in their role as roving Commonwealth youth ambassadorsIt is hoped that the pregnant duchess will be able to travel out to Africa and see CAMFED\u0027s work for herself after she has had her baby next spring.Royal sources say the duchess has been having meetings with a number of organisations and is still finalising which areas to work in and what charities to support as she moves on with her public work.It is understood that she is particularly keen to support issues where she can work alongside her husband.Aides hope to make an announcement about her first patronages in the new year, eight months after she joined the Royal Family.Although it is considered quite a long time to wait before announcing her patronages, it is understood that Meghan wishes to \u0027really get to know\u0027 the organisations she wants to work with in order to make a \u0027real and lasting\u0027 difference.                           "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/04/19/054AB3B2000007D0-0-image-a-10_1543951528979.jpg","title":"PIERS MORGAN Ex friend Meghan Markle ruthless social climbing actress used getting way","story":"    I met Meghan online in 2015 when I became a fan of \u0027Suits\u0027, on which she costarred with, among others, Rick Hoffman, seen just to her left in this cast photo          Within minutes of me following her on Twitter, she sent me this Direct Message - and we started corresponding on a regular basis for the next yearWithin minutes, she sent me a private Direct Message: ‘Well hello there – thanks for the follow. Big fan of yours!’I replied, and for the next few months, we corresponded on a regular basis.We’d chat about everything from US gun violence (she shares my horror of it) to a charity trip she made for the United Nations to Rwanda, spinning classes, calligraphy, and our joint hatred of 4am filming call-times - hers for Suits and mine for Good Morning Britain in the UK.She even started sending me early preview episodes of her show so we could debate juicy storylines yet to air – which we did, at length.Meghan introduced me via cyberspace to another Suits cast member, Rick Hoffman - who played Louis Litt – and he and I also began to regularly correspond.

Would love to say hi!’I suggested my local pub, the Scarsdale Tavern in Kensington – ironically just a few hundred yards from where she now lives at Kensington Palace.‘Serena Williams sends her love,’ she texted on the day from Wimbledon, where she was watching her friend play in the annual tennis tournament. ‘You’re very popular as it turns out. Get you!’I don’t hear those words very often, so they made an impression…Then she turned up at the pub and we had a very enjoyable time for 90 minutes or so before I put her in a taxi to a dinner she was having with friends at 5 Hertford Street, a fashionable club in London’s Mayfair.She spoke very candidly about her family - there were some private, sensitive things she told me I would never repeat because they were said in confidence - Donald Trump (she’s not a fan), and of course, Suits.She asked me for advice on her career and the media, and if she could come on Good Morning Britain next time she was over, which I said I would arrange.From the cab, Meghan sent me a series of texts thanking me and saying she was looking forward to meeting up again next time we were in the same city.She even publicly tweeted about how nice it was to see her ‘friend’ – me – in London.So at this point, I was indeed labouring under the massive misapprehension that we were friends.I was wrong.She met Prince Harry at the dinner that night, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again.Not a word.I’d been ghosted.          She met Prince Harry at a dinner the night we met in person, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again. Or her costar. I\u0027d been used. They were just rudeAnd not just by her.At Meghan’s behest, Rick Hoffman ghosted me too.I didn’t hear from him again for 18 months, then he eventually crawled out of the woodwork after attending the big royal wedding last May.‘Piers! I am very sorry for not responding,’ he wrote in a lengthy message. ‘You must understand, once I heard the news, out of respect for Meghan, I couldn’t share a thing. Now I can share fun stuff! I would love to catch up at that favorite pub of yours. Hope to hear from you pal. Love you pal. Rick.’I didn’t reply, because no, I didn’t ‘understand’.A real ‘pal’ doesn’t ghost a friend for 18 months, right?That’s just rude.In fact, I found the behaviour of the pair of them damn rude.I’d been ‘played’ by a couple of B-list actors, who were clearly just using me to advance their careers.           From the moment I read that Harry barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at staff in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sankBut when someone more important and influential came along, in the shape of Prince Harry, I was instantly dumped like a sack of spuds (that’s what we call potatoes in the UK).Now, on a certain level, I grudgingly admire the work.And frankly, who am I, a former tabloid newspaper editor, to take a dim view of such ruthless antics?But on another level, the whole experience left me feeling suspicious and cynical about Ms Markle.And nothing in her behaviour since marrying Prince Harry has alleviated those concerns.From the moment I read that he barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at palace courtiers in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sank.Because I fear that’s exactly what she’s used to getting.And anyone or anything that may not give her what she wants or gets in the way of her social climbing self-advancement gets discarded.Her first husband? Ditched as her Suits career took off.Her dysfunctional family? Banned from the wedding – all of them.Her poor old ailing Dad? Cut off and disowned for struggling to cope with media attention about his daughter.Meghan’s swapped her dreary, problematic old real world for a thrilling new fantasy world of the Queen, Michelle Obama and the Clooneys.Only her mother Doria made the cut to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new life.          Her first husband Trevor was ditched as her Suits career took off          She ditched her family, cut off her ailing father and and only mom Doria made the list to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new lifeBut pieces of work never change their spots.Now, there is a steady flow of negative stories streaming from Palace ‘insiders’ about Meghan’s alleged a antics.She was said to have ‘displeased’ the Queen by demanding an emerald tiara for the wedding.There are rumours of a growing rift with the Duchess of Cambridge, who was reported to have burst into tears over Meghan’s hostile behaviour during a bridesmaid dress fitting for her daughter Princess Charlotte.Kate was also reported to have complained about Meghan being needlessly unpleasant to a royal member of staff.

It has already affected the lives of nearly three million girls and young women across sub-Saharan Africa.Its CEO, Lucy Lake, who was with the sixth in line to the throne in Zambia, revealed to the Mail that she had briefed his wife privately at Kensington Palace earlier this year about their work in the country, as well as Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi.The Duchess was also met with Zimbabwean-born Angeline Murimirwa, one of the first girls to go to secondary school with the organisation’s support and is now its African executive director. She was named last year as one of the BBC’s 100 most inspirational women.Lucy said: ‘We had the opportunity to meet with the Duchess in the spring.

Jordan\u0027s performanceMuch is still in flux in the Oscar race ahead of Thursday morning\u0027s Golden Globes nominations. But unless something drastic happens, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 will next month become the first comic book film to be nominated for best picture and easily Marvel Studios\u0027 most significant Oscar contender ever.That\u0027s very good news for ABC\u0027s Feb. 24 telecast which is coming off an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers. Some 55.2 million watched \u0027Titanic\u0027 sweep the 1997 Oscars, and producers have long harbored dreams of another big-tent blockbuster pulling viewers to a broadcast increasingly dominated by independent films like \u0027The Shape of Water,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Moonlight\u0027 and \u0027Spotlight.\u0027 Usually, bigger movies mean bigger ratings.For the makers of \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 it\u0027s a new chapter for a film - with more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the third-highest all-time domestic gross and the biggest box-office hit ever directed by a black man - that has already filled record books. What does Coogler think of \u0027Black Panther\u0027 as an Oscar movie?\u0027Fortunately, I don\u0027t have to think about it that much,\u0027 the 32-year-old filmmaker of \u0027Fruitvale Station\u0027 and \u0027Creed\u0027 said in an interview. \u0027I\u0027ve grown to have close relationships with my collaborators, so I care about the crafts people who work on the film and the actors who work on the film. Because of those relationships, I\u0027m happy when they\u0027re happy. It\u0027s always nice when people are recognized for their work. But beyond that, I really don\u0027t worry about it.\u0027 The film is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison and Hannah Beachler\u0027s production designYet few films will be watched more closely through awards season than \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 which is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison (who last year became the first woman ever nominated in the category), Hannah Beachler\u0027s production design, Coogler\u0027s direction, the script by Joe Robert Cole and Coogler, Kendrick Lamar\u0027s song \u0027All the Stars\u0027 and Michael B. Jordan\u0027s supporting performance.\u0027Black Panther\u0027 has already been at the center of the uproar over the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u0027 short-lived plans to institute a \u0027best popular film\u0027 category. The academy\u0027s move was intended to rope in more box-office hits to the broadcast, but critics said such a category would potentially ghettoize films like \u0027Black Panther\u0027 from the prestigious honor of best picture. (Coogler declined to address the category\u0027s scuttling.)While superhero films have dominated multiplexes for the last decade, the Oscars have been famously resistant to them. Ten years ago, \u0027The Dark Knight\u0027 earned eight nominations but missed out on best picture, prompting the film academy to expand the category the following year.   Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting a connection to the film, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did\u0027          With more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the film has the third-highest all-time domestic grossMany of the academy\u0027s members resent how superheroes have come to dominate the industry, but there have been some signs lately that anti-Marvel sentiment is ebbing. Last year, while \u0027Wonder Woman\u0027 failed to earn a nod, the Wolverine sequel \u0027Logan\u0027 became the first superhero film nominated for best adapted screenplay . This year, best animated film may also be a superhero battle, with \u0027Incredibles 2\u0027 and \u0027Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u0027 among the favorites.But the awards campaign for \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is predicated less on its superhero DNA than on its cultural impact and on its personal nature as, despite its budget, an auteur film by one of the most widely respected young filmmakers in Hollywood. \u0027Black Panther\u0027 last week for a day played for free in arthouse theaters nationwide in an event put on by Art House Convergence and Film Comment.George H.W. Bush\u0027s service dog Sully visits his casket in...Grateful George W. and Laura Bush make a surprise visit to...Share this articleFor Coogler, making \u0027Black Panther\u0027 couldn\u0027t be more personal. It was a journey in finding his own connection to Africa. While developing the script, he visited South Africa, Kenya and the Kingdom of Lesotho - a tiny nation that inspired Coogler\u0027s Wakanda.\u0027In simple terms, the film is what brought me to the continent,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027It was kind of a lifelong thing just to get there and see it. The thing that I found was a sense of identity as an African person. I found in those trips and through that research a definition for myself of what it means to be African. That was a question I was seeking as a filmmaker.\u0027Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting that connection, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did.\u0027\u0027Black Panther\u0027 arrived to feverish enthusiasm and debuted in the most resplendent and regal Hollywood premiere of the decade. It has been called \u0027a defining moment for Black America,\u0027 pop-culture myth-making at its best and the best big-budget studio epic in ages. Parents took their kids and kids took their parents in a groundbreaking generational event. Theaters were rented out. It was the No. 1 film at the U.S. box office for five straight weeks.\u0027We always saw it as a film to watch with your loved ones, with your friends and with strangers, in communal settings,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027People are still interested in doing that and it feels fortunate.\u0027In a year where Netflix has a formidable Oscar contender in Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s \u0027Roma,\u0027 and fears of the diminishing of the theatrical experience pervade the industry, that may be the most appealing reason for academy members to vote for \u0027Black Panther\u0027: It proved the still-vibrant, earth-shattering power of the movie theater.

Pictured: Yoko in the studio with the Beatles (pictured in 1969)          But by 1972, the \u0027dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027. The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, (pictured with John in the 1970s) a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the coupleTheir relationship would lead to suffocation for John and he talked of orce while Yoko had found her métier running the iconic British band\u0027s empire.\u0027Her detractors, however, and there are many, point to some clever plotting and attention-seeking behavior on her behalf\u0027, writes Connolly. \u0027A little-known avant-garde artist who was wishing to make a name for herself in a new country could do no better than by finding a way of association with the Beatles, and especially John Lennon, whose every action was newsworthy and was now rich enough to be a very important person\u0027.The Beatles lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after finishing their first North American tour in the summer of 1964.           Author Ray Connolly writes in Being John Lennon: A Restless Life that Yoko found a way to make a name for herself through John Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol.When Bob Dylan introduced the band to marijuana, consumption quickly progressed to smoking it for breakfast.LSD became John\u0027s next drug of choice and he took acid while reading a book by Timothy Leary about destroying your ego.Lennon\u0027s drug habits caused him to start panicking about death threats to the group, who were then confined to their hotel while touring.When crowds started spitting at them, the band decided it was time to \u0027give rock a rest.\u0027\u0027It was f***ing humiliation,\u0027 John said. \u0027One has to completely humiliate oneself to be what the Beatles were.\u0027The whole Beatle thing was just beyond comprehension. I was eating and drinking like a pig, and I was as fat as a pig\u0027.\u0027The Ku Klux Klan had nailed Beatles albums to burning crosses and radio stations began to ban the playing of Beatles records,\u0027 writes the author.\u0027To John, ever dissatisfied with the way things were, the idea of a spiritual rebirth, a starting again, was always attractive\u0027.The group went their separate ways - George went to India, Paul composed music for a movie, Ringo took a holiday and John went to Spain before returning to London.          The Beatles (above in 1965) lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after making their first North American tour in summer of 1964. Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol          Yoko, a heroin addict, turned up in Lennon\u0027s (pictured in 1969) life during a time when he was seeking a spiritual rebirth and turned him onto her drug of choice, and she would eventually be instrumental in breaking up the BeatlesEnter Yoko Ono, who always claimed that their meeting at the Indica Gallery in London was \u0027purely by accident\u0027.John had been dropped off at the gallery by owner John Dunbar. He viewed the art as a con and suspected that he was being hustled to buy something.Downstairs he was introduced to \u0027a very small Japanese lady wearing a black sweater and black trousers, peering out from between two curtain folds of long black hair\u0027.She was preparing her exhibition opening the following day and was in London with her current husband and child, Kyoko.Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author.One of her art pieces was a board with a chain and a hammer hanging on it and a bunch of nails at the bottom.John asked: \u0027Can I hammer a nail in it\u0027? \u0027No\u0027, she said and walked away.She came back and asked for five shillings. Lennon had no money on him and said he would give her five imaginary shillings to hammer in an imaginary nail.She later contacted Lennon and asked him for an original music score for a short film. He sent lyrics to one of the Beatles\u0027 songs but John didn\u0027t know that she had initially asked Paul who refused her request.\u0027Yoko had broken into the orbit of the Beatles\u0027, writes the author.A few weeks after the Indica Gallery meeting, she showed up at the Beatles\u0027 office in Mayfair hoping to speak to John.She wanted financial backing to wrap the statues of the lions in Trafalgar Square in canvas.          Yoko had John finance her art project that featured a room that had half of every object. Pictured: Yoko sitting in her \u0027half bedroom\u0027 in 1968          Yoko has always claimed that she met John at the Indica Gallery in London \u0027purely by accident\u0027.

Pictured: The couple in 1971In John\u0027s absence, she pitched the idea to Ringo who was \u0027non plussed --- and commented she might just as well have been speaking in Japanese for the little he understood of her plan\u0027.\u0027From the very beginning of her career, she understood the power of networking and self-promotion especially self-promotion,\u0027 according to Connolly, a veteran journalist and screenwriter who John befriended in the late 1960s.Yoko\u0027s next move was to send John a copy of her self-published book of \u0027instructional poems\u0027 called Grapefruit.One poem was: \u0027Stir inside of your brains with a penis until things are mixed up. Take a walk. Smoke everything you can, including your pubic hair\u0027.John \u0027felt that she was the star and he the audience\u0027.He hadn\u0027t felt that for a long time. She was an enigma to him. Never had he met anyone like this \u0027odd little Japanese woman dressed in her black intellectual\u0027s uniform,\u0027 writes the author.In the summer of 1967, the Sgt. Pepper album was released, while John was still high on LSD and feeling \u0027needles of jealousy\u0027 towards Paul for his clever songwriting.Beatles manager Brian Epstein was dead of an accidental overdose of sleeping pills, leaving John feeling guilty having introduced his old friend to pills.John knew years earlier that Epstein, openly gay, had fallen in love with him. It made John question his own sexuality and he once let Brian pleasure him him but then he later turned on him and called him a \u0027queer Jew\u0027. Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John, getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was.She even showed up at a meeting that John, Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian Himalayas.

He collected the letters at the post office so his wife, Cynthia, would be none the wiser.Yoko never quit the chase and John made up his mind to orce Cynthia, his high school Brigitte Bardot fantasy, and leave his wife and child for Yoko. Yoko, seven years John\u0027s senior, was born in Tokyo, her father a wealthy banker and a Christian, her mother a Buddhist. When her father was posted to a position in the U.S. and the family moved to Scarsdale, New York, Yoko enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers but dropped out after meeting a Japanese composer, Toshi Ichiyanagi, studying at the Julliard School, a performing arts conservatory.They were married and with little money, Yoko waitressed to support her bohemian lifestyle and her conceptualist art.\u0027If she received any reviews at all, they were usually critical, but criticism and rejection never stopped her\u0027, writes the author. \u0027Her belief in herself was total\u0027.She had affairs during that short-lived marriage and the couple separated with Yoko returning to Japan and putting on one of her conceptual art \u0027events\u0027.Failing to ignite any excitement, she was institutionalized by her husband and family after overdosing on sleeping pills.American filmmaker, Tony Cox pursued Yoko in Japan and helped her get out of the hospital.

Pictured: John and Yoko in one of the last photos of John before he was shot dead in 1980 \u0027He got her out of the mental hospital in Japan, he kept her going, raised money for her shows...went after all the publicity, found backers for her films, borrowed money from banks...\u0027 writes the author, and now she was dumping him for someone rich and famous.John was blinded by Yoko and saw her as the most intelligent woman he had ever met as well as being very beautiful.The workforce at Apple Records didn\u0027t like Yoko and remembered her as \u0027a very pushy broad with not an ounce of humble in her\u0027.Mimi, John\u0027s aunt, told a reporter, \u0027I didn\u0027t like the look of her from the start\u0027. \u0027My God, what\u0027s that?\u0027 she said on first sight and dubbed her \u0027the poisoned dwarf\u0027.Little did Mimi know at the time that Yoko introduced heroin to John who began sniffing it regularly. John and Yoko were busted for hash, traces of marijuana and half a gram of morphine. John\u0027s own arrest didn\u0027t phase him. \u0027I was stoned all the time and just didn\u0027t give a s**t\u0027, he told Connelly.He was so stoned, he no longer cared about the once magical writing relationship with McCartney.While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music.          While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music. Neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four          After Yoko gave her blessing to May and John (pictured together in 1974), the pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months. Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day still high on heroinThey just didn\u0027t like her – and neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four. \u0027I think you\u0027re both nuts, the pair of you\u0027, Ringo told John.Yoko had driven a wedge between John and Paul as well as into the management battle and the new agent asking for a larger percentage.Life at the Dakota apartment building on Manhattan\u0027s Upper West Side where the couple lived turned into suffocation for the Beatle. John spent hours sleeping or staring mutely at the TV.\u0027The dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027, writes the author. The myth of perfect love evaporated by 1972.The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the couple.The pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months.Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day.John was now happier than he had been in years --- until Yoko rang saying she had found a cure for John\u0027s cigarette smoking – hypnotism and that could only take place at the Dakota.May wasn\u0027t invited to the session and off John went in January 1975.John never revealed what transpired during the session but he became quite ill and the author suggests some kind of aversion therapy transpired.John saw May on the sly but he was back in the grip of Yoko.          \u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027. Pictured: John and Yoko in November of 1980 \u0027She had needed him for his fame and the cachet it gave her, for his money and the limousines. She made him feel clever and not just a rock and roller. Now as she ran the Dakota apartment and staff, and sat in his place on the Apple board, she seemed to offer to bring order to his life\u0027, writes Connolly.\u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027.She took control of all of John\u0027s finances and became his manager.But his muse was dried up and for the next four years, John was rarely seen in public.He had nowhere to go, no one to see and spent time watching Dumbo cartoons with their young son, Sean.He became anorexic thin and was sure that the FBI was listening in on all his calls. No calls from friends were put through to him. \u0027Yoko has him all locked up\u0027, Mick Jagger said.\u0027Yoko had found her métier in life – she ran the busy Lennon empire\u0027 – according to whether or not Mercury was in retrograde.Lennon\u0027s days were spent living on the fringes of \u0027a world that Yoko was running without him\u0027.It was only when John went on a stormy sailing trip from Cape Town, South Africa to Bermuda that he regained his self-confidence and sense of self-worth.On his return he was ready to write and record again. But it wasn\u0027t to be.John was shot dead by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980 outside of the Dakota.Thirty-eighty years after the crime, Chapman remains in Attica State Prison. Ray Connolly\u0027s Being John Lennon: A Restless Life is available here. "},{"url":null,"title":"Cuba begin internet access mobile phones","story":"Youths use a password protected wifi network coming from a five star hotel to surf the Internet on their smart phones in downtown Havana, Cuba (stock image)The communist-governed island has one of the world\u0027s lowest rates of internet use but that has been expanding rapidly since Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro declared detente in 2014.

She said she passed out and the next morning thought she\u0027d had a stroke          The shocking footage shows her appear to lose consciousness then collapse on the floor behind the bar           She appears to be out cold on the ground as fellow party-goers gather around to see if she is ok. Afterwards Miss Phillips said she felt forced to quit the pub where Mr Webb still works   The alleged incident took place at the Cameo Club in Roath, Cardiff (pictured) where Miss Phillips and Mr Webb both worked at the timeBar manager, 24, who thought she had suffered a stroke...Flybe pilot who was fired after developing a fear of flying...Share this articleAnd today the footage was played at an employment tribunal, which ruled in Miss Phillips\u0027 favour that she was unfairly dismissed when bosses failed to properly investigate her complaint that she was strangled at the party.She told the court she suffered such serious facial paralysis that she may never be able to smile properly again.The Cameo Club had its last Christmas party on New Years Day but the morning after the bash, she woke up and noticed she had slight facial palsy but was baffled as to why.Fearing she was having a stroke, she went to the doctors but was told her injuries were \u0027either caused by lack of oxygen or nerve damage\u0027.Returning to work, she viewed the CCTV to find out what had gone on and saw Webb appear to choke her.The tribunal heard that burly Mr Webb was arrested over the incident but released under investigation and remained employed by the Cameo Club after the incident.He is still employed by the bar.           Ms Phillips, who had no recollection of what happened, went to hospital the following day fearing she had had a stroke after after sending her mum a photo of her sloping mouth           Mr Webb can be seen on the CCTV leaning over after he appears to throttle the bar manager at the staff Christmas party in CardiffMs Phillips initially returned to work after the incident and told bosses she did not want to take any action.But as time went, she became increasingly distrustful and fearful of WebbAt the same time, medics were telling her that the injuries she suffered would have longer lasting effects than previously thought.Yet when she raised these concerns with the directors of the company, she was told to get over it and ultimately felt she had no choice but to quit.In her judgement following the tribunal, judge Alison Frazer was heavily critical of the Cameo\u0027s directors for failing to take her concerns seriously.She said: \u0027The fact was the CCTV evidence showed that Mr Webb had her in a hold which caused her to fall to the floor.\u0027It was only open to the Respondent to take a view as to what action was appropriate after it had impartially gathered the facts via an investigation.\u0027I find that from April onwards Mr Davies acted in a way which was dismissive of the Claimant\u0027s feelings about the incident. He told her to \u0027get over it\u0027 when referring to the Christmas party incident.\u0027          Ms Phillips (pictured) told how she passed out after chef Mr Webb gripped her neck at a Christmas party  Miss Phillips said she told firm bosses Huw Davies (pictured left at Cardiff magistrates courthouse) and Jason Pearce (right) of the attack, but her complaints were not taken seriouslySince the incident, Ms Phillips says that as well as her partial facial paralysis, she suffers from PTSD, anxiety and depression.She added: \u0027I can\u0027t smile in photographs.\u0027People don\u0027t notice it, but I notice it more than anything.\u0027If it\u0027s still like that when I get married, I won\u0027t be able to smile in my wedding photos. Things like that. It\u0027s not nice.\u0027But she said the worst bit was the fact her bosses didn\u0027t do anything.She continued: \u0027I\u0027d worked there for two and half years and done everything to that place and it was just like, I realised I meant nothing to them and I was completely disposable.\u0027In her evidence at the employment tribunal at Cardiff Magistrates Court in November, she claimed the club\u0027s company director, Jason Pearce, was heard joking about the incident with Mr Webb.She also told the hearing that after other alleged behaviour by Mr Webb including putting chilli in a staff member\u0027s soup and threatening someone on a night out, she told her employers she had begun lose faith in their ability \u0027to keep her safe in her workplace\u0027.She claimed she was told in one meeting on April 4 by another director Huw Davies to just \u0027get over it\u0027, and was told the same comment again on April 18.In her written judgement, Judge Frazer criticised the directors for not fully investigating at this stage.She wrote: \u0027She was able to carry on at work without suffering any real psychological effects, working alongside Mr Webb, until March.\u0027In March the Claimant observed two incidents that made her perceive the Christmas party incident in a different way.\u0027Rightly or wrongly, she formed the view from these incidents that he had the capacity to be violent towards women. This made her believe that she had been the victim of insidious violence at the hands of Mr Webb.\u0027Around this time, she also learnt that her facial paralysis was more permanent than initially anticipated. I find that this culminated in her feeling vulnerable around Mr Webb in the workplace.            Miss Phillips has won her case against the company for unfair dismissal at the employment tribunal and has submitted a personal injury claim. She told the hearing that she felt that she was forced to quit \u0027In my finding there was an inextricable link between the incident at the Christmas party and the workplace, even though it had happened off duty. It was a works Christmas party held on site.\u0027She also criticised the directors for their response to the CCTV footage.She said: \u0027Mr Pearce understood from observation of the CCTV that the Claimant had been strangled.\u0027Mr Davies, on the other hand, denied that this was the case. Mr Pearce did not watch the video until April or May and Mr Davies only watched it once.\u0027The judge concluded that because of their actions - and the actions of another person brought in to hear a grievance that Ms Phillips raised - she was justified in resigning and was \u0027constructively unfairly dismissed.\u0027Afterwards Ms Phillips said she had a \u0027sense of relief\u0027 adding: \u0027It just feels like a weight lifted,\u0027 she added. \u0027I don\u0027t want to think about it anymore.\u0027Cameo Club declined to comment while South Wales Police said: \u0027A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and he is currently released under investigation.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Teenager 17 butchered rival postcode gang","story":"Tavis Spencer-Aitkens, 17, was attacked just yards from his family home in Ipswich on June 2 this year, a trial at Ipswich Crown Court was told.

A group of Cabinet ministers have been mulling it over as a fallback plan. It would effectively keep the UK in the single market, with a customs bolt-on to avoid a hard Irish border, and backers say it would keep Britain close to the EU while cutting contributions to Brussels.However, critics say it has the drawbacks of keeping free movement, - and tightly limiting the possibilities for doing trade deals elsewhere.The EU is also thought to have concerns about a country the UK\u0027s size joining the EEA, while other states in the group might be resistant.  If the Norway model was endorsed by the Commons, it would not be binding on the government.But it would have huge political force, and it might be very difficult for ministers to face down the calls.Mrs May is unlikely to be able to put the policy in place as it break her often-stated red lines.In the end, it might need a new government of national unity, perhaps led by a respected cross-party figure, to put the UK on course for Norway-plus - with the prospect of a general election soon afterwards.   Government faces down Commons revolt and forces through no dealMrs May\u0027s mantra for more than two years was \u0027no deal is better than a bad deal\u0027.And while she appears to have abandoned the claim, many Tory Brexiteers insist the government should stick to its guns.They point out that, as Article 50 has been invoked and the Withdrawal Act passed, that is the default legal outcome.The hard Brexiteer argument is that while MPs can pass motions demanding a change in policy, they will not be binding on the government.Instead they say ministers should simply ignore MPs and try to force through a no-deal outcome. However, that kind of constitutional standoff could be incredibly difficult to sustain.   The Commons has the nuclear option of passing a no confidence vote in the government and putting the country on course for a general election. Although Eurosceptics claim, it would only require seven of them to switch sides or a larger number to abstain. The government also needs to pass legislation to pave the way for the least chaotic possible no deal, and ministers could expect the Commons equivalent of guerrilla warfare to wreck those efforts.  Renegotiate for a Canada-plus dealIf the PM goes down in flames, she - or another Tory PM - could try to go back to the EU and ask for a better deal.Brexiteers have been demanding the UK takes a different approach this time, seeking a looser Canada-style arrangement with the EU. The arrangement they want would be a relatively clean break from the EU, with the ability to strike trade agreements elsewhere.But it would fall far short of the low-friction access urged by Labour and large numbers of Tories. However, time would be a major obstacle, with just months until Brexit day. The EU has also insisted it will not unpick the orce package thrashed out in painstaking negotiations. Mrs May has also pointed out that the Canada model would not solve the Irish border issue, as there would need to be checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Eurosceptics dismiss this problem as confected, saying technology and trusted trade schemes can ensure there is no hard border.They also say that the EU would be more willing to compromise if it really believes that the UK would go through with a no-deal exit.  Second referendum and UK stays in the EUWith Westminster deadlocked, the possibility of asking the public to think again has strong appeal for many MPs.The so-called \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 campaign has been pushing hard for another national vote, with cross-party backing.Again, it is difficult to see how Parliament can trigger a referendum itself - but it could heap pressure on the government to the level where one becomes irresistible.One potential route would be for the Commons to vote no confidence in the government - leaving a caretaker Tory PM with a choice between a referendum and a general election if they lose a second confidence vote. The Article 50 process would probably need to be extended to facilitate a referendum, but the EU seems open to that possibility. Furious Brexiteers, including Michael Gove, have warned that Remainers smell an opportunity to reverse the 2016 vote altogether.He said at the weekend that holding a national vote would \u0027rip the fabric of society\u0027 - although he also claimed that Leave would win by more. Some suggest that a referendum could be fought between the option of Mrs May\u0027s deal and no deal. However, senior Labour figures appear to have come around to the idea of having Remain on the ballot. Tony Blair openly says a referendum should be a way of cancelling Brexit, and MPs across parties - such as Mr Grieve - regard it as probably the only sustainable way of overturning the 2016 result and staying in the EU. If a ruling from the European court next week goes as expected, Article 50 could then simply be revoked - leaving the UK with the same membership terms as now.       "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa4b324e8b6f5ace1bbf39470f18ed22cc3ba43b/0_74_2961_1777/master/2961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86c5716766a2a85f91669df5c4487e28","title":"christmas countdown top tips for gift buying","story":"Save yourself time, money and the stress of last-minute panic buying with our foolproof guide to holiday shoppingThe supermarket shelves are heaving with mince pies, the Christmas party invitations are pouring in – but, once again, you haven’t started your Christmas shopping.

Find out how to be a savvy Christmas shopper with our expert tips.Start earlyIt’s never too soon in December to think about Christmas purchases, says Amanda McCall, director at Gifts International. “The chronic procrastinators among us may not like to admit it, but the only way to do a good job on your Christmas shopping is to start early. We’ve all left buying an important gift until the last minute at some point, but you’re simply not going to find the perfect present if you’re dashing around the shops in a panic on Christmas Eve. So, this year, leave yourself plenty of time.”Be online shopping savvyBe organised about your online shopping and you’ll save time and money. “Decide on some themes from what you know about your family and friends,” says Lena Gore, co-owner of online retail company Find Me A Gift.Simon Exton from AO agrees: “I have lots of young nieces and nephews, so I decided that I was going to buy gaming stuff for them.”Put key dates in your diaryGet familiar with the last posting dates - this year, it’s 18 December for second class, 20 December for first class, 21 December for Royal Mail Tracked 24, and 22 December for Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed.Ask for suggestionsWe all want to give presents that our loved ones actually want. So rather than stressing about finding the perfect surprise, just ask them, says Lucy Ward, creative brand director at online marketplace Trouva. “More often than not, surprises can be a bit of a disappointment, and, in a world that’s thinking more sustainably, we want to be giving less and giving better gifts. I’m an advocate of just straight up asking people what they want. That way, you can guarantee your gift isn’t going to waste.”Stick to your budgetAgain, starting early is key to making sure you don’t spend too much. Make sure you know exactly how much you want to spend – Gore recommends working out an overall budget first, then inidual gift budgets. And she suggests subscribing to the newsletters of the websites you’re thinking of using, to keep an eye on their offers. “Buy as soon as you see an offer you like. If you leave it until the last minute, you’re more likely to impulse buy, which may mean breaking your budget.”Check your delivery datesMcCall recommends going for nominated day delivery options whenever possible. This means you can pick a time and day convenient for you, which is particularly helpful during the busy festive season. “You can also arrange for gifts to arrive while your family are out, so it won’t spoil the surprise before Christmas morning.” Check the delivery options available before you buy: electricals specialist AO offers free delivery on all items, including its Christmas gift ideas and stocking fillers, and provides both click and collect and next-day delivery.Be preparedAvoid the stress of unexpected visitors by stockpiling extra gifts, says McCall. “It’s always lovely to see family and friends during the festive season, but it can be quite embarrassing if you receive a gift and have nothing to offer in return.” She recommends keeping a few festive gifts wrapped up with the tags blank, so you can fill them out at a moment’s notice. “Chances are they’ll never even realise it was a last-minute gift.”Visit AO for great ideas for Christmas gifts and stocking fillers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aea2d1c42130903b3b47ef6c104657db4e78972/263_0_2661_1596/master/2661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b16e6edcefcd9abe44894faa7da92ef","title":"christmas unwrapped how do you open your presents","story":"From cryptic clues to silly stocking fillers, family rituals around present-giving can make for a more memorable festive experienceWhen it comes to opening Christmas presents, many families have their own time-honoured rituals. Maybe you just can’t wait until the 25th and always unwrap a present each on Christmas Eve before heading to mass? Or perhaps you all have to wait until your (usually late) uncle arrives at nana’s before the paper ripping can begin? Maybe you take your time over it and have a methodical approach, spreading out the present-opening over the course of the day.For many people, these traditions, re-enacted year after year with a comforting familiarity, are partly what makes Christmas special to them.Rachael Gibson, who runs The Hair Historian Instagram account, says her family has developed a rather unusual tradition when it comes to opening presents. At the family home in Sheffield, every family member has to present their gift with a cryptic clue tagged to it – and the recipient is forbidden from opening it until they’ve solved the conundrum. “The clue is usually to do with the present, and the format of the clues is pretty open, but they’re always cryptic-crossword-level complex – anagrams, or references to some historical figure or event,” she says.According to Gibson, her mother started adding cryptic clues to presents when she was a teenager. “My mum has always been a crossword fanatic, and she favours the extremely complicated cryptic ones,” she says. “She also loves quizzes and any kind of wordplay, so that has always been a big part of family life. At some point when we were teenagers, my mum decided to introduce a tradition that we had to write cryptic-crossword-style clues on our Christmas presents for one another. Setting clues is a challenge in itself, and I always have it in mind when I’m buying gifts.”The yearly ritual is so ingrained in the household that Gibson, who lives in London, says it wouldn’t feel like Christmas without it. “We’re a small family, with just the four of us, so I like that it marks out our gifts and makes them more special than anything else under the tree,” she says.The Agarwals, like many families, open one present each on Christmas Eve and then leave stockings at the end of their beds. “This has been the same for the past eight years or so,” says Pragya Agarwal, who lives in Formby, Merseyside, with her husband and three daughters – Prishita, 21, and twins April and India, both two. Christmas morning always begins with a hearty breakfast of pancakes and smoked salmon with scrambled eggs. Then the family sits next to the Christmas tree as her husband hands out one present at a time to each person, and they open them at the same time.“We all have our own inidual stockings that we use every year,” says Agarwal, the owner of gift businesses The Art Tiffin and Hedge and Hog Prints. “I bought the stockings in India, and they are beautifully handcrafted in traditional Indian designs. It makes me feel close to my parents who still live in India, and I feel that it fosters the same pride and closeness to their heritage in my children in some way.”Although the stocking fillers can vary from bath bombs to stationery, there are always the same three things sitting at the bottom: gold chocolate coins, a satsuma and a walnut. “Our eldest has grown up with these rituals and they are important to her,” says Agarwal.Creating traditions can define Christmas for families. “I feel that having continuity and these silly and very personal rituals make us feel closer as a family,” says Agarwal. “My twins are just two, so this would really be the first time that they’ll be able to understand Christmas, but I can’t wait to introduce these things to them too.”For great gift ideas and stocking fillers, check out AO’s Christmas range"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccf1d1aa9648925db063971e9e31f639b1a7624/0_47_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37ed961b78c3803744b4319f9eda9eaa","title":"practical makes perfect why the best gifts are the useful ones","story":"We’ve either got gadgets coming out of our ears or we’re jammed into city flatshares too cramped for tat. Is it any wonder many gift recipients simply want something whose function will enhance their lives?Christmas present buyers generally fall into two camps. There are those who believe a present should be thoughtful and sentimental and whimsical, a touch of decadent luxury you would never buy for yourself – think champagne truffles, sparkly gloves or fancy underwear. Then there are the practical gift-givers, the functional Father Christmases, who want to buy a present they know will actually be useful – even if that means wrapping up a microwave oven. But is it possible to find that sweet spot between the two?“With a rising awareness of sustainability, and a general sense of “peak stuff”, we’re seeing people increasingly lean towards either experiences, as opposed to a physical gift, or presents that are more meaningful and useful,” says Lucie Greene, trend forecaster at JWT Innovation. “The era of frivolous novelty junk is almost over. It’s a tax on the planet, and adds nothing to our lives, especially when many live in cities, where space is at a premium.”So those £1 flashing reindeer socks are out, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have a dose of sentimentality in our stocking fillers. “I think the movement in gifting is towards more considered and thoughtful presents,” says Greene. “This ties in with the growing influence of Nordic philosophy, which is to focus on quality over quantity.” Whether it’s food, furniture, electrical items or clothing, buying gifts that are seasonless, of high quality and well-designed is always appreciated. “We might be buying less and spending less, but we’re putting more thought in.”Interestingly, being too thoughtful might actually be making us worse present-givers. According to a 2014 study from the Journal of Consumer Research, we imagine our loved ones will want a gift that is impressive, expensive, and sentimental. And yet gift receivers actually report being happier when they get exactly what they asked for. For coffee aficionados, that might mean getting a top-notch, luxury coffee maker, although your average Joe might be happier with a simpler machine.“Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful” was designer and poet William Morris’s golden rule, and it’s a pretty good rule of thumb for presents too. But, of course, the definition of useful is pretty subjective one person’s deeply practical, everyday item is another’s frivolous folly.“Try to think about a person’s interests and what they like to do on a daily basis, and then elevate it so that you make it a bit special,” says Polly Hadden-Paton, a professional gift-buyer tasked with buying last-minute gifts for many famous or busy clients.As with many trends that have become mainstream, millennials were early adopters of what’s been called “stealth luxury”. David Burstein, author of Fast Future: How the Millennial Generation Is Shaping Our World, explains: “The younger generation came of age at a time when spending lots of money on flash things had a negative connotation, thanks to the 2008 financial crisis. While a few decades ago Yuppies splashed their cash on expensive gadgets for their significant others, such as watches and jewellery, now Muppies (that’s millennial yuppies, FYI) are more likely to want to receive high-value items that serve a purpose and add real value to their lives, such as iPhones or Nutribullets.”Veer too far towards utility, of course, and you’ll find yourself in the doghouse. “I had a friend whose mother-in-law bought her a drying rack for Christmas,” recalls Hadden-Paton. “That’s probably a bit too practical.”Visit AO for great ideas for Christmas gifts and stocking fillers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfd7c1ec0e7dd10eada046f5e340928c26ddfa96/0_0_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5cc37abf797038b5aa571db9b03d29e","title":"top toys for 2018 and the 500 extra youll spend five facts about christmas shopping","story":"Expect to see slime and the Boxer robot topping children’s gift lists, plenty of online shopping, and more socks under the treeWe spend the equivalent of two working weeks preparing for ChristmasChristmas is time-consuming.

A young star of French philosophy is doubtfulRecently I saw a woman in a train station wearing a T-shirt that read: “I wish ‘common sense’ were more common.” As a form of political protest this slogan is extremely mild, but perhaps that was the satirical point in an age of furious isions, where increasingly everyone is either a Nazi or a snowflake. The worst, as a poet once wrote, are full of passionate intensity.Now the young French philosophy star Tristan Garcia has decided that “intensity” itself has become “the ethos of our age”. Whatever we do, we must feel it intensely we must be the most intense version of ourselves. We pursue ever heightened intensities in our ersions: extreme sports, extreme pornography, extreme metal. This value, Garcia notes, crosses political boundaries: everyone agrees that one must pursue “existential intensity”, even if they disagree as to what – hedonism, fundamentalism – will supply it. The point of life is to live it to the full, to pack it with the highest intensity, and “only this feeling of excitement allows us to live our lives free from bitterness and resentment”.Garcia traces the genealogy of this ethos back to the original spectacular public demonstrations of electricity in the 18th century. In his story – which relies, as the notes by translators Abigail RayAlexander, Christopher RayAlexander and Jon Cogburn point out, on work by the American philosopher Mary Beth Mader – the “electric fluid” was construed as a liberating, magical force, intensity itself made powerful and visible. As scientists discovered that electric currents also mediate the working of our nerves and neurons, a new kind of human being was conceived: the “electric person”, who takes as her motto the statement by De Sade that “it is purely a question of exposing our nervous system to the most violent possible shock”.In one of his occasional lovely cultural asides, Garcia writes: “In some ways, the romantic is a libertine who, having deserted cities and salons, discovers outside of her body a sort of nervosity belonging to all of nature.” The electric person finally attains his apotheosis, for Garcia, in the figure of the electric guitarist of mid-20th century rock music, whom he describes as necessarily hormonal and adolescent. In our time, we are not merely electric people but “intensive” people, defined as people on whom intensity is morally forced, by “a social injunction that demands that she always love, work and have fun with ever greater intensity”. And yet “electric modernity” is now on its last legs, being replaced by the less intense electronic age. What to do next?So far this is interesting and persuasive as a work of cultural analysis in the tradition of, say, Guy Debord or Jean Baudrillard. But it also has ambitions to count as a work of technical philosophy, which is where it will ide readers who come up against statements such as this: “Intensity is the very concept of that which resists conceptualisation.” Those who enjoy continental philosophy will gaze at the pretty paradox and read something tremblingly profound into it those more into analytic, mainly anglophone philosophy will snort and say, well if it can’t be conceptualised, what is the point of trying to write a book about it?Later he doubles down: “The concept of intensity represents something that resists all logic and calculation. Nevertheless, there is a logic of intensity.” What is this logic-resisting logic, you ask? “Paradoxically, the more intensity our feelings gain, the more intensity they lose.” He means that, like a drug addict, the person seeking intensity develops tolerance and needs ever increasing doses for the same effect. But it would have been easy to say that without first announcing the impossibility of thinking about it. Garcia’s partiality for the preening paradox, indeed, does risk making him look like a bit of a pound-shop Zeno. Elsewhere, he gets relativity wrong, and mistakenly claims that evolutionary biologists have abandoned the concept of a species. (Actually they just disagree about how exactly to define one.)But these are all details: for Garcia the real question is how to live. In the book’s peroration, he gloomily opposes “thought” to intensity. Thought, for him, has no intensity and “nullifies life”. So how can we maintain the intensity of our feeling of life while also thinking? For Garcia this is, he seriously claims, the most important ethical dilemma of modern times. One wonders if he has tried just going for long walks, as Nietzsche and Kant did. Having finished this book – by turns clever and silly, perceptive and slapdash – it’s hard to shake the feeling that this is only really a big problem for the kind of intellectuals who don’t get out enough.• The Life Intense is published by Edinburgh.

We’re all familiar with the narratives associated with these original enclosures. For boosters, civilisation as we know it was born out of putting up the fences and stopping the peasantry from grazing their livestock. Christophers is at pains to distinguish between the alienation of rights involved in these historical enclosures (which didn’t necessarily entail transfer of title), and the new ones, where ownership is of the essence. In both instances, however, the rationale has been increased efficiency of resource exploitation.The grand narrative of liberal progress, from improved agriculture, to investment in new industrial processes, to the giddy elevation of the City’s glassy epitomes of purely financial capitalism, arguably rests on this very prosaic footprint: land. As for neoliberalism, Christophers, after considering the available options, plumps for privatisation itself as its defining element. If privatisation, he writes, “is indeed the cardinal feature of British neoliberalism, then the biggest privatisation of them all, that of land, is arguably the country’s seminal political-economic development over the past four decades”. Why then, do we know so little about it – especially given we Britons are currently going through such a grand public convulsion regarding our sovereignty?Christophers acknowledges the pioneering work of the late Doreen Massey (to whom his book is dedicated), whose analysis of land tenure in the period immediately preceding Thatcher’s privatisation drive sets the scene for what ensued. Massey was quick to understand that land was becoming “financialised” before the term was even coined – quick, also, to grasp its implications for both the commonwealth and inidual rights.That her initial work wasn’t taken further – or was developed only sporadically – is in large part, Christophers suggests, due to secrecy. The parties involved in the land privatisations have made no effort to publicise them. What’s more, while a vast array of state organisations have been charged with selling off their land to the private sector few have kept comprehensive records. This, perhaps, shouldn’t surprise us. The underlying pattern of land ownership in Britain has always been weirdly opaque, with no mandatory and centralised registration of title as there is in other countries. You don’t have to be a conspiracy theorist to see something sinister in this: Britain’s landlords are blatantly accorded more political power than the dispossessed. Christophers estimates that a quarter of currently sitting MPs are landlords of one sort or another, and avers that the most radical measure introduced by the Blair government was undoubtedly the abolition of the hereditary peers’ right to sit in the House of Lords, because this represented the last overt linkage between ownership and suffrage. But then casting a vote isn’t the only way of making the political weather – Christophers tellingly observes: “There is a clear symmetry or alignment between input (lobbying) and output (land privatisation and its beneficiaries) that is impossible to ignore or dispute.”Land and power have been inextricably bound up with each other throughout British history, certainly since William of Normandy claimed ownership of the entire landmass by right of conquest. We can see the attenuation of monarchical and aristocratic power writ into law in the form of successive Reform Acts, which lowered the property requirement for suffrage – see it also in the large scale acquisitions of public land that began with the first world war, then continued throughout the 20th century, up until the Thatcherite climacteric.If their justification for the big sell‑off was to invoke the “hidden hand” of the market as an agent of greater efficiency – both as an exploiter of the land’s resources, and as a means of signalling optimal investment opportunities – then the Thatcherites really didn’t know their Adam Smith. Christophers, by contrast, quotes gleefully from The Wealth of Nations: “As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where never they sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce.”An arch-liberal of the 19th century, John Stuart Mill, was yet more pointed: the landlords “grow richer, as it were, in their sleep, without working, risking or economising. What claim have they, on the general principle of social justice, to this accession of riches?”So acute was Smith’s diagnosis of the problems associated with a market in land – namely, monopoly practices, followed inevitability by price volatility – that Christophers observes there could have been no Marx without him. (And it’s worth recalling that the first demand made in The Communist Manifesto is for the nationalisation of all land.) Far from private landowners utilising land more efficiently, and thereby boosting the overall economy, Christophers demonstrates that privatisation leads to the inversion of the so-called “tragedy of the commons” (the idea that if a community shares the ownership of something, nobody bothers to maintain it), because in their pursuit of the highest possible rents they restrict everyone else’s opportunity to enjoy social amenities. Taking the long view, it’s easy to see that the privatisation of public land since 1979 has heralded the beginning of the end of public space itself – if by that is meant the civic and rural spaces enjoyed by a notional “public”.Christophers isn’t the only one to have addressed these troubling developments – more than a decade ago, Anna Minton’s Ground Control offered a prescient view of the impact of neoliberalism on urban space and the sell-off of Britain’s once enviable stock of public housing has been well catalogued by James Meek in Private Island. Christophers points out that the most valuable element of a council property is usually the ground it stands on – as it is with many other properties: and this is because permission to build remains extant. There were measures in the past to ensure that the increased value of land zoned for construction would be shared by all – the so-called “betterment” levy, enshrined in the 1947 Planning Act – but the landlord interest soon saw to its abolition. In its place we have instead the land-banking practised by the so-called “big six” British house builders, as they drip-feed the market with a view to maximising their shareholders’ profits.• The New Enclosure is published by Verso.

It began at about 4am on Thursday, according to the website DownDetector.O2, which has about 25 million UK customers, said that voice calls were still working but advised people to seek out wifi if they needed to get online while the outage persisted.“We’d encourage our customers to use wifi wherever they can and we apologise for the inconvenience caused,” said an O2 spokesman.The company said that the problem stemed from a global software issue at a third-party supplier, understood to be Ericsson, which has also affected other mobile operators around the world.“We’re aware that our customers are unable to use data this morning,” said a spokesman for O2, which is owned by the Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica.“One of our third-party suppliers has identified a global software issue in their system which has impacted us. We believe other mobile operators around the world are also affected. Our technical teams are working with their teams to ensure this is fixed as quickly as possible.”In total, about 31 million mobile phone users have been affected as a number of third-party mobile providers that rely on the O2 network, including Tesco Mobile, Sky Mobile, Lycamobile and O2’s Giffgaff have also been affected.The outage has also affected services such as Transport for London’s live updates of bus arrival times at stops across the capital, which relies on O2’s network for data updates.In October, O2 apologised for a major network outage affecting customers across the UK.

As part of that package, it was ordered to pay £65m back to customers and castigated by the regulator, Ofwat, for its failure to tackle leaks.Steve Robertson, the chief executive, said the company had been hit, within six months, by “the two most extreme weather events in its history”. Without them, the company would be on target. Looking ahead to next year, he said: “If we had another ‘beast from the east’ and another really hot summer it would be a real struggle.”Attempting to fix leaks more quickly to avoid further penalties, the company said it had installed 26,987 leak-detecting acoustic loggers and installed a further 44,105 smart water meters, which can help pinpoint leaks. It also hired 600 extra full-time engineers and customer service staff, on top of its 6,000-strong workforce.A new billing system will be rolled out from next week, which will allow the company to offer more tailored social tariffs to those who need them.However, pollution incidents rose to 217 in the six-month period, from 202 a year earlier.Robertson said the firm hoped to develop a new sewer depth monitor prototype with its partners within 12 to 18 months to help prevent leaks and install 200,000 of these devices within the next six to seven years. It plans to invest £11.7bn between 2020 and 2025 in its infrastructure and customer service.Last year, Thames Water was fined a record £20.3m after huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames and its tributaries and on to land, which killed birds and fish.Thames Water said it would not pay any idends to shareholders until 2020-21 before resuming payments of £20m a year between 2020 and 2025.The company also said its Cayman Islands entities were close to being shut.The decision to close them formed part of a major shakeup of the business that included the arrival of a new chairman and new pension fund investors, after Australian investment bank Macquarie sold its final stake.Thames Water has paid no corporation tax for a decade because its payments are deferred while it makes major investments in infrastructure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/533bfe37651249e9660963cb8f100d42186b7ab2/0_301_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8972a69e0ad8169c787de0f497483a9f","title":"two tesco directors cleared of false accounting","story":"Crown court jury instructed to acquit duo over the £250m black hole in profits in 2014Former Tesco directors Chris Bush and John Scouler have been cleared of false accounting at Southwark crown court.The court case related to an alleged hole in Tesco’s accounts revealed in September 2014 when the company told the stock market it had overestimated profits by about £250m. The announcement wiped £1.5bn off the value of Tesco in one day.The case’s failure represents an embarrassment for the Serious Fraud Office which is thought to have spent more than £10m, including investigation and legal fees covering two lengthy trials, pursuing the former Tesco senior managers.Judge Sir John Royce instructed the jury to acquit both defendants. Scouler, previously Tesco’s UK food commercial director, and former UK managing director Bush, had each been prosecuted by the SFO on one count of fraud and false accounting.The Judge ruled last week that there was no case to answer and that he would direct the jury to acquit the defendants. The SFO appealed against the ruling.On Wednesday, the court of appeal refused the SFO leave to appeal and reporting restrictions were lifted on Thursday morning after the jury at Southwark were given their instructions.Scouler’s lawyer, Richard Sallybanks of BCL Solicitors, said: “We are delighted that Mr Scouler leaves court today knowing that the judge, having heard the entirety of the prosecution evidence, reached the firm conclusion that he had no case to answer.“We have long argued that the SFO’s prosecution of Mr Scouler was fundamentally flawed, that he should not have been charged, and that the SFO should not have proceeded with this trial. Mr Scouler has maintained since the outset of this investigation that he was not guilty of fraud and false accounting, and those close to him always knew that to be the case.“We are simply pleased that, after four years, this has now been confirmed by the court of appeal upholding the judge’s decision that he should be acquitted of all charges. This is a very significant defeat for the SFO – and a notable win for BCL Solicitors and the two ex Tesco directors.”The retrial started in October after the previous trial, which had run to 18 weeks, was abandoned in February when one of the defendants was taken ill. Bush and Scouler were each charged with one count of fraud and one of false accounting.It was claimed the men were aware that income from suppliers that should have been recognised in future years was recorded early to help the company hit targets and make Tesco look financially stronger than it was.The SFO’s case relied heavily on whistleblower Amit Soni, a senior accountant within Tesco’s finance team who was concerned with the way income from suppliers was being handled. But the SFO did not directly interview any Tesco buyers or suppliers or call them as witnesses in the trial.The loss of the high-profile case is likely to prompt criticism of the SFO, which has previously suffered a string of high-profile failures including the 2016 collapse of a trial of five brokers accused of helping the convicted trader Tom Hayes to rig the Libor rate.It has also been slated for the inept handling of the prosecution of property tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz which led to him winning millions in damages and a public apology after the case was thrown out.Tesco’s management team led by chief executive Dave Lewis is also likely to face scrutiny. The supermarket has already paid the SFO a £129m fine and further legal costs as part of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) relating to false accounting at Tesco Stores Limited, a subsidiary of the retailer, between February and September 2014. At the time it said the agreement was not an admittance by the company that it or any of its employees committed a criminal offence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166ae58707500784277752697bc905504a511d5e/0_167_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=724bf73546b7976964138ab720a446c2","title":"bostons miracle how free nappies and a little mentoring are curbing","story":"The dramatic success of an initiative designed to forestall violence in US cities is gaining worldwide attentionStacy Spell is trying to save lives. The 20-odd youngsters ranged in a semicircle in front of him are healthy enough. But most are on a path towards early death.“If any one of you drops a body, your whole group will be targeted,” Spell booms, pacing the room like a public defender in a courtroom. “Even if you weren’t there, we will come after you.”The youths don’t move. All have criminal records. Most sit slumped in their chairs. One man with big, brown eyes wears his jacket with the collar so high that the zipper reaches his nose. His hands are buried deep in his pockets.“Take this message back to the barber shop, take it back to the club, take it back to your crew,” says Spell, a former homicide detective in New Haven, Connecticut, who is now part of a programme with a very different take on crime and punishment.Today, Kennedy’s team at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York supports more than 30 American cities. New Haven first tested GVI in 2012. The year before, there were 349 shots fired in the town of 130,000, and 27 people died. In 2017 it was 110 shots, killing six people.The success of GVI has been such that European countries are starting to take note. This session was attended by police officers from Malmo, Sweden, who are interested in following suit. Glasgow has established its own variant of GVI, offering young men a way out of crime through education, training and mentoring – delivered by people with experience of street violence.London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, recently announced an anti-violence unit modelled on Glasgow’s in a bid to curb knife crime.“We are eager to try,” says Glen Sjögren, Malmo’s police commissioner. “If we can make the shootings go down we can regain trust in the community. Our biggest problem today is that no one dares to testify.” He hopes Malmo’s success will inspire other Swedish cities to adopt the strategy.The GVI strategy is based around “call-ins” like the one Spell was addressing: a gathering of law enforcement officials, locals, former gang members, and young men attending as part of their probation or parole.Spell gives the men a stark choice. Stop the violence and a whole range of assistance will come their way: nappies for the kids, the right paperwork for a job, even help with relocation to get out of the damaging environment in which they live. Carry on, and prison awaits – or worse.Relatives and representatives of local services also attend. At the New Haven meeting, one social services coordinator, Letitia Charles, pointed at the audience as she asked the young men: “Have you ever heard it takes a village (to raise a child)? Look around you. You have a village.”The dialogue approach is based on carrots and sticks. The police also use peer pressure dynamics in criminal gangs to reach all members, not just the iniduals present at the call-in.Anthony Campbell, the chief of police, tells them he doesn’t want to attend another funeral. Lieutenant Herb Johnson presents some of the intelligence police have on a couple of local gangs. On a board, he shows the faces of some young criminals. “Sentenced to 20 years in prison”, reads a caption under one of them.Among the victims in 2011 was Sean Reeves’s son. He was hit in the neck by a stray bullet during a sudden street fight he never turned 16. Reeves attends the call-in to talk about the pain he awakens to each morning. Reeves himself once lived the criminal life at the age of 21 he lost his best friend to the streets.“I had women, jewellery and cars,” he says. “But I also missed the birth of my first daughter, my son’s first baseball game and my parents’ death.”After his speech, he says it’s impossible to reach them all: “To me, it’s about reaching one.”Last year, Kennedy’s team started to spread their research to Europe and Central America. Juárez, one of the world’s deadliest cities due to drug cartel wars, is among three Mexican cities implementing GVI. Police in El Salvador, seeking a way to handle Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13, a brutal gang wreaking havoc there, are also interested.At the end of the meeting, Spell gives each attendees his business card and shakes them by the hand. He tells them to call anytime.Almost a decade ago, Ducamel “Duke” Denis, 32, received a business card from Risco Mention-Lewis – now the city’s deputy police commissioner, everybody calls her Ms Lewis – at a call-in on Long Island, New York. They still talk at least once a week.Duke joins a regular support group at a resource centre run by Lewis. They get their coffee from 7-Eleven and sit on folding chairs. Lewis and her co-workers know everybody by name.Duke was arrested for the first time at the age of 16, in 2002. When he walked into the call-in in 2009, then called Operation Ceasefire, he was on probation for stolen property and gang assault and had done some prison time.“I knew I never wanted to go back. When they showed me everything they knew, I thought I was either going to be the best criminal I can ever be or quit. And I remember they said: ‘We don’t want to lock you up.’”Arrested in the past, Duke knew the police officers who were there.“I hated them back then. I don’t hate them any more.”Today he is working, studying and has his own photography business. He got into a couple of bad situations after the call-in, but calls it “the eye-opener”.He grew up with six sisters and his parents orced when he was a teenager. He quickly joined one of the local gangs in Long Island. Reminders are everywhere he still has a bullet in his lower back from when a rival gang “decided to go hunting”. Even now, he still bumps into former rivals sometimes. “You build bad blood with people. They view you as the person you were. I still remember when they did something to my family and brought tears to my eyes. Some people probably don’t think I deserve to live.”He drums his fingers at the table when he talks about his past, like he is impatient to change the subject. He admits he used to be tempted to go back to his former life for money, adrenaline and respect “to feed my ego”. These days, people rarely freeze when he walks into a supermarket.“But my kids care that I’m there,” he says with a smile that appears every time he talks about his son and two daughters.“I feel like a get a new chance every single day.”Additional reporting by Libby Brooks in EdinburghFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3e10dc432f91911d7f7d85ba092dbe36c0e4659/0_385_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=656fd1e39dd4da7c68707e24eaabceb0","title":"down with studentification how cities fought for their right not to party","story":"From Bristol to Nottingham, university towns across the country are facing up to the negative impacts of large student populationsIt’s 1.30am on a Sunday in Redland, Bristol, and a student party is in full swing. A front door opens and a young woman comes out dressed as a frog. But this isn’t your average slice of uni mayhem: immediately, the student hired to act as doorman darts forward with a finger to his lips. In the street, departing guests whisper while they wait for their Ubers.Their unusually considerate approach to late-night noise is based on fear of a large fine and disciplinary action from their university, which recently started cracking down, largely in response to the work of one local man. Andrew Waller started his campaigning website the Noise Pages in March this year after a rash of professionally organised student parties shattered the peace in this tight-knit neighbourhood.“When I went to remonstrate with the students, they were very in-my-face,” he says. “They knew they were breaking the university’s rules, and they were happy to tell me they didn’t care. They actually turned the music up.”With the police refusing to step in, and the university and council initially slow to act, Waller was “tipped over into activism”, he says. The Noise Pages now collates residents’ complaints about everything from loud midnight conversations to window-rattling dusk-till-dawn blowouts. Sample posts include: “This morning I had to sluice vomit from my front path,” and “I am literally being driven from my home by this specific problem.”The term “studentification” – coined by the academic Darren Smith in 2002 – refers to the impact student bodies have on the cities around them. For all the vibrancy a large influx brings to a local culture and economy, the indirect consequences can be profound: family homes make way for buy-to-let HMOs (houses of multiple occupancy), bars and fast-food outlets replace primary schools, and “street blight” takes hold as properties lie unkempt and deserted outside of term-time.Waller’s Chandos neighbourhood, bounded by Chandos Road and Waverley Road – aka “Raverley Road” – has the densest concentration of HMOs in Bristol, and is home to some 800 students. “They will frequently tell me: ‘This is a student area – you shouldn’t be surprised that we’re noisy,’” he says. “Sometimes they’ll go a step further and say: ‘Well, if noise bothers you, why don’t you move?’”With the number of full-time students in the UK having doubled since 1992, uni towns across the country are facing up to the “hollowing-out” effects of HMO densification. Councils including Oxford, Birmingham and Leeds have acted to restrict HMOs, as have Nottingham and Bristol, both of which are planning more purpose-built student accommodation. But whether undergrads will voluntarily opt to spend their second and third years in halls is another story: in TV shows from Fresh Meat to The Young Ones (which was shot in Bristol), the first student house, all mismatched sofas and unapproachable sink, is seen as a rite of passage.“We’ve definitely got our work on in terms of that,” says Piper. Waller, meanwhile, thinks “ghettoisation” in purpose-built accommodation would just store up problems for the future. “I would actually prefer to have students in the community,” he says, “just with a better set of rules.”Short of structural reform, what’s the best way to make students into better neighbours? One route is through deterrents. Nottingham’s two universities handed out 1,037 punishments last year for antisocial behaviour alone, while Bristol recently raised its maximum fines for such behaviour to £250 and launched an awareness course that uses victim statements to teach offenders about the impact of their late-night antics.Whether these pleas for unity are getting across is another question. In Bristol, Waller’s website has caused consternation among students who feel they are being targeted simply for having fun. “It’s always hard to tell with these people, isn’t it?” said one student who did not wish to be named. “At first you think they have a point, and then they complain another 1,500 times and you’re thinking, are you making this up?”To remedy the situation, the university now funds a police patrol on weekends and big nights such as Halloween, while every first-year student attends a compulsory talk about being a good “ambassador”. Then there’s the Best Neighbour on Campus award, which recognises considerate households, and voluntary litter-picks. An end-of-term project called Leave Newcastle Happy raised £125,000 in unwanted goods for the British Heart Foundation last year.Marc Lintern, Newcastle University’s director of student experience, says the sight of undergrads giving something back has helped break down residents’ mistrust: “Part of it is about tidying up, and part of it is about the residents getting to know the students so they don’t see them as alien creatures.”If universities are anxious to set a good example for students, they could do worse than soften their own sometimes remote and inaccessible images within cities – perhaps by opening their facilities to the public. San Jose University in the US did just that, co-funding the renovation of a library in which students and the community could read side-by-side. UK universities including Oxford Brookes and the University of Hertfordshire welcome the public into their libraries, but most stop short of borrowing rights.In fact, the US is the leader in the increasingly professionalised field of town-gown relations. Its International Town and Gown Association, established in 2008, now has a UK arm, which last week held its biennial conference at Queen’s University Belfast. Vice-chancellors, police officers, student union representatives, city officials and academics – including Darren Smith of “studentification” fame – were present to compare notes on HMOs, household recycling and student safety.Conference coordinator, Poppy Humphrey, who works as off-campus student affairs officer for Manchester Student Homes – which handles community liaison for both University of Manchester and Manchester politan – says that coming together is crucial for workers in a comparatively new area: “It was important to hear that what we experience in Manchester, our colleagues in other towns and cities do as well.” She says the biggest challenge she and her peers face is the transient nature of the student body: “You’re not dealing with a static group of people – it’s a new cohort each time. But it also means that each year we can develop and grow and try new ideas.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08269dc241b0d12ab14b967388062d8955d7f6cb/0_574_4372_2623/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51ab63e9e43cc4d37f4b8f6dadcdc0c1","title":"rios squatter communities turn derelict buildings into homes in pictures","story":"As the city’s homeless population has grown, squatting projects have become more organised in an attempt to secure abandoned houses as homes for the poor.

This is where the phrase “turn a blind eye” is said to have originated. However, future idioms may not have such a colourful story of origin, thanks to those arguing we should rephrase those that mention meat and animals into anodyne, plant-based phrases.The animal rights group Peta says that many common phrases in the English language perpetuate violence toward animals. The organisation caused a stir when it argued on Twitter that phrases such as “bring home the bacon” trivialise cruelty to animals, going so far as to compare such phrases to using racist, homophobic or ableist language. Peta encourages us to swap our linguistic assaults for phrases such as “bring home the bagels”, “take the flower by the thorn”, and “feed a fed horse” instead of “flog a dead horse” (which still sounds cruel to be honest). Peta isn’t the first to make this suggestion – a Reddit thread going back to 2015 offered suggestions for “veganised” idioms. But this time it coincides with a tribunal that will decide if veganism is akin to a religion, and therefore proponents can be discriminated against, after a vegan worker was sacked for misconduct.These are precarious times for veganism. Some of the most obvious changes have happened across supermarkets and restaurants, which have quickly responded to a shift in eating behaviours. But while it’s in everyone’s interest for the pattern to continue (I’m a veggie striving to be a vegan), there is a chance that the pace could slow – or worse, go into reverse. For a cause like this to have longevity, we need solid arguments effectively communicated. Slow and steady change is for the best: there is a mountain of research arguing we can’t scare or guilt people into making positive change for the planet.The chance that idioms such as “kettle of fish” may offend vegans is not an argument grounded in evidence or common sense. It suggests people aren’t capable of distinguishing a neutral phrase embedded in the English language, used to communicate a complex idea in a colourful and efficient way, from something genuinely offensive. And a comparison to racist language, and the structural problems that enables, is downright offensive.Shareena Hamzah, a researcher at Swansea University, argued in an article for The Conversation earlier this week that increased awareness in veganism will be reflected in language, but that may take some time. It also points out that not all vegans would welcome this change, given the rise of “bloody burgers”, which suggests the cultural associations we have with meat may stick around long after our diets have shifted. British English is littered with nonsensical phrases inspired from a variety of places and eras. Each one offers a mini time capsule that reflects how we used to live. To take just one example, to have one’s head in the clouds is suggestive of a time when aviation was unfathomable. Suggesting we can purposefully change our language not only seeks to eradicate our omnivorous history, it also hints at a chicken-and-eggjackfruit-and-scrambled-tofu debate. On the whole, culture precedes language change, not the other way round.When it comes to idioms, we can’t just go cold Tofurky – they’re ingrained in our language, for better or for worse. Attempting to abruptly change them would do more harm than good. Even Hamzah’s reasonable observations received backlash online, suggesting there is still a lot of reputational damage that needs mending, and a lot of work to be done untangling the negative associations linked with veganism – the stereotypes of being moralistic and militant – which tarnish the good-humoured vegan majority.This campaign only serves to reinforce those negative impressions. While veganism is the most effective change we can make as iniduals towards reducing our carbon footprint, there are much bigger fish to fry than veganising idioms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0a02141cfe7d8f4d3d224814c01df0e03ef7e6b/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5d463b2c0f8d901b1073fe61e5394f","title":"the uk drag scene is too diverse for rupaul to turn into a race for ratings","story":"The all-American TV series Drag Race risks sanitising and distorting our gloriously messy, non-binary communityRuPaul’s Drag Race, the ever-expanding empire, is now making its way over to the UK. After years of rumours and promises, the British version has finally found a home on BBC Three, and will arrive to us at some point next year. While this has the potential to showcase the ersity of the British drag scene, I’m worried it will exclude underrepresented voices in the community.Drag Race has undeniably done great work in whetting the mainstream appetite for drag, giving drag queens around the world a platform and well-deserved visibility. That LGBT audiences worldwide have a show like Drag Race on a mainstream platform is not to be dismissed. As a drag queen myself, it is still one of the only TV shows that speaks to me. But it does not represent the drag that I do, or the drag that I have come to find so powerful in this country.Drag Race has always privileged cisgender male queens. A trans woman may have been runnerup last year, but the show is structurally designed to celebrate men dressing up as women, unashamed of its repeated catchphrase: “Gentlemen, start your engines, and may the best woman win!” Earlier this year, RuPaul himself argued that drag is at its best when it is men doing it, saying, “drag loses its sense of danger and its sense of irony once it’s not men doing it, because at its core it’s a social statement and a big F-you to male-dominated culture. So for men to do it, it’s really punk rock, because it’s a real rejection of masculinity.” He later apologised for causing offence.Contrary to mass-cultural notions about drag, it is just as potent, if not more so when transgender identities, non-binary people and women do it too. The UK performers who inspire me most are nearly never cisgender men, and create work that would not readily operate within the current Drag Race model. One of the country’s most prolific drag queens, Victoria Sin, is an assigned-female-at-birth non-binary artist whose work – which recently exhibited at the Hayward Gallery – asks critical questions about the way images of femininity are produced and consumed. The inclusivity of such perspectives is the beating heart of the UK community –a UK Drag Race might erase the erse voices at its core. And the problems that causes go far beyond simple visibility. The demand for queens who have competed on the show will rise, as will their booking fees, and one wonders what that will do to drag performers who don’t want or can’t have access to the show. Chiyo Gomes, a trans Afrolatinx Drag Princx, says: “I’m wary as someone whose entire income is based on drag. The disparities this show could cause in terms of how money becomes designated among the cabaret scene is daunting … Will our value as performers fall depending on whether or not we’ve been on the show?” Drag Race is now an economy – and like all capitalist systems, inherent within it is the exclusion of many.The show notoriously celebrates queens who display pageantry and high production values in their runway looks – it’s an all-American outlook. Every year, comedy queens who have competed have been critiqued for cheaper costumes, with punk queen Adore Delano reduced to tears on All Stars 2 for wearing something “basic”. Notwithstanding that the aesthetic expectations of Drag Race are economically exclusive for most, well produced looks are not what the UK drag scene prides itself on. Author and non-binary drag queen Tom Rasmussen explains: “A lot of the UK’s very best drag can be found in basement bars where it rejects notions of assimilation into oppressive capitalistic structures, and therefore the polish which a show like RuPaul’s Drag Race venerates is at odds with a lot of contemporary drag, as well as UK drag’s basis in working-class, regional culture.” Messiness is an intentional, political decision for many drag performers – Drag Race UK must make sure not to look down on this.The most important thing I’ve found in drag is community – it brings LGBT people together. I’ve always loathed Drag Race’s unashamed focus on the inidual winning. Competition and animosity between the contestants is encouraged, and doesn’t reflect the togetherness at the foundation of the community. London drag performers like ShayShay have worked tirelessly to create inclusive spaces for drag performers of colour, for instance, as have institutions like The Cocoa Butter Club and Gomes’s show WOOF, which, Chiyo says, “showcase bodies that wouldn’t be allowed to do drag according to RuPaul’s logic”.And so I ask of RuPaul this: please be careful. This UK venture might just be an extension of your monopoly, but it has the risk of iding up our community, and erasing many of our experiences. We’ve worked hard to build our safe spaces. Don’t take them away from us. Ensure that every decision you make going forward respects the ersity of the UK drag community, not only the whims of your show and its ratings. This isn’t just TV – this is our lives.• Amrou Al-Kadhi is a British-Iraqi writer, drag performer, and filmmaker.

Speakers included white supremacists and a researcher who has previously advocated child rape.Toby Young, the head of the government-backed New Schools Network, stepped down as director of the new Office for Students shortly after it was revealed that he had attended the last of these conferences in May 2017.The university, which was unaware of the existence of these meetings, has now severed all links with Thompson, as well as tightening up its room-booking systems.Thompson declined to comment this week, but wrote in a recent blog that he had been forced to keep the UCL meetings secret because speakers were worried that discussions about “group differences” could face “hostile interruptions and damage their careers”. He also argued that “scientific truths” about racial difference could not be deemed racist.But UCL’s links with eugenics started long before these conferences. Sir Francis Galton, the Victorian scientist who is known as the father of eugenics, left his personal collection and archive to the university, as well as an endowment that funded the country’s first professorial chair of eugenics.The new inquiry will question whether buildings should still be named after Galton and other leading eugenicists.UCL’s students’ union wants Galton’s name stripped from a lecture theatre and a laboratory. It is campaigning for all of the university’s teaching materials to be “decolonised”.Mahmud Rahman, the union’s democracy, operations and community officer, welcomed the inquiry and said: “UCL’s history in relation to eugenics is deeply troubling for us and our members.”UCL’s president, Prof Michael Arthur, said the university had decided to examine its historical links to eugenics because the issue “causes considerable concern among many members of our community”.He added: “We both hear and recognise the sensitivities around eugenics – particularly surrounding the work of Francis Galton – and we look forward to receiving the panel’s recommendations.”But academics outside UCL stressed that the inquiry must not be used as a sticking plaster to avoid addressing bigger issues about racial equality on campus.Kalwant Bhopal, professor of education and social justice at Birmingham University, said: “I think it’s hugely important for universities to acknowledge their past actions, but it must lead to some real change, rather than simply being rhetoric.”Pratik Chakrabarti, professor of the history of science, technology and medicine at Manchester University, said: “I feel just having a go at Galton or the eugenic past of UCL is not terribly effective, unless we link these questions to what is happening with the great class and race ide in our society.”Meanwhile, some scientists are horrified that Galton, whose other contributions to science included creating psychometric testing and the statistical concept of correlation, might be erased from UCL.Niall McCrae, a senior lecturer in mental health nursing at King’s College London, said: “Galton was one of the greatest British scientists of all time, who put psychology on a proper scientific footing. You’ve got to understand the figure in the context of the time in which he was working. To link him with the Nazis is an horrific sentimentalist slur.”He added: “Nowadays in universities there is a culture of completely overturning people who were once celebrated.”Iyiola Solanke, professor of EU law and social justice at Leeds University, will lead the inquiry. It will report next summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

His social media presence has also been a major key to his success with 34 million followers on Twitter and over 65 million on Instagram and with ratings for the ceremony continuing to spiral down, the Academy clearly hopes he’ll help draw viewers back in.After two years of straight white host Jimmy Kimmel’s rather dull shtick and after an increased push to improve the ersity of voters, choosing an African American host is also a much-needed leap forward on stage.But there’s one small catch.Hart has a rather vile history of documented homophobia, ranging from offensive standup clangers to dumb interview statements to puerile tweets to a whole embarrassing film filled with it. In 2010 during his Seriously Funny standup special, Hart delivered an extended joke based on a fear of his three-year-old son Hendrix turning out gay.One of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay. That’s a fear. Keep in mind, I’m not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, be happy. Do what you want to do. But me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will. Now with that being said, I don’t know if I handled my son’s first gay moment correctly. Every kid has a gay moment but when it happens, you’ve got to nip it in the bud!As his profile rose, the joke resurfaced and in a 2015 profile with Rolling Stone, he was asked to discuss it. After attempting a poorly conceived justification claiming that it’s really all about his own fears and insecurities, he then blamed the climate.“I wouldn’t tell that joke today, because when I said it, the times weren’t as sensitive as they are now,” he said. “I think we love to make big deals out of things that aren’t necessarily big deals, because we can.”What might not seem like a big deal to Hart is less amusing when given a wider context. In his extended joke, he claimed to have beaten both his son and another kid who was “grinding” up behind him at a party, something that feels particularly grotesque when viewed next to the multiple real world stories of parents beating and torturing their children to death when a so-called “gay moment” rears its head. Giovanni Melton, Gabriel Fernandez, Anthony Avalos, Ronnie Paris – just a handful of kids killed by parents because of either their perceived or confirmed homosexuality.During the same period, Hart revealed that he turned down a role in 2008’s Tropic Thunder because the character was gay and his behaviour was “real flagrant” before adding that he’d never be able to play a gay character in the future. “What I think people are going to think while I’m trying to do this is going to stop me from playing that part the way I’m supposed to,” he said.The comments preceded his role opposite Will Ferrell in Get Hard, one of the most shockingly regressive gay panic comedies in recent memory, an almost two-hour film based around a fear of anal sex. In the film, Hart helps Ferrell’s character prepare for a stint in jail but after minimal attempts to cover the specifics of prison life and protecting one’s self in a fight, a strikingly dominant phobia of male rape takes over. I wrote about it at the time:The film’s unarguably wretched low point arrives when Hart’s character takes Ferrell to a gay brunch “hookup spot” where he tells him he’ll need to learn to perform oral sex to make his time in prison easier. While being eyed up by every gay man around them, Hart informs Ferrell of the relative ease of approaching a gay stranger for sex, because “that’s what they do”. After Ferrell immediately gets the attention of the depressingly used Matt Walsh, of Veep fame, he proceeds to attempt an unsuccessful bathroom-stall tryst, which disgusts him in such graphic detail that he can’t go through with it. Meanwhile, Hart is approached by a predatory older gay man who, even after finding out Hart’s heterosexuality, refuses to take no for an answer.Now, there’s an important distinction to make here. The fear of rape is obviously legitimate and a man’s fear of being raped by another man while in prison is also understandable and by no means homophobic. It makes sense that the film would at least address this but what makes less sense is why the writers have such an obsession with the idea. It punctuates every other line of dialogue and not even in particularly inventive ways (the script is essentially multiple, exhaustive variations on “you’re going to get raped”).Hart’s response to criticism, from a gay journalist at the time, was predictably unbothered. “Funny is funny, regardless of what area it’s coming from,” he said to HitFix\u0027s Louis Virtel. The film was also released just months after The Wedding Ringer, a film described by The AV Club’s AA Dowd as “a 100-minute gay joke”.So why at a time when the Academy is desperate to show a more inclusive side would Hart seem like an appropriate host? Back in 2011, Brett Ratner was removed as Oscars producer for saying “rehearsal is for fags” – a dim-witted use of a word that he shouldn’t be using in the first place but after a quick search of Hart’s Twitter feed, it seems that it also used to be a major part of his vocabulary. Calling someone a “fat faced fag”, comparing a profile picture to a “gay bill board for AIDS” and using the term “no homo” to frequently remind us of his superior heterosexuality. If he’s even made to comment on any of this, I imagine he will use his youth as an excuse but the tweets in question were sent in his early 30s, quite clearly old enough to know the difference between right and bigoted.Hart’s obsession with making unfunny, disrespectful and inappropriate jokes about a community he has shown nothing but bile for along with a string of unrepentant responses to any criticism paints him as someone entirely undeserving of a spot on the Oscars stage. If the Academy wants to progress and remain relevant, handpicking a man with a history of homophobia is a flashing red siren of an issue, a middle finger up to the LGBT community and a sign that Oscars might no longer be quite as white but they remain aggressively straight."},{"url":null,"title":"all is true kenneth branagh shakespeare trailer","story":"Written by Ben Elton, the forthcoming film features Branagh as the playwright in his retirement years, opposite Judi Dench as Anne HathawayThe first trailer for Kenneth Branagh’s “Shakespeare in retirement” drama All Is True has been released.Branagh directs the film, as well as playing Shakespeare, living in retirement with his wife Anne Hathaway (Judi Dench) and grappling with a number of personal crises – including the death of his son Hamnet and the destruction of the Globe theatre in a fire.Branagh has previously made five big-screen adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays, including his directorial debut, Henry V, as well as In the Bleak Midwinter, about a community production of Hamlet.

The films were poles apart in style and subject matter, and the process of completing one while shooting the other left the director exhausted and emotionally ragged. In spring 1993, Spielberg was in Poland, recreating the terror of the Kraków ghetto and the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp for Schindler’s List by day, and each night he was calling Industrial Light \u0026amp Magic in California to oversee the special effects for the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Spielberg’s friend Robin Williams would call him up once a week to tell him jokes for 15 minutes at a time and release the tension.Spielberg pulled off a similar double recently when he shot political drama The Post in the midst of post-production for blockbuster spectacle Ready Player One. With Schindler’s List in 1993, Spielberg couldn’t bear the thought of delaying the production of his Holocaust passion project for another year. With The Post, he felt that the story’s resonances with the current political climate were too urgent to wait. Likewise, the trailer for the 25th anniversary re-release of Schindler’s List rings with the words “Now more than ever”.By 1993, Schindler’s List had been on Spielberg’s desk for a decade. He was first given a copy of Thomas Keneally’s book after completing ET the Extra-Terrestrial in 1982. Keneally’s book is a novelized version of a true story: how German industrialist and Nazi named Oskar Schindler managed to save 1,200 Jews from transportation to concentration camps. It’s a gruelling tale, and Schindler is not a conventional hero. He sets out as a profiteer, buying a former Jewish business in the Kraków ghetto, and exploiting Jewish labour to make enamelware to sell to the German army. As the war continues, Schindler can no longer stomach the regime and is moved to save a group of Polish Jews from the gas chambers. It’s a brave and righteous act, but one that pales in comparison to the scope of the Nazi atrocity. Nevertheless, a title card at the end of Spielberg’s adaptation informs that in 1993, as a result of the Shoah, there were only 4,000 Jews living in Poland, but around the world, there were more than 6,000 descendants of the Jews saved by Schindler. As is also shown in the film, the men and women that Schindler protected present him with a ring inscribed with words from the Talmud: “Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.”Spielberg shot his adaptation for a comparatively small budget of around $22m (about a third of the cost of Jurassic Park), in black-and-white, and in 72 days. Schindler was played by Liam Neeson, then a little-known actor, whom Spielberg has admired in Anna Christie on Broadway. Sir Ben Kingsley played the crucial role of Itzhak Stern, Schindler’s Jewish accountant, who envisages the factory as a sanctuary from the camps long before his employer does. Ralph Fiennes, a relative newcomer at the time, played Amon Göth, the film’s snarling, sadistic villain – a grotesque SS officer who oversees the Płaszów camp, taking pot-shots at the workers from his balcony. The film’s story is as much about Schindler’s moral journey from complacent and mercenary womaniser to compassionate rescuer, from Göth to Stern, as wider Holocaust history. Cinematic flourishes such as picking out the coat of one little girl fleeing the SS in red become the dramatic signposts in this ethical transformation. She is both a lift from Keneally, who describes Schindler breaking down after seeing a girl in red, which gives him a clearer understanding the scope of the Nazi scheme, and a nudge to the viewer, picking out one victim among thousands.Schindler views the girl in red from a distance, when he surveys the liquidation of the ghetto from a hilltop. Along with the bleak dramatic irony common to many war films (the Jews frequently assert that things can’t get worse), one of the film’s dominant strategies is a conscious discretion over the amount of screen violence. First one or two are killed (symbolically, the first is a disabled man, as those with disabilities were first to be targeted by the Nazis) and then more and more, until we are faced with the terrible sight of ash falling like snow across Kraków, a sickening mass grave, and the ferocious Auschwitz chimney. In interviews, Spielberg has discussed certain incidents that were deemed too obscene to be filmed. One of the film’s most gruelling scenes remains the attempted murder of a rabbi, which is thwarted by a jammed mechanism in Göth’s pistol.Schindler’s List is more than three hours long, and with such narrative care in Steve Zaillian’s screenplay, those accomplished lead performances, crisp and carefully lit cinematography by Janusz Kamiński and a sensitive John Williams score (featuring a violin theme by Israeli American soloist Itzhak Perlman it is the definition of prestige cinema). Its sober tone seems to fold the unflinching testimony of Lanzmann’s documentary into the hermetic narrative of a well-crafted novel, subjugating raw authenticity to emotional immediacy and the solace of a redemption story: a tactic that found a wide and generally appreciative audience. Schindler’s List was admiringly reviewed, recouped more than 10 times its budget at the box office and took home seven of the 12 Oscars it was nominated for, including best adapted screenplay, best picture and best director.Before Schindler’s List, Holocaust cinema had been dominated by documentary, most notably Claude Lanzmann’s Shoah and Alain Resnais’s Night and Fog, but after Schindler’s List, it seemed that a raft of narrative features were released, including Life is Beautiful, The Pianist and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. But can a movie really begin to address enormity of the Holocaust? Especially a Hollywood film, and one such as this, which dwells on the heroism of a gentile capitalist, arguably above the suffering of the Jews? Famously, Stanley Kubrick, who had his own never-realised Holocaust project in the works, is said to have been doubtful. “Think that was about the Holocaust?” he reportedly said. “That was about success, wasn’t it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler’s List was about 600 people who don’t.” Still, historian Peter Novick has identified Schindler’s List, together with Shoah and the 1993 opening of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, as key events in the creation of what he calls “Holocaust consciousness”. vNot only does the movie bear witness to the events such as the vicious liquidation of the ghetto, but also becomes a memorial of its own via the controversial coda, in which survivors from Schindler’s factory lay stones on his grave arm-in-arm with the actors who played them.For Spielberg, telling Schindler’s story was a tool to combat ignorance, but it is work that continues. After making the film, he recorded the testimony of many thousands more Holocaust survivors in a video project called Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation. Keneally himself had first heard about Schindler from one of the men saved, Leopold Page, who would tell his tale to the customers in his Beverly Hills luggage shop, hoping that the word would get out. Via Keneally, and then Spielberg, it reached the widest possible audience – and now the film returns to our screens just when we need to hear this story the most."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95e3bb641cf68e57aeed118253427d9bde6f5daf/33_137_5148_3090/master/5148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=431fa4f1e59e4f053ab72ca3e968e9a0","title":"maurizio sarri chelsea players attitude wolves defeat","story":"• Chelsea concede twice in four minutes to lose 2-1• ‘I am really worried that we didn’t react to their first goal’Maurizio Sarri questioned the attitude of his Chelsea players and accused some of over-confidence after they suffered a chastening 2-1 defeat at Wolves that leaves them 10 points behind Manchester City, the Premier League leaders, before Saturday’s meeting between the two clubs at Stamford Bridge.After taking the lead through Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Chelsea conceded twice in four second-half minutes, with Sarri dismayed at the way his players reacted to Raúl Jiménez’s equaliser. The Italian admitted he was “really worried” by what he had seen thereafter as Wolves turned the game on its head through Diogo Jota’s winner.Sarri made five changes to his starting XI but said that neither his team selection nor a couple of controversial refereeing decisions – Álvaro Morata had a strong penalty appeal turned down and Willian felt he was fouled prior to Wolves scoring their second – came into his thinking when he analysed Chelsea’s performance.“I think it’s more important to talk about our attitude after the first goal,” he said. “We were not the same team as before. So I don’t want to discuss if there was a foul on Willian or not. It’s not important for me. Maybe it was for the result, but not for me. I have to understand why the team was suddenly another team.”Sarri said taking on Pep Guardiola’s side is now a daunting prospect. “For me, City is the best team in Europe and maybe in the world. So the match is difficult for this reason. Of course, after this match, we lost confidence, but maybe it’s better because sometimes my players show me that they have too much confidence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4029329c6ba4f2f87009ee8eb4a214b9df40ec0f/0_63_4807_2884/master/4807.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4f03d5fc8f709c30f66b11cd5a631ac","title":"ralph hasenhuttl alpine klopp southampton manager crazy","story":"Ever since Ralph Hasenhüttl made his debut as a gangly teenage striker for his hometown club Grazer, he has forged a career out of being patient. The first Austrian to manage in the Premier League was signed by Austria Vienna in 1988 as a replacement for Toni Polster, who had been sold to Torino the previous season for £1.2m, and went on to win three successive titles and earn an international call-up.But nagging injuries and the presence of poster boy and part-time pop star Polster meant that Hasenhüttl, despite scoring three goals in eight appearances for his country, missed out on selection for the 1990 World Cup and again in 1998, winding down his playing career in Germany, where he lived for two decades until his move to Southampton was confirmed on Wednesday.“He talks more like a German these days than an Austrian,” says Andreas Heidenreich from the Kurier newspaper. “But it’s very good for the country to have our first Premier League manager. He’s very popular in Austria, which is a small country in world football, so people are very proud to see him move to England. He’s a very down to earth and that is the same style as he was when he was a player. He was never fancy – he was very good in the air but had limited chances because he was playing in the same era as Polster.”After playing for Bayern Munich’s reserve side at the end of his career, it was in Bavaria that he was handed a first opportunity in coaching, taking over the youth team at third-tier SpVgg Unterhaching in 2004 before being promoted to the first team three years later. Hasenhüttl was sacked in 2010 and joined VfR Aalen, where he began to develop the gegenpressing style that has brought comparisons to Jürgen Klopp. Both born in the summer of 1967 and they went on the same course to earn their coaching badges, yet whereas Liverpool’s manager was handed his chance by Mainz after retiring in 2001, the ‘Alpine Klopp’ had to do it the hard way.Having taken Aalen to the second ision for the first time, he moved to Ingolstadt in October 2013 and transformed a team threatened with relegation into champions the following season. He left after a successful campaign in the Bundesliga that saw the tiny club finish 11th, taking up the challenge of guiding nouveau riche RB Leipzig through their inaugural season in Germany’s top-flight.Leipzig broke the record for the longest undefeated streak of a promoted team as they finished as runners-up to Bayern and qualified for the Champions League but his time in eastern Germany was brought to a sudden halt in the summer when Hasenhüttl failed to repeat the trick, with the sporting director Ralf Rangnick stepping into his shoes while they await the arrival of Julian Nagelsmann.“I think he also wanted to take the next step – it’s very hard to keep Leipzig in the Champions League every season,” says Heidenreich. “It’s also not so easy to work with Ralf Rangnick ...”With Hasenhüttl having spent two weeks on trial at Chelsea under Glenn Hoddle in the mid-1990s, there was always a sense that the Premier League could be his next destination. “I didn’t really believe that I could sign there but it was fantastic inspiration for my career that I could train there for two weeks,” he said in an interview in 2015. “My talent in playing football was not the highest but I was very hard-working, interested to learn and get better, and this focus made me better and better.”He has certainly applied that approach to management, spending the summer after he left Aalen riding between Borussia Dortmund’s and Borussia Mönchengladbach’s training camps on his mountain bike and spying on their sessions with a pair of binoculars.“It’s better to be incognito because otherwise everyone is talking to you because they know you – and you can’t concentrate on the training because everyone is talking to you,” he explained. “I was also in Italy when Germany were preparing for the World Cup because it was interesting for me. I’m maybe in this way a little bit crazy but it made me a better coach.”Hasenhüttl, a talented piano player, will need to press all the right notes if Southampton are to recover from an awful period that has brought only one home win in the Premier League since November 2017. But if anyone can do it, then it is surely the manager who became known in Germany for his exuberant celebrations.“He expects players to work very hard and is very demanding but is a very positive guy who brings a good atmosphere to his teams,” says Heidenreich. “After the matches, he often cannot sleep and has said that he sometimes stays up all night watching replays.”There may be a few sleepless nights to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/062d5bb80164e3a915d50104204894876fcc0e14/123_179_3198_1919/master/3198.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f0239346c74b57d5a79424738d24ed0","title":"tottenham danny rose playing wembley no longer honour","story":"Danny Rose says it is no longer an honour to play at Wembley, as he laid bare the frustration that he and his Tottenham teammates feel about the club’s delayed new stadium build and their unsatisfactory stop-gap accommodation.Spurs have announced that they will continue to play their home matches at Wembley until at least the end of December – with the suggestion being it could be February before they get into the rebuilt White Hart Lane – and there was a low point on Wednesday night when only 33,012 turned up to see them beat Southampton 3-1 in the Premier League.The club’s previous lowest league attendance at Wembley had been the 43,268 against Cardiff in October. Mauricio Pochettino has said the national stadium can seem empty when it has 50-60,000 inside and against Southampton it was almost eerie at times.“It’s just not nice any more,” Rose said. “It’s lost its … I don’t feel it’s an honour to play at Wembley. We’re all itching to get in the new stadium and hopefully it’s not too much longer.“We’re disappointed it’s taken longer than expected but we know everybody is putting in the hours to make sure the stadium is as good as possible. It’s not that much longer now, so hopefully over the next couple of months we’re going to be in there …“What’s Wembley lost? The atmosphere is a bit flat. I obviously sympathise with the fans, travelling further to come to Wembley, but Wednesday was the lowest attendance since we’ve been at Wembley. That speaks volumes.”Rose made his first start in two months against Southampton, having recovered from a groin injury that took much longer to heal than expected, and he will be needed as the club remain mired in an unforgiving run of fixtures. They will play nine further matches by 5 January.They visit Leicester in the league on Saturday night before going to Barcelona for Tuesday’s make-or-break Champions League group tie.Spurs also have the Carabao Cup quarter-final at Arsenal looming on 19 December, which will provide an early opportunity for revenge after last Sunday’s 4-2 league defeat at the Emirates Stadium. Rose came on as a late substitute in a passionate derby which featured a mass confrontation after Eric Dier’s equaliser for 1-1. Arsenal’s celebratory social media posts afterwards were another talking point.“Me seeing the Arsenal players do that after the game was obviously frustrating and I’m already looking forward to the reverse fixture when we get them at Wembley or the new stadium,” Rose said of the home derby, scheduled for 2 March. “We’ve also got the quarter-final and we’ll be looking to put the result right from the weekend. That’ll be the first chance to win a trophy if we get through that.“I know there were a lot of opinions about Eric’s celebration but that’s what derbies are all about. When we’ve played at the Emirates before, the atmosphere has not been like that. It’s special. As long as we conduct ourselves in a professional manner, I don’t see anything wrong with what happened.“It’s obviously frustrating when you lose and you see selfies and pictures from the changing room being uploaded but there’s our incentive. It shows how far we’ve come in recent years that it looked like it meant a lot to them to get a win over us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b73efb7fe79e98de9f1e01eed9600bad1fa6f79/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=deecdb7276a41c7ea4db36ac847be3c2","title":"paco alcacer striker borussia dortmund bundesliga","story":"No one has scored more goals in the Bundesliga this season than Paco Alcácer, even though he has started just two gamesBy Martin Laurence for WhoScoredThe top of the Bundesliga table has been transformed since the final day of last season. Bayern Munich ended the campaign – and Jupp Heynckes ended his managerial career – with a surprising 4-1 home defeat to Stuttgart, yet they still finished a massive 21 points clear at the top as they won their sixth successive league title. Bayern are now down in fourth, a full nine points behind current leaders Borussia Dortmund.Dortmund have come a long way since that day in May, when they nearly blew their chances of playing in the Champions League this season. When Pavel Kaderabek put Hoffenheim 3-1 up against Dortmund with just over 15 minutes remaining on the final day, Dortmund’s goal difference was just one better than that of Bayer Leverkusen – who were directly below them in the table, level on 55 points each, with a 3-0 lead over Hannover at the time. Had Leverkusen found another goal they could have leapt over Dortmund and into the final Champions League spot, but two late goals from Hannover – in the 94th and the 96th minute – eased Dortmund into fourth.Dortmund needed a new approach this summer and started by ushering manager Peter Stöger out the door. In his place came Lucien Favre, who returned to the country where he had worked wonders with both Hertha Berlin and Borussia Mönchengladbach. The Swiss coach took Hertha Berlin from 10th to fourth in his two years in the capital before saving Borussia Mönchengladbach from relegation in 2011 and securing another fourth-place finish the very next season.Bayern Munich have been unusually frail this season under their new coach, Niko Kovac, and Dortmund have exploited that weakness fully, storming into a seven-point lead at the top of the table, with a nine-point advantage over Bayern. Dortmund’s goal difference of +24 after 13 matches is far by the best in the ision, which suggests they are blowing teams away, but their success is actually based on their ruthless efficiency in front of goal.Their strength is not in creating a lot of chances, but in taking them. Two big wins – their 7-0 thrashing of lowly Nurnberg and their 4-0 victory over Stuttgart – account for almost half of their goal difference. In general, they have not been overly dominant in matches. In fact, they have taken 56 fewer shots than Bayern and just one more than last-place Fortuna Düsseldorf. Dortmund are top of the league because of their tremendous finishing.He was not in the starting line-up for Dortmund on Saturday in their 2-0 victory over Freiburg but, yet again, he came off the bench and scored. That was his ninth goal as a substitute so far this season – enough to break the Bundesliga record in a single season, and all by the first day of December. On top of that, not a single goalkeeper has saved one of his shots this season. If he has hit it on target, it has gone in.So why is Alcácer not starting? After all, Dortmund don’t have another natural No 9 to keep the Spaniard out of the side. Maximilian Philipp has led the line on six occasions this season but he played predominantly from the left flank last season. Even Mario Götze has been picked up front more often than Alcácer in the league this season.Favre’s reluctance to pick his in-form goalscorer is partly due to concerns over his fitness in the past, having spent two years warming the bench at Barcelona. Perhaps the coach is also of the opinion that if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. His team are still unbeaten after 13 games – 10 of which they have won – and, when playing as a substitute, Alcácer is scoring a goal every 21 minutes when including injury time – within which he has now scored three.More than half of Alcácer’s league goals (six of his 10) have come in the 80th minute or later, while his tally has directly earned Dortmund nine points – fittingly, the same number as their lead over Bayern. The summer signing has made the difference for Favre, but he may have to continue to make do with a place on the bench.The striker has the rare problem of being too effective as a substitute to start games. As matches open up, Dortmund’s bright attacking talents are given more space to exploit and Alcácer can come on and be the perfect finisher of both goals and games. He fits the system perfectly at present and, while his statistics will undoubtedly prove unsustainable, the title chasers have no reason to rush their in-form frontman into the starting line-up.• Follow WhoScored on Twitter and Facebook• Follow Martin Laurence on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea3592a99ff7a9c48112cd6fbc6db4e2669847d/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58598f8866a3aa4f6d0930171cf1e072","title":"jamaica lgbt rights activists pride two decades of progress j flag","story":"A country where violence against the LGBT community was once rife is increasingly adopting a more liberal outlookEarly one late summer morning, more than 200 people gathered under the lush canopy of Hope Gardens in Kingston, Jamaica, for a breakfast party.The revellers ate – ackee, saltfish, fried plantain – and swayed to a soundtrack of dancehall and soca.Same-sex couples danced together. A transgender woman strutted by in a flowing white dress adorned with a sash bearing the words: “Miss Supermodel Intl 2018”. The park was strung with rainbow banners for the fourth annual Pride JA celebrations. At about midday, the party wrapped up. A light rain eased the heat and the dancers went home to sleep.It was all a far cry from the country that Time magazine called “the most homophobic place on Earth” in 2006. Yet that label has clung to Jamaica ever since, and with good reason. In a 2013 survey of 71 LGBT people conducted by Human Rights Watch, more than half said they had been victims of homophobic violence. Non-violent discrimination is even more pervasive, with bullying and exclusion faced in education, healthcare and within local communities.The change has come through the dedication of activists, including the work of Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-Flag), the country’s largest LGBT rights organisation, which next month celebrates its 20th anniversary.When the organisation launched on 10 December 1998, it caused outrage. A journalist in the Gleaner wrote at the time: “We are being prepared to accept seeing two men kissing, holding hands or sharing popcorn from the same bucket at the movies. Public reaction has, however, been hostile … for the next few years, at least, gay rights in our society, as far as road marches or public appearances are concerned, is a very dim possibility.”Less than two decades later, J-Flag has made this “dim possibility” slightly brighter. Three years ago, the country held its first pride event when a flashmob of 15 LGBT people gathered in Kingston’s Emancipation Park, dressed in the colours of the rainbow. Since then, pride week has grown: a beach party last year attracted 1,200 people.Pride celebrations have brought unprecedented visibility to the community. So has social media, which has allowed the organisation, and other groups campaigning for LGBT rights, to “humanise” gay people.As a result, the former minister for justice and the mayor of Kingston have both spoken out publicly in support of the group. Policy change has not followed, however. Under the country’s colonial-era “buggery law”, anal sex is criminalised (sharing a legal clause with bestiality), as are acts of intimacy between two men.But attitudes are changing. The first time J-Flag addressed parliament calling for changes to these laws, in 2001, they were not taken seriously or treated with respect. But the second time, in 2017, politicians listened courteously. “That’s a huge step forward,” says Glenroy Murray, former associate director of programmes at the organisation. “People are willing to engage us, have us at the table and listen to our concerns.”Jaevion Nelson, J-Flag’s executive director, says there has been a “public awakening” following two homophobic attacks in 2013 – one of them the murder of Dwayne Jones, who attended a party in women’s clothes. The 16-year-old’s death forced the discussion of LGBT rights into the public sphere.The organisation itself has grown considerably since Nelson joined in 2010, aged 24, when there were just three employees. J-Flag now employs 14, with more than 200 volunteers recruited to help coordinate their growing number of events and activist programmes.But, says Nelson, the lingering Time magazine headline is a hindrance. “It’s an unfair label,” he says, one that ignores the complex realities of discrimination and downplays the emergence of greater tolerance across the country. “It creates a lot of fear in people and paralyses the community. You think of yourself as the next victim of murder, rather than seeing yourself as an inidual with agency.”Before Jamaica could get to that point of tolerance, however, J-Flag activists had to learn to latch on to bigger themes. Their manifesto, the Gay Agenda, was aligned with the government’s Vision 2030 development plan. The organisation works to reduce the spread of HIV across the island, and campaigns for the environment. “We try as best as possible to interrupt our voices in those broader discussions, and not just about LGBT issues, because we exist outside of that community, too,” says Suelle Anglin, J-Flag’s associate director of marketing, communication and engagement.Murray echoes these sentiments. “It’s not about the trajectory of decriminalisation, anti-discrimination legislation and then marriage,” he says. “It’s about looking at the ways in which LGBT people aren’t able to live their best lives.”This means prioritising changes to anti-discrimination laws, which don’t protect Jamaicans on the basis of sexual or gender identity, over the “largely symbolic” repeal of the “buggery” laws.

And she’s made by women paid just 1p for each doll that shimmers off shop shelves.This Christmas, tens of thousands of children the world over will excitedly tear the wrapping paper off an Ariel doll – Disney’s Little Mermaid – secure in the knowledge that it was made for them by Santa’s happy elves at the north pole.The reality would come as a cruel surprise. For elves, read Chinese factory workers. For the north pole, read the city of Heyuan. And for happy, read miserable – from illegally long working hours and exhaustion to wages too low to support a family.An investigation published on Thursday by rights groups Solidar Suisse and China Labor Watch, in partnership with the , found evidence of excessive and illegal overtime, basic pay rates as low as 85p an hour, no holiday or sick pay and high levels of exhaustion among the largely female workforce making toys for Disney, Mattel’s Fisher Price brand and other international toy companies.Workers reported being fined or dismissed if they took three or more days off sick.Staff at the Wah Tung factory in the city of Heyuan said that they worked 175 hours of overtime in a month, with only one day off over that period – both breaches of Chinese labour law and toy industry codes of conduct.Heyuan is a city of roughly 3 million people in Guangdong province, south-east China.It is home to Wah Tung (Heyuan) Toy Manufacturing Ltd, where about 2,000 workers produce a range of mainly plastic toys and electronics.This is where Disney makes the Princess Sing \u0026amp Sparkle Ariel doll that sells for £34.99. Many online stores have sold out of stock and are awaiting a fresh delivery a few days before Christmas.At the peak of production, in late summer, as many as 2,400 of the dolls were rolling off the Wah Tung production line each day.The doll comes with a mane of deep red hair and a glittery tail that acts like a snow globe. In the last quarter it helped Disney’s consumer products ision to an operating income of £264m on revenue of £880m.But the investigation found that, when costs were broken down, each of the women on the production line was receiving just 1p for every doll produced.*The investigator joined the Sing \u0026amp Sparkle assembly line for a month during the summer. From her own experience and interviews with fellow workers, she found daily overtime varied between two and five hours and that, with weekends included, overtime would sometimes hit 175 hours a month – nearly five times the legal limit of 36 hours.In low season, workers earned about 2,000 Chinese yuan a month (£228) during peak season, they generally took home about 3,000 yuan. A survey last year put the average Chinese monthly salary at 7,665 yuan.Workers were expected to arrive 10 minutes before the start of their shifts many reported feeling excessively tired because of the long hours. Photographs from the production lines show workers asleep or resting during breaks.In her diary, the investigator noted: “At 5pm, the worker behind me said she felt so tired that her back was sore. She wanted to sleep so badly but couldn’t, since our shift wasn’t over yet. She wondered why was time going by so slowly. I said that I also felt time was going by very slowly. When you’re constantly doing the same thing over and over again, you start to feel dizzy and your vision becomes blurry.”She also noted that most of her colleagues were women over the age of 45 who were drawn to the work because they were “poorly educated, well-behaved, obedient, and care more about children and family”. Factories like them because “they are less likely to make trouble and easier to manage” than men, she wrote.“There were a lot of female workers at the toy factory and some of them were older. So, when they worked, they needed to wear reading glasses. They worked very carefully and quickly, but some of the time, the line leader would say they worked too slowly or would yell at them. Whenever the female workers were being yelled at, they would never say a word in return and would silently continue working on the task at hand.”Simone Wasmann, from Solidar Suisse, urged toy companies to share some of their profits with workers.“Children love Disney’s toys but we want their parents to understand that there’s no Christmas magic going on here: those toys were made with cheap labour by women working illegally long hours for pennies.“For them, it is just day after day of misery. They don’t work in those factories long into the night because they want to: they do that because it is the only way they can make enough money to live.”Many of the biggest toy makers – including Disney and Mattel – are members of the International Council of Toy Industries Ethical Toy Program, which sets out expected industry standards intended, the body says, to improve working conditions in toy factories.The Wah Tung factory is certified by the ETP. Speaking on the factory’s behalf, ETP spokesman Mark Robertson said: “The allegations highlighted from the CLW report contravene ethical toy programme’s own requirements on working hours, wages, holiday pay and annual leave. We will work directly with factories to address any issues identified.“We take the issues raised by China Labor Watch very seriously and have launched our own investigation. We will quickly and effectively address any issues identified which are in breach of our standards.”Robertson said that the ETP had achieved substantive progress in raising ethical conditions at the organisation’s certified factories in China and elsewhere. “Wages have increased, factory environments are safer and working hours are reducing hours worked at toy factories in China are lower than those in the apparel and electronic sectors.”A spokesman for Disney said the brand was a member of the ethical toy programme’s committed brands plus programme, which it used alongside others “as part of our responsible sourcing approach”.He referred to a statement from ETP in which the council said it welcomed “any robust investigation which increases our understanding of working conditions at toy factories”.Mattel said it had no current production in the factories mentioned in the CLW report.“Mattel is committed to ensuring every single person making our toys and products is treated fairly, with respect, and is able to work in a safe and healthy environment. Our labour standards, environmental, health and safety programmes and oversight processes reflect this commitment, and we stand behind our record of ethical labour practices and environmental stewardship.”Three other factories producing for a large number of international brands feature in the full report.* This figure represents the total monthly wages of the 36 women on the production line, working an average of 26 days a month, ided by the total number of dolls produced each month"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e1654330834ab8d2b8db90e1a3a3eeb031da452/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca47a373752a60c1f1f1126dac5e8063","title":"bruce springsteen springsteen on broadway review magical myth busting with the boss","story":"Springsteen uses an unlikely venue to puncture his own stage persona, in an enthralling recording of wit and wisdom The announcement of his residency at New York’s Walter Kerr theatre caused an immediate stampede for tickets, but the notion of Bruce Springsteen on Broadway seemed a strange one. He rose to fame as a purveyor of honest, bar-band rock, devoid of the ponderous flim-flam, elevated self-importance and glittery excess to which other 70s musicians were partial a trustworthy teller of gritty truths about blue-collar America a true believer in the primal power of rock’n’roll. He’s a very odd fit among the razzle-dazzle of the Great White Way’s other current musical offerings: Phantom of the Opera, Chicago, The Cher Show and Frozen.Or perhaps not. Virtually the first thing you hear on this 150-minute live recording is Springsteen slyly informing his audience that he’s exactly what fans think he’s not: phoney. “I come from a boardwalk town where everything is tinged with just a bit of fraud – so am I … I’ve never held an honest job in my entire life … never worked nine-to-five … I’ve never seen the inside of a factory and yet it’s all I’ve ever written about. Standing before you is a man who has become wildly and absurdly successful writing about something of which he had absolutely no experience. I made it all up.”Should anyone think that Springsteen on Broadway is a stark, purgative exercise in stripping away decades of accumulated mythology, it’s worth noting that Springsteen follows this confession with a description of seeing Elvis on the Ed Sullivan Show. It’s so epic in its mythologising that it brings to mind Nick Cave’s Tupelo, a song that depicts Presley’s birth as an awesome, terrifying supernatural event from the pages of the Old Testament. This contrast sets the tone for the whole enterprise. Springsteen on Broadway is a really charming album – charming enough, in fact, to convince a Boss agnostic that there’s more to the man than they might previously have thought – and its charm rests on Springsteen’s alternating conflicting desires to let light in on what he calls “the magic trick”, and suggest that it might really be magic after all.We learn that Bruce Springsteen is as much a contrived character as Ziggy Stardust – a stadium-filling exaggeration of Springsteen’s troubled factory-worker father – and that we should be wary of treating what he says as gospel: “I’m Mr Born to Run … New Jersey is a death-trap, listen to my lyrics … I currently live 10 minutes from my hometown.” But we also learn that the man behind said character truly believes all the hokey stuff he yells at those packed stadiums about just being a prisoner of rock’n’roll, a belief occasionally expressed in terms so earnest they would make Bono blush: “Bands come in search of lightning and thunder … a communion of souls … true rock’n’roll will never die.” Nor, unlike a lot of performers who have created a character to inhabit on stage, is Springsteen a man much crippled by self-doubt: “Before me, there was no Jersey Shore. Jersey almighty, I fuckin’ invented it.”Its charm is aided by the fact that, while clearly scripted, the between-song monologues – which occasionally last three or four times as long as the song they’re introducing – are filled with striking, writerly imagery: his lengthy description of being sent into his local bar as child to fetch his dad home is a funny, telling short story in itself. If the monologues occasionally overshadow the material they’re meant to support, more often the stripped-back acoustic performances alone cast his songs in fresh light. Denuded of the E Street Band’s post-Phil Spector blare, Thunder Road sounds dark and desperate rather than cathartic. Born in the USA undergoes the most dramatic transformation: it starts out as – of all things – a Within You Without You-esque faux-raga, then turns into desolate a capella blues. Its triumphal original incarnation became perhaps the most widely misunderstood song in rock history. Here, there’s absolutely no doubt what Springsteen was driving at all along. Perhaps understandably, given its history, Born in the USA is preceded by a very lengthy explanation of its genesis. This is one of a handful of moments where, in recorded form at least, you start to wish he’d get on with it. It’s not the only point where Springsteen on Broadway hits the standard problem with live albums as a poor substitute for actually being there.The appearance of his wife and musical collaborator Patti Scialfa was widely reported as an emotional highlight of the Broadway shows. Here, it doesn’t seem that way: her voice sounds beautiful harmonising on Tougher Than the Rest, but some atmospheric impact has clearly been lost in the transition from stage to tape. Most of the time, however, the cocktail of homespun wisdom, frankness and blatant yarn-spinning is genuinely enthralling, a portrait of the rock star as a complex, conflicted 69-year-old man.Confidence Man – Santa’s Comin’ Down the ChimneyA useful corrective to the already nerve-jangling sound of Wonderful Christmastime and Do They Know It’s Christmas blaring out everywhere: a minimal, funky 80s house-inspired bit of festive cool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bca78cea8ca062e2814c2649a51ff2998095973/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=817a81b5ee5c555c32cd8d9b7298d6d9","title":"bias in britain the truth about modern racism","story":"An exclusive  study has shown the extent of racial bias faced by minority ethnic citizens. ’s Afua Hirsch and Anushka Asthana discuss how growing up in a majority white society felt to them and whether attitudes have significantly changed since.

First, the woman to whom Watling has begun his pitch inside a local hair salon is adamant she no longer listens to talk about Brexit. Then there is the small issue that the MP himself has not yet decided if he backs the prime minister’s plan.“I’m totally sick of it,” says Carol Kincaid, politely but firmly, her part-coloured hair in foils as she waits in a chair, the newly arrived Watling perched next to her. “When I hear the B-word, if it comes up on the radio, I go for the button so I can listen to music.”Tough audiences are nothing new to Watling, who was an actor and stage director before entering parliament in 2017, and is still probably the only politician to have pulled out of a touring production of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert to fight a byelection.He persists gently with Kincaid, but she is adamant: “I haven’t listened to the deal. I’m guilty of switching off. I don’t feel that people have any power with politicians. The banks and civil service run the country. Money runs the country.”Watling’s Essex constituency, which takes in prosperous districts as well as areas such as Jaywick, officially England’s most deprived neighbourhood, may not be typical of the fight to sell May’s Brexit plan to the masses, being disproportionately older and more pro-leave.But as Watling treks around the businesses and postwar bungalows of Burrsville, a mile or so north of the seafront, themes emerge that seem common nationally: people are bored of Brexit and want the process completed they admire May’s tenacity, but worry about her proposals.Watling, still known to some locals for playing an amiable vicar in the 1980s sitcom Bread, concurs: “There’s an enormous amount of people who just want it done, want some certainty, to get it over with. There is also a fear that we might inadvertently hand the keys of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn, just by not sorting it out.Watling’s mini-tour begins in the Robert Burre pub, a rare historic building in an area that was mainly countryside before the second world war. There, a representative from Heineken, the host brewery, quietly presses the MP on the need for business certainty.At the next table, the pub managers, Kelvin and Susan Davies, explain that talk of Brexit is rare among customers, the great majority of whom are – like the couple themselves – of retirement age. “They’re the only people around here with any money to spend,” says Kelvin, 72.He continues: “The vast majority of people, like myself, just wish it was over and done with, and we just get out. Ninety percent of our customers want to be out.“At the end of the day the consensus is: they’re scaremongering, they say we can never manage on our own. But we’re Great Britain, we managed for centuries on our own. We led the world. Why should we be afraid of going it alone now?”For all the gung-ho talk, Davies says he is reconciled to May’s plan, one that alarms most Brexiters in parliament: “I think Theresa May is doing a good job under the circumstances. There’s a lot of people against her at the moment, but she’s steering a good path. It seems the best deal we can get.”If this might sound reassuring for the prime minister, there is worse news when Watling starts knocking on doors in the surrounding houses, many occupied by people who left London and its suburbs for a quieter retirement – and cheaper property – by the coast.A woman who answers the door in a leopardskin onesie says she is still a supporter of Ukip, the party that represented Clacton after Douglas Carswell defected from the Conservatives in 2014, defeating Watling in the byelection, and then again in the 2015 election, before standing down.The woman, who gives her name only as Deborah, is scathing about the prospects for May’s departure plan: “The French will go on about fishing rights, the Spanish about Gibraltar, and all the nations in Europe have got to agree before they sign this off.”Watling tries to reassure her, but Deborah argues a no-deal Brexit is the only option: “I just want out. I voted to come out, simple as that. I don’t want to be tied to Europe at all. I’m not European. I’m English and I want our sovereignty back.”For all the vehemence, when asked about how May has performed, even Deborah concedes her respect – certainly when compared with the previous prime minister.“She seems strong. I don’t like the deal but I think she’s done pretty well. That Cameron – like what’s-his-name out of EastEnders said, he’s got on his trotters and run, and left us. Simple as that.”Watling says respect for May is a sentiment he hears from those holding more or less every shade of Brexit opinion: “Theresa May on a personal level has massive support. I think any vote of no confidence would fall immediately. And that’s why it hasn’t happened. Nobody wants the job, either. Who would want a job like that? You might agree or disagree with her position, but you can’t fault her for stamina or resilience.”It has already been an eventful few weeks for Watling. Last month the MP was driving home from London on a Thursday evening when an emergency call from the BBC saw him erted to the filming of that week’s Question Time in Clacton, after the Treasury secretary, Liz Truss, was stuck on a train. He jokes it is not the first time he has been an emergency understudy.Watling, 65, now faces the most taxing decision of his slightly unexpected late second career in national politics, when MPs vote on Tuesday on May’s deal.He has submitted his own amendment to the motion, seeking to reduce the potential scope of the European court of justice if the Northern Irish backstop plan comes into force.He says: “I speak as a remainer, who wouldn’t have done this in the first place, but if we’re going to go through all this pain and uncertainty, and at the end of it we don’t have sovereignty and the European court of justice has dominion over the backstop, then what’s been the point?”In the coming days Watling will face yet more competing demands from sceptical constituents and Conservative whips.He says: “I do get it in the neck from everybody, from all sides. That goes with the territory. But there is an enormous amount of pressure building to just sign the thing, get it sorted. I have my issues with it, but I’m really sympathetic.”Amid all this, Watling confirms, he has yet to decide whether to back the prime minister: “A week really is a long time in politics, and I think it’s foolish to declare your position this long before the event.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fc8d6f440fdeaaaea5ca96e081baa9826eb5fb7/24_119_2676_1606/master/2676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24c59c28050fbd18595a52b05eb90994","title":"theresa may rejects cabinet pleas postpone brexit vote","story":"PM instead offers a concession in the form of ‘parliamentary lock’ on Irish backstopTheresa May has rejected a plea from some in her cabinet to postpone the vote on the withdrawal bill but has offered concessions to parliament on the contentious issue of the backstop arrangement for avoiding an Irish border.Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether she was prepared to delay a vote she is expected to lose, May said: “No. What I am doing is leading up to a vote on Tuesday. Yes I am meeting colleagues, I’m listening to colleagues’ concerns. Not about delaying it, I’m listening to colleagues’ concerns around the backstop.”May signalled that she was determined to plough on with a vote and suggested a “parliamentary lock” on the Irish backstop could persuade more MPs to back it.She said: “I am talking to colleagues about how we can look at parliament having a role in going into that and coming out of that.”This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.She insisted a backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland was inevitable in any deal, including “Norway” and “Canada” options being proposed by some as alternatives to her plan.She confirmed she was in discussions with MPs opposed to the deal about giving parliament a say in whether the UK entered backstop arrangements or extended the transition period.May said: “If we get to that point there will be a choice between going into the backstop and extending the transition period.”She added: “There are pros and cons to both sides of that. People have a concern at the backstop that we could be in it indefinitely. But in the backstop we have no financial obligations, we have no free movement, and we have very light level playing field rules with the EU. In the implementation period we still have to negotiate the terms, but there will be concerns that there would be more money to be paid, for example.“The obvious, in terms of the role of the UK, is for it to be parliament that makes these decisions.”Asked if she had a plan B if her deal was voted down on Tuesday, May said: “That question is not for me, that question is for those who want to oppose this deal. The options are there: there’s a deal, no deal, or no Brexit.”She added: “It is clear that there are those in the House of Commons who want to frustrate Brexit and overturn the vote of the British people, and that’s not right.“The risk is that we end up with no Brexit at all. I’m clear that should not happen. We have a good deal for leaving the European Union.”May repeated her opposition to a “people’s vote” on her deal. “I don’t think there should be another referendum. We gave people the choice in the referendum as to whether to leave the European Union or not and they gave us a very clear message.”She said those backing a second referendum wanted the public to give a different message. “There are many people who are talking about a second referendum – it isn’t anything to do with this deal, it is actually about trying to frustrate Brexit. This is a point in time when everybody should be thinking of the national interest. And the national interest is making sure that we deliver on that vote.”Calling for unity over the deal, she said: “Now is the time for this country to come back together again. Let’s not create more ision by going back for another referendum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d0e3f4ce5fea5a4c9d66edcf64f65a799689cfe/0_34_3048_1830/master/3048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ed1dcc133c436ba0c3477c22369adbb","title":"brexit debate theresa may deal latest may interviewed on today politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including day three of the Commons Brexit debateThe Times’ Sam Coates has got hold of the note distributed by the Tory whips ahead of today’s debate to encourage helpful interventions.Hammond says there is no Brexit deal available that would allow the financial services industry to keep passporting (the arrangement that allows firms to trade freely in the EU).Although the UK will not have an influence in future on the shaping of EU financial regulations, it will influence global decisions about regulations - which will in turn have an influence on the EU, he says.Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, intervenes. Does he accept that remaining in the EEA would preserve the economic benefits of EU membership, if not the political benefits?Hammond accepts that point. But he says there are two main problems with this proposal. First, the UK would have to accept free movement. And, second, the financial services industry would have to comply with a lot of fast-changing EU regulations over which it would have no control.Hammond says Labour are “deluded” if they think they can get a Brexit deal delivering all the benefits of being in the EU, with no payments to the EU, no state aid rules, and no free movement.The only way of obtaining all the benefits of being in the EU is by staying in the EU, he says.Labour wants to stay in the customs union. But that would not deliver benefits like a frictionless border, he says.Hammond says he expects the economy to grow after Brexit, under all scenarios.And he says the government Brexit economic analysis (pdf) released last week did not contain forecasts. Instead it was a modelling exercise, showing how different types of Brexit compared.He says the Chequers plan scenario would produce more growth than all the other scenarios modelled.Hammond says that, if the UK has to make a choice between extending the transition (or implementation period, as he puts it, using the government’s preferred phrase) or going into the backstop, he would favour extending the transition.Hammond says he has observed this process closely for two years. The idea that renegotiating the deal at the 11th hour is possible is “a delusion”, he says.He says this is the best deal on the table. Only the compromise set out in the deal would allow the UK to move on.Divided nations are not successful nations, he says.As Hammond starts, Labour’s Clive Betts intervenes and asks Hammond about something he told the Treasury committee yesterday. Betts said Hammond used to say that leaving the EU would be bad for the economy. But now he is saying it would be better to leave than to hold a referendum and stay. Why did he change his mind?Hammond says he has always been clear that leaving the EU would have economic disadvantages, But he says he thinks the wider impact of ignoring the EU referendum result would be worse.Before the debate started Boris Johnson apologised to the Commons for breaching the rules by declaring some royalty payments late. (See 10.54am.)Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is about to open the third day of the Brexit debate.John Bercow, the speaker, starts by saying 75 MPs want to speak in the debate today.In a speech in Dublin today Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, is saying that Theresa May should withdraw article 50 if she loses the Brexit vote next week. According to extracts released in advance, he is saying:The worst possible outcome – which remains a grave concern given the political uncertainty in Westminster - is that the UK leaves the EU with no Brexit deal at all.This would not only be devastating for London’s economy, but would actually hurt businesses and economies across Europe – including here in Dublin – and increase the chance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.In my view, the prospect – the very notion – of a no deal Brexit must be taken off the table by the British government.It’s just too dangerous to leave as a possibility. That’s why – today – I’m calling on Theresa May to withdraw article 50 if the British Parliament rejects her deal next week, which is looking extremely likely. This move would be the single best way to guarantee that we avoid falling off the cliff edge. It would stop the clock that is ticking down towards a no deal Brexit, and it would provide the breathing space to decide how we resolve this mess. If the British prime minister refuses to take this precautionary step – we would continue heading towards a no-deal Brexit in just a few months’ time – and would risk us having to explain to future generations why the government of the day knowingly put our economy, our prosperity and our place on the world stage in such grave peril.It is worth stressing that Khan is calling for article 50 to be revoked in the event of May losing the vote. That is not the same as asking for article 50 to be extended. Extending it would delay Brexit beyond 29 March. Withdrawing it would cancel Brexit altogether.Under the Lisbon treaty, article 50 can be extended, with the unanimous agreement of all EU member states.On Monday the European court of justice will give a definitive ruling on whether the UK can revoke article 50 unilaterally. Earlier this week the court’s advocate general issued an opinion (pdf) saying a state could revoke article 50 unilaterally. Opinions like this are normally a reliable guide to what the court will decide, and if the ECJ follows the advice of its advocate general, then Khan’s proposal will in theory be do-able.But the article 50 case was mostly about a country that changes its mind about leaving the EU. Khan says the UK should withdraw article 50 to give itself more time to take a decision. During the ECJ hearing the lawyer for the European council expressed concern about the possibility of a country being allowed to withdraw article 50 as a negotiating tactic and, in his opinion (pdf), the advocate general said the right to revoke article 50 should be subject to “certain conditions and limits” in order to “prevent abuse of the procedure”. It is not clear whether or not revoking article 50 just to “stop the clock” would count as such an abuse.Another problem is that, under the EU Withdrawal Act, the UK will be leaving the EU’s legal regime on 29 March anyway. To stop Brexit, as well as revoking article 50, the PM would have to repeal all or part of that Act."},{"url":null,"title":"lsd guides psychedelic assisted psychotherapy","story":"Some Americans searching for alternative paths to healing have turned to psychedelics. But how does one forge a career as a guide when the substances are illegal? Steve has cops in his family, so he doesn’t tell many people about his work as an underground psychedelic guide. The work takes up a significant amount of his time – around once a week, he’ll meet a client in their home or in a rented home, dose them with MDMA or hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms, and sit with them while they trip for up to 10 hours – but he doesn’t tell his siblings, parents or roommates about it, nor his fellow psychology PhD students.They would probably never guess, either: Steve doesn’t display any signs of involvement with a stigmatized counterculture that many Americans still associate with its flamboyant 1960s figureheads. He’s a bespectacled, soft-spoken former business school student who plays in a brass band and works part-time as an over-the-phone mental health counselor. After one glass of wine, he says: “Whoa, I’m feeling a little drunk.”But if you probe, he might tell you about the time he took psilocybin and a “snake god” entered his body and left him convulsing on the floor for an hour. (The snake god was benevolent, he says, and the convulsing was cathartic, “a tremendous discharge of anxious energy”.)In early October, Steve attended a Manhattan conference called Horizons: Perspectives on Psychedelics, which bills itself as the world’s “largest and longest-running annual gathering of the psychedelic community”. I went with my 51-year-old cousin, Temple, a relatively mainstream psychotherapist. She had come to learn more about psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, which underground guides like Steve facilitate illegally. She hopes to incorporate this type of therapy into her practice if and when substances such as psilocybin, MDMA, LSD and ayahuasca become legal.Like many attendees, Temple had recently read How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence, a bestselling 2018 book by Michael Pollan. It convinced her that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy “might really be the way of the future”.Indigenous people are believed to have used plant-based psychedelics for millennia now, factions of the western medical establishment seem to be catching on. But most psychedelics are still Schedule I controlled substances, in the same category as heroin and cocaine possession or sale has been punishable by prison sentence since 1971. With rare exceptions, the only way you can legally consume psychedelics in the US is as a participant in one of a few clinical research trials conducted at universities such as New York University and Johns Hopkins.These studies have yielded astounding results: they suggest that, when administered to carefully screened patients by trained health professionals, psychedelics are safe and potent tools for alleviating PTSD, addictions, cluster headaches, anxiety and depression.Amid a broken healthcare system and rising rates of opioid addiction and suicide, Americans are searching for alternative paths to healing, which is where underground guides come in. The industry has its share of charlatans, but many guides hold themselves to ethical standards and protocols comparable to those established in clinical settings.Unlike psychotherapists, however, underground guides have no accredited educational institutions, no licensing and no way to publicly market their services. How, then, does one make a career as a guide?Steve was one of many guides I spoke to who described feeling spiritually “called” to do this work. Like doctors who provided abortions pre-Roe v Wade, he breaks laws that he believes are unjust he considers legal violations a risky but necessary part of his quest to alleviate people’s pain. He charges on a sliding scale that ranges from around $15 to $50 an hour.As is the case with most guides, his own psychedelic experiences convinced him the job was worth the risk.“During an early guided psilocybin session, I realized I’d never adequately dealt with the pain caused by my parents’ orce,” Steve says. “There was clearly still this 11-year-old part of myself that was like, ‘I want to be part of a coherent family unit.’ During the experience, I was given this vision – there’s no way to say this that doesn’t sounds silly – but there was this mother figure who was like, half-Vedic goddess, with a million arms and a million eyes, and half-space alien, with gray skin. She was this space mother, surrounded by this space family, and she just beamed to me this incredible welcoming feeling of, this is the ine family that you stem from.”In addition to keeping quiet about his work, Steve uses an encrypted messaging app to communicate with clients – precautions he takes to avoid the kind of legal trouble that has befallen some underground guides, such as Eric Osborne, a former middle school teacher from Kentucky.On a July afternoon in 2015, state troopers showed up at Eric’s gourmet mushroom farm in Indiana with search warrants.They searched his house, then trawled through his mushroom fruiting chambers, inspecting racks of shiitakes, turkey tails and reishis, which he sold to upscale local restaurants. Eric was confident the police would find nothing incriminating there – he grew his psilocybin mushrooms far from his restaurant-bound crops – but when he saw them heading towards the woods on his property, he panicked.Two nights earlier, Eric and his then fiancee had sat around a campfire with a new friend, all tripping. A self-described “recovering Catholic” with a southern drawl who, in 2009, became Indiana’s first state-certified wild mushroom expert, he had been offering underground psilocybin therapy sessions for years. (He has no formal training in psychology he says the mushrooms, which he’s consumed at high doses around 500 times, are his teachers.)The friend had hoped a session might help resolve a years-old trauma. After the mushrooms took effect, she went to lie down in her tent. Minutes later, Eric saw a glow of headlights through the trees. As a safety precaution, he had hidden the woman’s car keys in the house, but now, her car was speeding down his driveway.“My heart just dropped,” Eric says. “I was sure she was going to die.”Eric and his fiancee spent 14 hours searching for her before she texted, saying she was safe. She had crashed into a ditch near the farm after retrieving a spare key hidden under her car’s transom. No one was hurt, but after police found her, disheveled, she told them everything about Eric’s psilocybin operation to avoid being charged with drug possession.“I knew the cops were coming for me,” Eric says. Before they arrived, he stashed a pound of dried ‘Mr E’ psilocybin mushrooms – a unique strain he had bred and named himself and didn’t want to lose – inside a hollow log in the woods.Somehow, the police managed to find it: “That was the end, there.”He spent a week in jail contemplating the effects of the drug war on the mental healthcare system. “The horrible irony was, I sat in this cell with people who had drug addictions that psilocybin can help remedy,” he says. After being released, he was put on house arrest with an ankle monitor for eight weeks, forbidden from speaking to his fiancee, whose parents had bailed her out of jail after a day. He was facing a minimum of 10 years in prison for each of three B-felony charges – Schedule I substance manufacturing, distribution and possession.“The night our friend drove off was the most terrifying, gut-wrenching moment of my life, but in the eight weeks that followed, when I sat on those 87 acres alone, there were moments of complete despair. I had to take my shotguns to a neighbor,” he says. “I have uncles who were cannabis growers who spent years in prison. I was certain I’d follow in their path.”The judge at his trial was mercifully liberal, however. The B-felonies were pleaded down. Eric was convicted of “maintaining a common nuisance” and sentenced to two and a half years probation.“Yeah, that’s what I do – ‘maintaining a common nuisance’,” he says. “I’ve turned it into a career now.”He’s not joking: in October 2015, instead of quitting the mushroom world, he founded MycoMeditations, an above-board psilocybin-assisted therapy retreat center in Jamaica, one of the few countries where psilocybin is legal.“I felt I had no other option,” he says. “The landlord kicked me off the farm, I was working in a Louisville restaurant – I couldn’t go back to teaching with a felony – so I just pushed full speed into this. I felt like the medicine was so needed that I couldn’t not do it.”In the three years since, about 400 people from around the world have attended MycoMeditations’ seven- to 10-day group retreats in Treasure Beach, on Jamaica’s remote southern coast. Guests trip on psilocybin every other day in a fenced-in field surrounded by mango and coconut trees. “All I do is just sit there with people, supporting them silently, sometimes holding their hands,” Eric says.While every guide has a unique approach, above-board and underground psychedelic-assisted therapy tends to follow a similar structure. Before a trip, clients have preparatory therapy sessions with guides, discussing their mental health issues and intentions for treatment. (Some guides won’t work with people who take psychiatric medications they caution that prescription antidepressants can have potentially dangerous interactions with certain psychedelics, especially ayahuasca.)During the trip, guides sit with the client, ensuring their safety, and, if necessary, helping them navigate what researchers call “difficult struggle experiences”.“What we find in talking with patients is that this ‘difficult struggle’ is not a bug in the experience, but actually a feature,” says Dr Alex Belser, who co-founded the psychedelic research team at NYU in 2006. “When they take these medicines, people go into difficult places – they deal with past grief, trauma and suffering, and feel those feelings intensely, for a time … Without a strong sense of safety and trust with a therapist, that may lead to what’s been called a ‘bad trip’. But if there’s enough intention put into supporting that experience, it’s the beginning of an arc of healing that can lead to something extraordinary.”After a trip, guides facilitate “integration” sessions, in which the client strives to incorporate lessons from the experience into their everyday lives. At MycoMeditations, after integration sessions, guests get massages and swim among sea turtles and coral reefs.One attendee, a stage four cancer patient, felt so healed by the retreat that she donated a year’s salary to Eric, which allowed him to quit his job at the Louisville restaurant – he had been splitting his time between Jamaica and Kentucky – to focus full-time on the center. “Now she’s in remission, traveling the country fly-fishing in her Mercedes Winnebago,” Eric says. “Miracles are becoming – not mundane, but pretty normal around here.”I meet Hummingbird at Alice’s Tea Cup, an Alice in Wonderland-themed cafe in Manhattan. Wearing a lavender shawl and a gold turtle-shaped brooch, Hummingbird matches the decor. One of six children of Cuban immigrant parents, she calls herself a “medicine woman” her approach to guiding is ceremonial rather than clinical.As a teenager in New Jersey in the 1980s, she was a star cheerleader and an enthusiastic participant in the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (Dare) program. Since age 10, she’d dreamed of becoming a social worker after getting her master’s, she “tried basically every social work job” she could find, including working at a methadone clinic and as a family therapist in the Bronx. “I was very googly-eyed,” she says. “Quite the idealist. I wanted to change the system.”After several years, though, “apathy was building”, she says. “I was very dissatisfied with the system, getting burnt out, very ill – constant bronchial infections, flus.”During one such illness, while she was managing a program aimed at reducing psychiatric hospital reciism, she tried treating herself with herbs – elderberry root and slippery elm – instead of visiting a doctor. This induced a fever dream of sorts, she says: “I’m having cold sweats and chills, and I feel this weight on me – this being, making this purring noise, in a language I now understand a lot better. It was calling me. I wake up and say: ‘OK, I’m leaving my job.’”Shortly after she quit, a friend took her to a ceremony in Upstate New York and introduced her to “abuela”, as many devotees call ayahuasca, a plant-based tea containing the natural hallucinogen DMT. “By then, I’d tried everything – mushrooms, LSD, ecstasy, cocaine – but this was different,” Hummingbird says. “The sky opened up. At the end of a walkway of stars was this feeling, like, you’re home. I was flooded with tears of gratitude. And I started talking in this other language, chirping away, talking to birds in the woods.”On sabbatical, she backpacked through Guatemala, where she attended eight more ayahuasca ceremonies led by indigenous curanderas. “When I came back to my luxurious home, I was shocked at the US way of life,” she says. “I couldn’t believe I’d let myself become part of this system.”Instead of returning to social work, she studied indigenous healing traditions with a New York-based shaman, Irma StarSpirit Turtle Woman. In 2015, after adopting a “medicine name” – Hummingbird, translated from Zunzún, her Cuban grandmother’s nickname – she began leading ayahuasca ceremonies herself.Also on offer is sananga, a psychoactive eye drop that burns like habanero chilis, and Kambo, a drug made from the venom of the Amazonian giant monkey frog.Hummingbird’s work with the psychiatric healthcare system left her concerned that the millennia-old spiritual traditions surrounding psychedelics risk being sidelined in the process of medicalization. Despite psychedelic researchers’ attempts to quantify results with tools like the “Mystical Experience Questionnaire”, trip experiences – such as encounters with “snake-gods” – tend to fall outside the realm of contemporary scientific understanding.“Abuela is an ever-evolving quantity,” Hummingbird says. “There are no final end results, which science loves to have.”Since his book’s publication, Pollan’s readers have bombarded him with requests for referrals to underground guides – requests he turns down to protect his sources.Steve’s schedule is at capacity he finds himself turning away roughly three-quarters of referrals he gets, some of which come from licensed psychotherapists, who may risk losing their licenses by pursuing interests in illegal substances.The push for legalization has received bipartisan support: Rebekah Mercer, the billionaire Republican and co-owner of Breitbart, recently donated $1m to the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (Maps), a not-for-profit organization conducting much of today’s psychedelic research.In anticipation of expanded access, the California Institute for Integral Studies, in San Francisco, offers a training and certification program for medical and mental health professionals who hope to eventually facilitate legal psychedelic-assisted therapy.While underground guides tend to fiercely support decriminalization, a few, such as Jackie, say that even if psychedelics were to be legalized medically, they would continue to work underground.“I don’t want to work under the medical model,” Jackie says. “It’s too regimented for me.”Before she became a guide, Jackie worked as a birth doula and a registered labor and delivery nurse. “I used to sit with people as they gave birth to humans,” she says. “Now I sit with people as they give birth to themselves.”After leaving her “tumultuous, fucked-up family” at 17, she tried LSD for the first time with the man she would later marry. While raising her kids in the 1980s, she suffered from “persistent emotional pain” and tried everything to treat it: decades of psychotherapy, yoga, meditation, neurofeedback, self-help workshops. Nothing worked.In 2016, on the recommendation of her 30-year-old daughter, she attended a shaman-led ayahuasca retreat in Costa Rica. “Even as I was throwing up on the jungle floor, I was like: ‘Thank you. This is why I came here,’” she says. “Afterward, I felt like all the trauma stuck inside my body had been released.”Upon returning home, she broke up with her psychotherapist. “I haven’t felt a need to go back,” she says. “I’m a super joyful person now.” She began attending Horizons and training as a guide with several mentors.Now, at 57, she works full-time as a guide for two to four clients a month, either in her New England home or an Airbnb, charging several thousand dollars for 48-hour sessions and “unlimited post-trip integration”.Many of her clients are “genius entrepreneurs” most, she says, have little experience with drugs. She gets word-of-mouth referrals from all over the world and also mentors newbie guides.“As underground therapists, we have to think, what if the worst thing happened and we went to jail?” she says. “But if I went to jail, I think I’d still find a way to serve. And I know it sounds woo-woo, but I somehow feel protected by the mushrooms.”• Steve and Jackie’s names have been changed to protect their anonymity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/857f1d343497237148e077090d0d16ac82b093ad/203_402_2326_1395/master/2326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34d0a134381179c0af3a03c55ab5c9d9","title":"ada hederberg a dogs goal line clearance and vomit in madras","story":"This week’s roundup also features a British boxing love-in, a jazzy hockey song for the World Cup and Kevin Keegan singing1) Let’s have a look at the first ever women’s Ballon d’Or winner Ada Hegerberg being really good at football, rather than concentrate on some whopper asking her to twerk.

Then there’s Michael Clarke: bowler – firstly the 6-9 at Mumbai in 2004 (ultimately in a losing cause) and then the three wickets in an over that won Australia the SCG Test in 2008. Michael Clarke: batter – 329 in 2012. Back to 1986 now and one of the great feats of endurance, as Dean Jones scores 210 in Madras, featuring urine, vomit and who knows what else.

This is a proposed run of Thursday night fixtures to take place from late July to early September in which teams of racehorses accumulate points by finishing position.The idea is by no means past the post yet, because these fixtures have not yet been approved by the British Horseracing Authority. “We are in dialogue with the organisers,” a BHA spokesman tells me. “We will consider any application for extra fixtures on their merits, once received.”However, CHR (that’s Championship Horse Racing to you) must be odds-on to get approval if they can actually deliver on their promises because they are seeking to stage 48 races, all of which will offer more than £100,000 in prize money. No details are offered yet as to which trainers or owners will supply the horses to run in this series, or where the money will come from.You may recall that one of the organisers predicted in February that the scheme could become “a brand playground”, a concept to set your teeth on edge if ever there was one. If a brand has signed up yet, we are not told. For now, we know the proposed venues: Ayr, Epsom, Goodwood, Haydock, Leopardstown, Newbury, Newmarket and Sandown.In common with the City Racing proposal that had a successful trial last week, Championship Horse Racing also has the backing of the Jockey Club and would also like to be known as racing’s answer to cricket’s Twenty20, a means of simplifying and popularising the sport. It’s nice to think that our great game will be so much more popular this time next year ...On Thursday at Wincanton, I’m interested in Reikers Island (1.30), a point to point winner who pleased with his attitude on his chasing debut at Exeter last month but rather overdid the early enthusiasm and got tired on his first run since April. With that run behind him and at this sharper track, I think he’ll last home rather more strongly and odds of 13-2 appeal.Seven-year-old maidens are generally to be avoided but Lizzie Langton (2.35) has a chance to get off the mark after a promising third at Lingfield on her reappearance, her first run since wind surgery. If the step up in trip is a help to her, she can get in the argument at 11-2.Over at Market Rasen, punters are going mad for a Dan Skelton recruit, Rocku, who was last seen getting stuffed at Sedgefield 600 days ago. As a result, we’re offered 3-1 about Point N Shoot (3.00), who was in the form of his life when last seen in the spring.

You might think that today, with the emergence of neo-nazism in Europe and revelations about predatory producers in the US, it was beyond the pale. But judging by the riotous reception given to Raz Shaw’s superb revival, we embrace Brooks’s bonfire of good taste more warmly than ever.One reason, I suspect, is that audiences are now familiar with the big idea: that Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, a shyster producer and a nervy accountant, unite to persuade backers to over-invest in a musical about Hitler that is sure to fail. Not only do most people know the plot: they even seem to remember the jokes. When Leo quits his dead-end job and tells his boss: “I’m not going to the toilet, I’m going into showbusiness,” the line is greeted as if it were a well-loved friend.Far from giving offence, the show has now acquired an extra patina of charm. I’d also say that it’s a sign of liberal progress that we can afford to laugh at the stereotypes of yesteryear. When, for instance, Max and Leo go to visit an epicene director and his assistant mincingly invites them to “walk this way”, we are grownup enough to see that no harm is meant. Similarly, although we are more conscious than ever of the hazards of age, the spectacle of the randy oldsters who bankroll Max’s show tap-dancing with the aid of their walking-frames cheers rather than repels us.Even the number towards which the whole show builds, Springtime for Hitler, is outrageous rather than off-putting. One reason is that Brooks understood, like Chaplin before him, that there was always an element of kitsch vulgarity to nazism. So here, thanks to Ben Stones’s design and Alistair David’s choreography, we see begled chorines sporting sausage-shaped and eagle-crested headgear and goose-stepping with rhythmic enthusiasm. Not only is Brooks ridiculing the Hitlerian love of spectacle by having the critics hail Springtime for Hitler as a “satirical masterpiece”, he also pokes fun at our own ability to absorb shock.For all its daring, Brooks’s show is ultimately a nostalgic throwback to vaudeville and a testament to male friendship. Julius D’Silva’s wonderfully exuberant Max is both a conman and a father figure and I love the fact that, in a tribute to Zero Mostel, who created the role in the original movie, stray wisps of black hair snake across his pate. There is also a warmth to D’Silva that takes the sting out of the fact that Max uses sex as a source of capital.Stuart Neal lends the Joycean Leo the right air of wide-eyed earnestness, and there is fine support from Dale Meeks as an unreconstructed Nazi author and Charles Brunton as the show’s cross-dressing director.Even though Emily-Mae plays her well, the one joke that now looks past its sell-by date is that of the producers’ Swedish secretary who likes to have sex every day at 11. But this is a headily pleasurable show that, astonishingly, marks Shaw’s debut as a director of musicals and that offers as much fun as you could hope to find on any stage this Christmas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97486755bf0f54357fff096867e6522e696c40dc/163_152_4606_2764/master/4606.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40ae9dd71ebb7fb2a19423b15c0fbe1d","title":"bt removing huawei equipment from parts of 4g network","story":"Head of MI6 had questioned Chinese firm’s involvement in UK telecoms infrastructure BT has confirmed it is removing Huawei equipment from key areas of its 4G network after concerns were raised about the Chinese firm’s presence in critical telecoms infrastructure.The company said the removals were merely the continuation of a policy which began when it purchased the mobile phone carrier EE in 2015, to ensure that both parts of the combined network ran on the same technology. Many peripheral parts of BT and EE’s systems still run on Huawei equipment, and there were no plans to alter that.Governments in the US, New Zealand and Australia have already moved to block the use of Huawei’s equipment as part of the future rollout of 5G networks. Earlier this week the head of MI6 also suggested the UK needed to decide if it was “comfortable” with Chinese ownership of the technology being used.On Wednesday it emerged that Canada has arrested Huawei’s global chief financial officer in Vancouver, where she is facing extradition to the US in a move likely to exacerbate tensions between the US and China.Meng Wanzhou, one of the vice-chairs on the Chinese technology company’s board and the daughter of the company founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested on 1 December. A court hearing has been set for Friday, according to Canada’s department of justice.BT confirmed in a statement that it was in the process of removing Huawei equipment from the key parts of its 3G and 4G networks to meet an existing internal policy not to have the Chinese firm at the centre of its infrastructure.“In 2016, following the acquisition of EE, we began a process to remove Huawei equipment from the core of our 3G and 4G mobile networks, as part of network architecture principles in place since 2006,” BT said.Under BT’s “21st Century Network programme”, the company uses France’s Alcatel-Lucent (which was bought by Nokia in 2016) and US-based Cisco to provide core hardware. However, Huawei has still been involved in the network, providing the technology that powers the telephone exchanges, and also the optical fibre that connects the network core.“We’re applying these same principles to our current RFP (request for proposal) for 5G core infrastructure,” BT said. “As a result, Huawei have not been included in vendor selection for our 5G core. Huawei remains an important equipment provider outside the core network and a valued innovation partner.”Most notably, Huawei has been heavily involved in EE’s provision of the new emergency services network (ESN), a £1.2bn Home Office-led project to replace the ageing voice-only Airwave system that powers police, ambulance and fire brigade radios with a 4G-capable network that covers all of the UK’s major and minor roads. Earlier this year, BT’s Simon Frumkin, the head of the ESN project, described the company as a “key partner”.Other phone networks, such as Three, have also used Huawei equipment as part of their rollout of 5G-capable systems. Last month, Huawei’s Yang Chaobin said the company would “continue to work with Three UK to bring customers more market-leading commercial applications of 5G.”The news comes in the wake of the head of MI6, Alex Younger, questioning whether Chinese firms such as Huawei should be involved in UK communications infrastructure.He said that the UK would have to make “some decisions” about such firms after other governments had taken steps to block the firm. “We need to decide the extent to which we are going to be comfortable with Chinese ownership of these technologies and these platforms in an environment where some of our allies have taken a very definite position,” he said.Huawei was founded by a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army and questions have been repeatedly raised about the firm’s links to the Chinese state.A recent report to the US congress by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission suggested the Chinese government “exerts strong influence over its firms” and could “force Chinese suppliers or manufacturers to modify products to perform below expectations or fail, facilitate state or corporate espionage, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability” of devices and networks that use them.Huawei has always denied any improper links to the Chinese government.The company said: “Huawei has been working with BT for almost 15 years. Since the beginning of this partnership, BT has operated on a principle of different vendors for different network layers.“This agreement remains in place today. Since it acquired EE in 2016, the BT Group has been actively bringing EE’s legacy network architecture in line with this longstanding agreement.

More sharing, more friends and more connection will “make the world more open and connected” and “bring the world closer together”, Mark Zuckerberg has argued, even as his company has been engulfed by scandal.But confidential emails, released Wednesday by the British Parliament, reveal the hardheaded business calculations that lurked beneath the feel-good image projected by Zuckerberg and Facebook.“That may be good for the world, but it’s not good for us,” Zuckerberg wrote in a 2012 email about the possibility that developers would build applications that used data about Facebook users and their friends, but not provide any data back to Facebook.The emails provide an uncommon window into the thinking of Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives as they sought revenue streams amid an industry-shaking shift from desktop to mobile computing. Executives considered charging developers fees to gain access to user data – something Facebook now claims it would never do – and discussed other schemes to leverage the company’s scale and vast troves of user data into revenue. At one point, Zuckerberg mused about how Facebook could mimic financial institutions as an “informational bank” whose assets were user’s personal information rather than money.Facebook has strongly objected to the release of the documents, which it provided to the attorneys of a former app developer, Six4Three, during the course of a lawsuit. The documents were obtained and published by the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee, despite a court order by a US judge, who had sealed them.The company decried the publication of the “cherrypicked” documents in a blogpost published Wednesday, stating: “The set of documents, by design, tells only one side of the story and omits important context … The documents were selectively leaked to publish some, but not all, of the internal discussions at Facebook at the time of our platform changes. But the facts are clear: we’ve never sold people’s data.”Six4Three’s grievance stems from changes Facebook made in 2014 and 2015 to restrict developer access to user data. Facebook had previously allowed third-party app developers broad access to user data, ranging from their birthdays and profile pictures to the names of their friends and the contents of their private messages.In a Facebook post published Wednesday in response to the documents’ release, Zuckerberg wrote that “preventing abusive apps” on the platform “was the main purpose of this major platform change”. “This was the change required to prevent the situation with Cambridge Analytica,” he wrote. “If we had only done it a year sooner we could have prevented that situation completely.”But the emails reveal that some internal discussions focused on exploiting developers’ hunger for the user data to benefit Facebook’s bottom line, and that Zuckerberg himself was dismissive of the idea that developers could or would misuse user data.“I’m generally skeptical that there is as much data leak strategic risk as you think,” he wrote in an email in October 2012. “I think we leak info to developers, but I just can’t think of any instances where that data has leaked from developer to developer and caused a real issue for us.”In another email, he appeared to be aware that some developers were misusing their access to data, but appeared focused on how this harmed the company, not the users whose data was being accessed: “Not charging still means people will overuse and abuse our APIs and waste money for us, so I still think we should implement some kind of program where you have to pay if you use too many of our resources,” he wrote. “This should be relatively simple, achieve the goal of controlling costs and make us some money if we want.”That discussion of abuse comes from a lengthy email Zuckerberg sent to top executives at 2.54am on 19 November 2012, laying out his thoughts on the “platform business model”.“It’s important to first fully explore what we’re trying to get out of the platform,” he wrote. “The answer I came to is that we’re trying to enable people to share everything they want, and to do it on Facebook. Sometimes the best way to enable people to share something is to have a developer build a special purpose app or network for that type of content and to make that app social by having Facebook plug into it. However, that may be good for the world but it’s not good for us unless people also share back to Facebook and that content increases the value of our network. So ultimately, I think the purpose of platform – even the read side – is to increase sharing back into Facebook.”Ultimately, Zuckerberg wrote, he hoped to find “the right balance between ubiquity, reciprocity and profit”.In another email, which was forwarded to a handful of executives on 7 October 2012, Zuckerberg explained his inspiration for another idea – requiring developers to pay Facebook a fee, “perhaps on the order of ~$0.10  user each year” to access data about users.“I’ve been reading a lot of books on finance and banking recently, and even though the idea of an information bank is not identical to financial bank, the comparison suggests some interesting things,” he wrote. “For example, banks charge you interest for as long as you have their money out. Rather than letting devs pay a one time fee to fetch data, we could effectively do this by mandating that devs must keep data fresh and update their data each month.”He continued: “Another idea is charging different developers different rates for things. The whole banking industry is based on charging people different rates.”While it would hardly be noteworthy for a normal CEO to justify efforts to turn a profit, Facebook and Zuckerberg have long claimed to be driven by a sense of mission rather than a thirst for profit. In his post Wednesday, Zuckerberg couched this profit motive as a struggle for survival, writing, “Running a development platform is expensive and we need to support it.”In an email sent 26 October 2012, however, former Facebook executive and Zuckerberg confidante Sam Lessin provided his then-boss with another way to reconcile the company’s values with its baser needs.“Our mission is to make the world more open and connected,” Lessin wrote. “And the only way we can do that is with the best people and the best infrastructure – which requires that we make a lot of moneybe very profitable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2074ee976d2c284b98deece919e18093a8a3cce/0_79_5594_3359/master/5594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d95f66c7fbef1c2a9ebc1d9e4fbcc9","title":"huawei qa what you need to know about the chinese phone maker","story":"World’s largest telecommunications equipment firm has been blacklisted by several countries and its CFO arrestedHuawei (pronounced “Wah-Way”) is a telecommunications and electronics company based in Shenzhen in the south of China.Though its phones are popular all over the world, Huawei has been blocked by several countries from being involved in supplying equipment for the rollout of 5G networks, with governments citing national security fears.Already the governments of the US, New Zealand and Australia have moved to block the use of Huawei’s equipment in the rollout of future 5G networks.US regulations were announced in April that banned government companies buying from any company deemed a security threat, which was thought to be a way of blocking purchases by Huawei and another Chinese manufacturer, ZTE. In July, the US lifted the ban on ZTE as part of a settlement in which the company paid the US Treasury a $1bn penalty.In August the Australian federal government decided to bar Huawei and ZTE from supplying equipment to Australia’s 5G network, citing national security. New Zealand’s security services also blocked Huawei from supplying mobile network kit to a domestic company on national security grounds in November.In the UK, telecoms provider BT has just confirmed it is removing Huawei equipment from key areas of its 4G network, amid concern from MI6 about Chinese firms’ presence in such infrastructure.Huawei is a private company. However there are fears it and other Chinese manufacturers can be compelled by the Chinese security services to help with intelligence gathering. The national intelligence law passed this year requires all organisations and citizens to assist the country’s spy agencies.Speaking after Australia announced Huawei and ZTE would not be allowed to participate in the 5G rollout, the country’s spy chief said Huawei had been banned because it was a “high-risk vendor”. Mike Burgess, who is director-general of the Australian Signals Directorate, said the 5G network would underpin the country’s water supply, electricity grid, health systems and even self-driving cars, and so breaches due to “high-risk equipment” needed to be guarded against.On 1 December Canada arrested Huawei’s global chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of the founder of the company, Ren Zhengfei, an ex-army officer. This year she was promoted to one of four executives who serve as vice chair on a rotating basis, a move many took as a sign Meng was being groomed to take over the company. She was detained in Vancouver while transferring between flights. A court hearing has been set for Friday. Canadian police have not provided more information about the arrest but Reuters reported that Meng was arrested on suspicion of violating US sanctions against Iran. She faces extradition to the US.US authorities have been investigating Huawei since at least 2016 for allegedly shipping US-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of US export and sanctions laws, sources told Reuters in April. Beijing has protested against the arrest of Meng and demanded her release.The Chinese embassy in Canada released a statement saying China, “firmly opposes and strongly protests over such kind of actions which seriously harmed the human rights of the victim.”“The Chinese side has lodged stern representations with the US and Canadian side, and urged them to immediately correct the wrongdoing and restore the personal freedom of Ms Meng Wanzhou,” it said in a statement on its website.The editor of China’s often stridently patriotic state-run tabloid, the Global Times posted on Weibo: “It is clear the US is pushing the battle line to our door… We can completely regard the US arrest of Meng Wanzhou as a declaration of war against China.”When Australia announced Huawei would not be allowed to be involved in the 5G network, China’s commerce ministry said: “The Australian government has made the wrong decision and it will have a negative impact to the business interests of China and Australia companies.”In June, Huawei’s Australian chairman John Lord said Huawei would refuse to hand over data on Australian users to China, saying such an order would be “completely illegal”, calling the block of Huawei from the 5G network “short-term and small-minded”, and that many concerns about Huawei were “uninformed or just plain wrong”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0558417bb563f66715cff99188d792f795bb4891/0_432_2150_1290/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faec75bf020e46f654e8141a539875c8","title":"can i use predictive text pc app windows 10","story":"Richard likes Swype’s predictive text on his tablet and wants a similar app for a Windows 10 PCIs there an intelligent keyboard app for Windows 10? I use Swype on my tablet, and apart from being faster than keyboard typing, I love the power of its intelligent predictive text. My PC doesn’t have a touch screen, but I feel I would still benefit from the predictive text, as I’m not a touch typer. I looked at Grammarly, and a couple of others, but they’re not really what I’m after. RichardPredictive text programs have been around for a long time, and many are still available. The first one I used was Brown Bag Software’s MindReader, which arrived on a 5.25in floppy disk in the early 1980s. I don’t know if Brown Bag came up with the idea, but its approach is typical.MindReader read what you were typing, guessed what the word might be, and popped up a numbered list of choices. You could then insert a whole word by selecting the one you wanted. If you didn’t want any of them, you just carried on typing.Many predictive text programs use the PC’s function keys to make the selection, though I can’t remember if MindReader did this as well.If you were a fast typist – even the two-fingered type – then programs such as MindReader were more annoying than helpful. However, predictive software was tremendously useful to people who needed assistance for other reasons. Penfriend says its predictive software “benefits users who have dyslexia, visual impairment or physical disabilities, including cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, stroke, limb deformities and any condition which impairs the ability to write with a keyboard”.Predictive text programs are also useful in schools, because children can select words that they know but aren’t sure how to spell. Programs such as Quillsoft’s WordQ 5 help by voicing words. It’s usually easier to know if a word sounds right than if it looks right.There are lots of commercial programs aimed at schools. These include Penfriend XP and XL, WordQ, ClaroRead and Crick Software’s Clicker. Much less powerful but free examples for general use include TypingAid, Volkmar Kobelt’s VK TypeHelp and the open-source Presage, which was formerly known as Soothsayer. PhraseExpress isn’t cheap, but you can get a freeware version called Text Expander. TypingAid, which is written using AutoHotkey, works at the system level, so it works with most applications.If you take this route, the best program for your purposes could be SumitSoft’s Typing Assistant. Its features include word prediction, auto-complete, auto-correct and, for abbreviations, auto-expand. It has a Skilled Typist Mode for translators, secretaries, authors, programmers and so on and an Unskilled Typist Mode for people who have problems spelling (including in 50+ foreign languages) or physical disabilities. It costs $129.95 but there’s a 30-day money back guarantee. FastKeys is a cheaper alternative – see below.There’s also Texthelp’s Read\u0026ampWrite, which costs £150 a year and has more than 10 million users, thanks to its corporate and education versions. You’re unlikely to buy Read\u0026ampWrite, but there’s a Google Chrome extension that you can try free for 30 days.When smartphones arrived, predictive text was still a great time-saver. And with the moves from PC keyboards to Blackberry-style phone keyboards to on-screen touch keyboards, we finally got programs such as IBM’s ShapeWriter, Swype, SwiftKey and Google’s Gboard.The bad news is that, as you probably know, Swype has been discontinued. (Nuance bought the company from Cliff Kushler.) The good news is that many people preferred SwiftKey, and that SwiftKey is now being added to Windows 10. (In this case, Microsoft bought the company, despite Microsoft Research coming up with its own Word Flow keyboard.)In Windows 10 (October 2018 Update), go to the Settings cogwheel, select Devices and then Typing. Click on “Suggestions and autocorrections” and turn SwiftKey on for the languages you type in. The initial version should be much enhanced in future updates.It’s not going to be much use to you if you don’t have a touchscreen to work on, but a large proportion of Windows 10 laptops now have touchscreens.This is the age of “big data”, and it’s changing software. In the old days, you needed clever programming to do things like speech recognition and predictive text. Now you can deliver effective results with simple algorithms if you have enough data for pattern matching. Google has frighteningly large amounts of data, and it is using it to good effect.A couple of years ago I stopped using smartphone keyboards almost completely, because the speech recognition on my Android phone made typing a waste of time. And if your PC has a microphone, you can use speech recognition in Google Docs with a Chrome-type browser.Of course, speech recognition has been part of Windows for two decades, and in Windows 10, you can turn it on and off by pressing WinKey-Ctrl-S. There are also good specialised programs such as Nuance’s Dragon Dictate. But programs that run only on a local PC have a hard time competing with ones that use servers with AI and access to petabytes of data.The latest version of Gmail includes predictive text by default. Basically, Gmail’s Smart Compose system tries to complete your sentences and you just hit the tab key to accept its suggestion. It’s intended for writing emails, but you can write whatever you like, then copy and paste your text into a real document.Smart Compose might help smartphone users, but it’s worse than useless if you’re a touch-typist with a proper keyboard. Just thinking about whether to accept Smart Compose’s suggestions is distracting, and it’s usually far quicker to ignore them and just keep typing.To disable the Smart Compose and Smart Reply features in Gmail, click the cogwheel icon and select Settings. Go down the General menus and click the radio buttons to set “Writing suggestions off” and “Smart Reply off”. You can tell all your friends how easy it is to do this.Many programs will offer to complete a word once you have started typing it LibreOffice is a good example. (See my earlier answer on the difference between LibreOffice and OpenOffice.)LibreOffice has an AutoCorrect feature that remembers every eight-letter (or longer) word you type. The next time you type the first three letters of that word, it will offer to complete it. Again, this is annoying and will slow down a fast typist, but some users will find it a boon. It could work if you delete words you don’t want auto-completed and just type three letters plus Enter for long words you use often.In LibreOffice Writer, go to Tools, select AutoCorrect and then AutoCorrect Options. The AutoCorrect dialogue box has a tab for Word Completion. There you can set the minimum word length and change the “Accept with” key from Enter to Tab or, perhaps, the space bar.The common trick in Microsoft Office is to set up AutoCorrect options for long words or phrases that you use often. For example, #tyf could be autocorrected to “Thank you for your letter” while #csi could automatically insert chrono-synclastic infundibulum, or whatever.You could use the same approach system-wide with a program such as AutoHotKey. Better still, you could add a script that someone has already written, such as Uberi’s Autocomplete 1.2. The code is on GitHub so you could even adapt it yourself.As an alternative, FastKeys is a reasonably priced ($19 for three PCs) commercial Windows automation program specifically designed to save you typing.Have you got a question?

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

Its analysis showed the average UK temperature during June, July and August was more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.Hundreds more early deaths than usual occurred at the height of the heatwave, while farmers struggled for water and hay and thousands of houses suffered subsidence.The research was launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, and the Met Office’s Prof Peter Stott, who led the work, said: “World leaders should be listening not just to scientists but also to the people who are being affected by extreme weather events right now. They are seeing it with their own eyes and suffering from it. Humanity just won’t be able to cope with the world we are heading for.”Stott said scientists were making links across the world between extreme weather events and climate change, from heatwaves in Japan to wildfires in California: “We’re seeing it happen again and again across the world. This whole sequence of events would not have happened without climate change.”Prof Mark Maslin, at University College London, said: “The analysis clearly shows climate change has already changed our weather patterns and is having adverse effects on people’s lives. It is beholden on all governments to take heed of these warnings and start cutting carbon emissions as quick as possible.”John Sauven, an executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “The link between climate change and extreme weather used to be a fingerprint, it now looks more like a smoking gun. The science is leaving world leaders nowhere to hide. They are the first generation of political leaders with a clear view of the precipice we’re heading towards and may be the last to be able to swerve away from it.”The heatwave showed the vulnerability of farming and food security to global warming, said Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers Union. “Our industry is on the forefront of climate change impacts. The summer heatwave was hugely challenging and should be a wake-up call for us all.” She said long-term drought policies were needed, such as making it easier to get planning permission for new reservoirs.The Met Office analysis used sophisticated computer models to estimate the probability of such a hot summer in the UK in a world with manmade global warming and in a world without it. If humanity’s fossil fuel burning had not more than doubled the CO2 in the atmosphere, there would have been a less than one in 200 chance of the 2018 heat. But in today’s warming world, the probability was one in eight.The 30-fold increased risk surprised Stott: “It is a large number, but we checked it very carefully.” The methodology used has been peer-reviewed and the new analysis would be, too, but the Met Office said it was important to make the information public as early as possible.Stott’s team also looked at the Central England temperature record which stretches back to 1659. They found just one summer, 1826, as hot as 2018 in the two centuries up until 1850, when CO2 emissions began to rise fast. In contrast, there have been two other summers just as hot as 2018 in the last two decades, in 2003 and 2006.An earlier analysis of the summer heat in Europe also found that climate change had increased its risk, though it looked at the hottest three-day periods, not the whole season. Scores of extreme weather events around the world, including droughts and severe rainfalls, have been linked to global warming, including the Storm Desmond downpour that caused extensive severe flooding in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/100ec210eaadd59a794714fe698e04b692b9d627/187_419_4482_2689/master/4482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7cde1ee857471538c67061808e8b012","title":"on the road venezuela 20 years after hugo chavez rise","story":" travels across the nation the late Hugo Chávez dreamed of transforming, to understand its collapseThe latrines at Simón Bolívar international airport in Caracas overflow with urine the taps are bone dry. In the departures hall, weeping passengers prepare for exile, unsure when they will return.At customs, a sticker on one x-ray machine warns: “Here you don’t speak badly about Chávez!”But even before stepping outside the terminal it is obvious his Bolivarian revolution, like the airport’s immobile escalators, has ground to a halt.On 6 December 1998, Hugo Chávez proclaimed a new dawn of social justice and people power. “Venezuela’s resurrection is under way and nothing and nobody can stop it,” the leftwing populist told a sea of euphoric supporters after his landslide election victory.Two decades on, those dreams are in tatters.To understand Venezuela’s collapse, the  travelled hundreds of miles across the nation Chávez dreamed of transforming, from the spot in downtown Caracas where he gave his first speech as president-elect to his birthplace in the country’s sun-scorched southwestern plains.On the way, we encountered lingering affection for a charismatic populist still celebrated as a champion of the poor, and a determination among Venezuelans from all walks of life to somehow weather the economic cyclone ravaging their country.But above all, there was deprivation, hunger, profound apprehension and seething anger – even among proud chavistas – at a government now incapable of fulfilling its citizens’ most basic needs, and in denial over a humanitarian crisis unprecedented in modern Latin American history.“People do not understand what is happening in Venezuela because it is too hard to believe,” says Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, a doctor in the city of Barquisimeto, describing the implosion of a health service that was once the envy of the region. “The most oil-rich country absolutely devastated and turned into a war-torn nation – without a war.“I’m not angry. I’m terribly sad. Because there was absolutely no need to get to this point. They just left the country to die … and it is heartbreaking.”Twenty years after Chávez declared Venezuela’s rebirth, its capital is on its knees. Billboards try to persuade citizens that “together everything is possible” but the mood is funereal and dazed.By night, swaths of the city resemble a disaster zone: deserted, carless streets are plunged into darkness by power outages and broken street lights. Famished citizens probe uncollected heaps of rubbish.“The feeling I have is one of a slow-motion catastrophe,” says Ana Teresa Torres, a Caracas-based author. “It’s as if you are watching a building collapse and there is nothing you can do to stop it.”Despite the meltdown, in a traditionally chavista shantytown called San Agustín, there is still devotion to the politician many call “mi comandante”.“He was the man who took the poor out of the catacombs,” says Gilda González, 50, the local coordinator of Misión Ribas, an educational programme Chávez set up in 2003.González, a self-declared revolucionaria who keeps Fidel Castro’s memoirs by her desk, pointed to an horizon of government-built apartment blocks. “Everything you see here today was the comandante’s doing, and our president, Nicolás Maduro, is fighting hard to continue that work,” she said of the man who inherited Chávez’s revolution after he died in 2013.Venezuela’s leaders blame the country’s plight on sanctions and an “economic war” waged by what the foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, recently called the “extremist, supremacist, racist” government of Donald Trump. “It’s not just an economic war​,​ it’s an all-round war – a political war, a media war and a trade war,” Arreaza claimed.González agrees, and warns Bolivarian militias will resist if the US president makes good on insinuations that Maduro could be toppled by foreign force. “We are ready for asymmetric war,” she says.But as Venezuela staggers deeper into ruin, once-ardent believers are losing their faith. Pedro García, a chavista social worker and musician in the same community, claims Chávez’s heirs have led the country into an abyss of political infighting and thievery. As if to confirm his point, the following day Chávez’s former treasurer was sentenced to 10 years in jail in the US for taking more than a billion dollars in bribes.García said he continued to treasure the ideals underpinning Chávez’s Bolivarian struggle – but under Maduro, Venezuela had become like a pressure cooker that had been left on for too long. “This mess will explode any minute.”“See this? This is our country,” says Lilibeth Sandoval, a lawyer and regional representative of the opposition group Vente Venezuela, as she tiptoes through the debris of a derelict textile mill Chávez toured 13 years ago. “Destroyed!”At a nearby petrol station, attendants complain they have not been paid in months by Pdvsa, the state-run oil company that oversees the world’s biggest crude reserves. “And this is still a good job,” says Eduardo Martínez. Tips from drivers mean it is just about possible to survive.But Martínez’s trousers are shredded, his shoes filled with holes, and he has a seeping, untreated abscess on his left wrist. “One day this will all come crashing down, just like the Twin Towers,” he says.A grinning Maduro stares down from a billboard at the turn-off to the rural town of Macapo, alongside the rallying cry: “Vamos Venezuela.”Thousands of locals have already gone.The United Nations estimates 3 million have fled the country since 2015 to escape chronic food and medicine shortages, crumbling healthcare and transport systems and an economy in freefall.No life has been untouched and Guevara, 53, is no exception.In February his wife, Glenda, set off overland for Peru with a group of 15 relatives. She works as a carer-cum-accountant in Lima and sends funds to help her husband who lives off a weekly pension of about 900 bolivares (about $1.8) – an almost impossible task because of rampant hyperinflation that Maduro’s supposedly visionary economic recovery plan has failed to tame.“That’s not even enough to buy a kilo of cheese,” says Guevara.With his wife gone, Guevara has busied himself decorating his home ahead of a lonely Christmas. “This year there will be an emptiness,” he says, tears welling in his eyes.Guevara says he believes political change is on the horizon and Venezuela’s diaspora will soon return to rebuild their homeland. But like all those the  interviewed, he is unable to say how or when.Venezuela’s opposition is fractured and, while localised protests continue, the mass demonstrations of last year have faded, with many participants chosing instead to leave the country.Top chavista officials deny their citizens are going hungry and have called the migration crisis fake news. A visit to the one-room hovel Ivan Henríquez shares with his wife and six children in the city of Barquisimeto gives the lie to those claims. “They are living in a parallel world,” the 35-year-old says of the daily churn of disinformation on state TV.As Venezuela’s crisis has deepened over the past year, Henríquez, like millions of his fellow citizens, has found it increasingly hard to feed his family, let alone himself. “I used to weigh something like 70kg – now I’m 50kg, or less,” he says, showing the contents of their pantry: a half-empty sack of maize and a plastic bag filled with a few sticks of cassava.Outside, in a rubbish-strewn garden, his children – aged from 11 months to 13 – study around a table fashioned from a broken door with breezeblocks as legs.“So many people are dying of hunger in this country … children are dying because of malnutrition,” he says, lowering his voice to avoid his own offspring overhearing that bleak assessment.Henríquez blames his family’s plight on an ideological clash from which his country’s leaders have refused to step back. “Venezuelans are stuck in the middle of a war that isn’t theirs.”The highway to Barinas, the south-western state where Chávez grew up, is dotted with reminders of Venezuela’s decay: families hauling armfuls of firewood or hiking down the hard shoulder because public buses are now as hard to find as food police barricades where forlorn-looking officers shake down passersby for a pittance abandoned factories, grain silos and car showrooms being reclaimed by the undergrowth graffiti demanding the removal of the man most blame for the calamity – “¡Fuera Maduro!” – and patches of scorched asphalt where tires have been burned by protesters.Fading Socialist party murals insist everything is in order: “Chávez vive y la patria sigue!” (“Chávez lives and the homeland goes on!”)But these days few are fooled by such claims. “Our lives are becoming impossible,” says Ezequiel Mota, a 73-year-old farmer, queuing outside a military controlled petrol station in the state capital. He expects to be there for at least 10 hours.Across town the  saw three petrol queues of more than 140 cars each. In the countryside, a driver in an even longer line of vehicles says he has been waiting two days: “Sometimes it’s four.”“Ninety per cent of citizens are against the government because they are leading us into the most absolute state of misery and poverty in the world,” Mota says. “That’s the truth.”Rosa Rivas has a poster from Chávez’s final election campaign in pride of place on the wall of her sitting room. “I have so much faith in the president,” she says. “I fear nothing when he’s close by.”Rivas, at 85 still chavista to the bone, recalls wanting to die when she heard of her protector’s passing. “I love him,” she whispers.But in the town where Chávez was born, such dedication appears to be fading.Palencia, 46, says shortages of food, medicine, gas, petrol and drinking water mean many residents are turning against Chávez’s “malignant legacy”.A minstrel as well as a militant, Palencia reaches for a Venezuelan four-string guitar to perform his musical rebuke to chavismo. “From here in Barinas, I want to ask my Venezuela for forgiveness,” he sings. “Because we know it was here that the disaster began, it was here that the comandante who destroyed my nation was born.”Palencia’s mother, Vidalina, grew up with “Huguito” and cheered his rise to power in 1998. “I felt proud that a boy I knew was going to be president of the republic and suddenly everything was going to change,” the 68-year-old says.But Vidalina’s feelings shifted for good after she was diagnosed with cancer and – like millions of ailing Venezuelans – was unable to find the drugs she needed. “My only desire is for this mistaken revolution to end.”In 2016 Vladimir Putin donated a granite statue of Chávez to Sabaneta and it was placed in one of its main squares to celebrate the legacy of “the illustrious son of the Venezuelan people”.Today it is chipped and charred having been set upon by anti-government protesters. They failed to tear it down, but have vowed to return.Nearby, Chávez’s childhood home is open to the public as a tribute to Venezuela’s “21st-century liberator” and his Bolivarian crusade. But it, too, has fallen on hard times. One room lacks a lightbulb in another, a display case holding a pair of maracas has fallen off the wall and is propped up on two plastic chairs.Outside on the veranda, beside a mango tree the comandante once scaled, there is a guestbook containing homages that sometimes hint at Venezuela’s decline. “Very good,” one pilgrim wrote in April. “But lacking in electricity.”The museum caretaker, charged with receiving tourists since its two unpaid guides quit earlier this year, invites his latest visitors to add their names to the revolutionary register.There was just one problem. “We don’t have a pencil right now.”Additional reporting Patricia Torres and Clavel Rangel"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Video: UK Parliament TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s attorney general Geoffrey Cox reacting as the outcome of a vote on a motion to find Government ministers in contempt of parliament is passed. Photograph: Getty ImagesFrom the Irish viewpoint, the conclusions of the legal advice to the UK government on the Border aspect of the Brexit withdrawal deal are merely a statement of the obvious.But in Westminster they are nonetheless greeted as incendiary.The full text of the advice from the attorney general (AG), released on Wednesday, warns the UK government that the backstop arrangement for the Irish Border – involving the UK entering a customs union with the EU – could last “indefinitely”.The so-called UK-wide customs union, together with some regulatory checks on goods moving from Britain to the North, are the measures set down in the agreement to apply if no other way is found to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.This is the backstop – the insurance policy in relation to the border. The AG’s advice has highlighted the fact that this agreement, once triggered, could remain in place for a long time and tie the UK up in lengthy and potentially unsuccessful negotiations as it tried to escape.Accepting this risk has to be weighed against the desire to reach a stable agreement on their future relationship, the legal advice said. Striking this balance was “a political decision for the government,” attorney general Geoffrey Cox wrote.Interestingly, reports in London and comments by prime minister Theresa May suggest that she may be considering offering the UK parliament some kind of “lock” under which it would have to vote before the backstop came into place. But it is hard to see the EU side agreeing to this as anything which makes the backstop in any way contingent on a final UK go-ahead would threaten to completely undermine it. We will have to see how the plays out.The wider political point here is that both sides have said that it is not their intention that the backstop, if it was triggered, would be a permanent arrangement. Rather it would stay in place until another solution was found, presumably via a new trade deal between the EU and UK.However, the AG’s advice points out that there is no guarantee of another arrangement being concluded that avoids the need for border checks and so the backstop could remain in place for the long term.The backstop, in other words, could be for good and not just some temporary “fix”. As the AG put it: “Therefore, despite statements in the Protocol that it is not intended to be permanent, and the clear intention of the parties that it should be replaced by alternative, permanent arrangements, in international law, the Protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place in whole or in part, as set out therein.”This shows the success of Irish negotiators in getting a rock-solid commitment in the draft withdrawal agreement. However it is this very fact – and its implications for the UK’s future room for manoeuvre – which is now causing such debate in Westminster.The warning by the AG of endless rounds of talks and negotiations relate to the review mechanisms proposed in the draft withdrawal agreement. This would be overseen by a joint committee including UK and EU representatives, with disputes ruled on by an arbitration committee.The AG’s advice appears to point to the risk of the UK getting caught in endless discussions and disputes about whether the backstop is still needed under whatever new arrangements emerge.For the backstop to end, Cox warns, a superseding agreement is needed to take its place “in whole or in part”. And he concludes that the Withdrawal Agreement “cannot provide a legal means of compelling the EU to conclude such an agreement”. In other words, the UK has no unilateral way out of the backstop, and never will.Of course if the Withdrawal Agreement is not signed, then the UK does not sign up to the backstop and the Irish Border issue would again be back under discussion.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Neither Brussels nor Dublin will offer any concessions ahead of the Brexit vote to help British prime minister Theresa May win it. Photograph:  Ben StansallGetty Images During the second day of debate on Theresa May’s Brexit deal on Wednesday, the SNP’s Joanna Cherry compared Scotland’s voice in the negotiations with Ireland’s. The union that is the United Kingdom ignored Scotland as it pursued Brexit, she said, and sought to ignore the concerns of Ireland, North and South.“However, because the EU27 got behind the Irish Government’s legitimate concerns, they became central to the Brexit process. Conservative politicians – not all of them, but some – and indeed a few on the benches behind me, waited in vain for the EU27 to crack and throw Ireland under the bus. That did not happen, and it is not going to happen,” she said.She cited a remark by Mary Daly, professor of history at University College Dublin, that the current situation had uncanny echoes of what happened here 100 years ago “when the electric politics of Ulster determined what happened at Westminster”.The title of Daly’s most celebrated book The Slow Failure describes the likely fate of the prime minister’s Brexit deal as MPs debate it for a further 24 hours over three days. The politics of Northern Ireland and the backstop look set to sink the deal in next week’s vote, with up to 100 Conservative MPs threatening to oppose it.\u0026nbspThe prime minister promised MPs on Tuesday and again on Wednesday that she would look at ways of addressing their concerns about the backstop. But she has ruled out attempting to reopen the text of the withdrawal agreement and neither Brussels nor Dublin will offer any concessions ahead of the vote to help her win it.Even if she survives next week’s vote and can argue that her Brexit deal is still viable, EU leaders are unlikely to offer any immediate concessions. But if she is still in place in January and there is a chance to save the deal, the EU’s solidarity with Ireland so envied by Cherry will be put to the test.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Julien WarnandEPABritish prime minister Theresa May has signalled that MPs could be given the power to decide whether the UK goes into a controversial Brexit backstop arrangement that is designed to ensure an open Border in Ireland. Mrs May indicated the British parliament would choose between triggering the backstop or extending a transition period after the UK formally quits the EU.The move is likely to be seen as a bid to bolster flagging support ahead of a crunch House of Commons vote on her EU withdrawal agreement next Tuesday — a showdown she made clear she would not postpone.Mrs May told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There will be a choice between, if we get to that point, a choice between going into the backstop and extending the transition period.“Now, there are pros and cons of both sides of that.“People have a concern of the backstop, that we could be in it indefinitely.“But, in the backstop we have no financial obligations, we have no free movement, we have very light level playing field rules with the EU.“In the implementation period, we still have to negotiate the terms, but there will be concerns about the fact that they would require, I’m sure they would require, some more money to be paid, for example.“So there would be arguments on different sides.”Asked if she would be happy for Parliament to adjudicate on whether to go into the backstop or extend implementation, the PM said: “I think people are concerned about the role of the UK in making these decisions.“And, the obvious, in terms of the UK, is for it to be Parliament that makes these decisions.”The backstop, intended to prevent the return of a hard Border in Northern Ireland, is highly controversial as Brexiteer MPs claim it traps the UK into obeying rules set by Brussels without a say over them.The British government insists it aims to conclude a comprehensive trade deal with the EU before a backstop arrangement would be needed.Mrs May said that any deal with the EU, such as a Canada-style free trade agreement favoured by some Brexiteers, would also require a backstop arrangement.Mrs May’s comments came as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) insisted it will withdraw support for her Government if the Prime Minister presses ahead with the Brexit deal with the EU.Asked if the DUP was prepared to precipitate a general election, the party’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “If it comes to the point where the Government makes, shows, a determination to implement the Withdrawal Agreement with its damaging terms at present, or some future version of it, which is still equally damaging, we will not be supporting the Government.”Meanwhile a European Court of Justice ruling on the reversibility of Article 50 will take place the day before MPs vote on Mrs May’s Brexit deal, the court has announced.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

coalition spreads confusion vaccinations sacking commission","story":"Since coming to power in June, Italy\u0026#39s coalition has sown confusion over its policy on vaccinesItaly’s populist coalition has plunged its already confusing stance on vaccines into greater uncertainty by sacking a commission of health experts.The decision was announced by Giulia Grillo, the health minister, who said it was “time to make room” for new people on the commission, which governments normally turn to for health advice.“We are the government of change,” she said. “I have chosen to open the door to other deserving personalities.”But it was not clear who the replacements might be.The government, which is made up of the hard-Right League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, has sent out confusing signals about health policies, and in particular the importance of vaccinations, since it came to power in June.Both parties have been accused of peddling conspiracy theories about the supposed risks of having vaccinations.Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and deputy prime minister, has called them “useless and in many cases dangerous,” playing on discredited claims that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab can cause autism.The sacking of the health commission was met with consternation by health experts and criticism from opposition parties.Italy already has one of the worst records on measles cases and deaths from superbug infections in Europe. Both the Five Star Movement, led by Luigi di Maio (L) and The League, led by Matteo Salvini, have expressed scepticism over the need for vaccinationsRoberta Siliquini, the outgoing president of the commission, said: “Given the quality of the members that make up the council, I don\u0027t see any scientific reason for the decision.”Dr Siliquini, who is the head of the school of hygiene and preventive medicine at Turin University, said she had never met the minister since the government was appointed in June.Like the other members of the commission, Dr Siliquini was appointed last December by the previous, centre-Left government.Their term was supposed to have lasted for three years.“It’s a decision that leaves us frankly astounded,” said Maria Rizzotti, an MP with the centre-Right Forza Italia party.“We have no idea why the minister removed, two years early, the members who were appointed to the commission in December 2017.The decision appeared to be a “political purge”, she said. “An advisory body as important as the Higher Health Council must not be deprived of experts of the highest level,” she said.Vasco Errani, from the centre-Left party Free and Equal, said it was “incomprehensible” that the minister had never met the commission’s experts and accused the coalition of operating a “spoils system” of politically-motivated appointments.The government has said that vaccinations should be voluntary, not obligatory, despite the risk of infectious diseases spreading, particularly among children in schools and nurseries.The number of measles cases has risen dramatically in ItalyBut to add confusion to the government’s stance, Ms Grillo admitted during the summer, when she was pregnant, that she would definitely have her baby vaccinated.She said that parents should be allowed to “self-certify” that their children have had the required jabs at the start of the academic year in September, rather than be required to produce doctors’ notes.The commission of experts recommended just last month that 800,000 children and young adults should be vaccinated against measles amid what it called an “emergency” over the rising number of cases.At the time Ms Grillo, the minister, appeared to endorse that call.Rising scepticism over the need for vaccinations has resulted in a sharp rise in the number of measles cases in Italy, from around 850 in 2016 to 5,000 cases last year.Please review our commenting policyRefusal to give pregnant women vaccines branded

All other sports will be included.Dr Heather\u0026nbspWardle\u0026nbspof the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine welcomed the news but said the proposed restrictions are just the start.Gambling is heavily advertised and marketed online, through social media and through sponsorship – where it is very difficult to control who receives these messages, Dr Wardle said.\u0026nbspThe system needs to be considered as a whole, but suggestions to stop adverts around football matches is a good starting place.The proof, however, is in the pudding as we wait to see how this is implemented, what the responses of other companies are to this and how companies may compensate in other areas.”Online casinos hit with millions in fines amid regulator clampdownMore than 50,000 under-17s have gambling problems, report revealsAgree with the FOBTs crackdown? Don\u0027t be fooled by the gambling lobbyNine in 10 pubs fail to prevent children gambling on their premisesMatt Zarb-Cousin of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said pressure had forced online gambling firms to act.“This is long overdue, but to be truly effective it must include all operators and should also commit to bans on shirt and league sponsorship, and pitch-side scrolling displays,” he added.Gambling Commission figures released last week estimated that 430,000 people in the UK are problem gamblers.While the number has remained relatively stable there are growing fears that 24-7 access to online gambling through apps, fuelled by ads before the watershed have put addicts at greater risk.Despite making billions in profits last year the gambling industry contributes just £10m towards research and treatment – 0.1 per cent of turnover.\u0026nbspDr Wardle\u0026nbspdescribed the amount as a “pittance” compared to the amount needed to tackle gambling-related harm.She and a group of other leading experts and campaigners in the field are supporting a mandatory industry levy of 1 per cent of profits which would bring in more than £130m a year.The Gambling Commission last week announced three operators of online casinos would pay a combined £14m for failing to properly protect vulnerable gamblers and prevent money laundering.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Equally, I want T-level students, that want to, to be able to go to university to do relevant technical degrees.”Mr Hinds will announce the next seven T-level courses to be taught from 2021,\u0026nbspwhich will include programmes in health, science, construction, and digital services.The first T-level courses will be taught in further education and post-16 providers from 2020.Speaking at an event in London this morning, Mr Hinds will add: “As a nation I’m afraid we’ve been technical education snobs. We’ve revered the academic but treated vocational as second class. When we do it well -\u0026nbsplaw, engineering, medicine -\u0026nbspthen we don’t even call it vocational.“Why has this has been tolerated for so long? I think the reason is the “OPC” problem. For so many opinion formers, commentators and, yes, politicians: vocational courses are for ‘other people’s children’.”Tom Berwick, chief executive of the Federation of Awarding Bodies (FAB), who has previously raised concerns about the implementation of the T-levels, said: “The principle of a genuinely world-class and equitable technical route for young people will be broadly welcomed.”He added: “However, the elephant in the room is securing proper investment in further education which has seen its funding cut significantly in the last decade.“The government needs a more coherent plan post-18 that links increased investment in productivity with better incentives for providers and employers to meet the skills the country needs.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators for and against Brexit protest opposite the Houses of ParliamentTheresa May has suffered an unprecedented defeat after the government was found to be in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish key Brexit papers.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

Zuckerberg agreed to senior executive Justin\u0026nbspOsofsky’s request in 2013 to stop giving friends’ list access to Vine on the day that social media rival Twitter launched the video-sharing service. “We’ve prepared reactive PR,” Mr\u0026nbspOsofsky\u0026nbspwrote, to which Mr Zuckerberg replied: “Yup, go for it.”The documents also raised questions about Facebook’s transparency. An exchange from 2015 shows Facebook leaders discussing how to begin collecting call logs from Android users’ smartphones without subjecting them to “scary” permissions screens.In a summary of the 250-page cache, which includes internal emails involving Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and other members of staff,\u0026nbspDamian\u0026nbspCollins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, highlighted a number of “key issues”.Sandberg asked staff to probe Soros after his attack on tech companiesHe claimed the documents show Facebook chose to “whitelist” selected companies, allowing them to maintain “full access” to the data of a user’s Facebook friends even after the company announced changes in 2015 to end such access.Mr Collins suggested the cache also showed Facebook regularly discussed the value of data on the platform, and said: “The idea of linking access to friends’ data to the financial value of the developers’ relationship with Facebook is a recurring feature of the documents.”He added that the files also showed Facebook knew an update to its Android mobile app that would allow it to collect user call logs would be controversial and “to mitigate any bad PR Facebook planned to make it as hard as possible for users to know that this was one of the underlying features of the upgrade of their app”.Created with Sketch.How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Lock your profile downIf you haven’t done this already, do it now.

Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu.Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who’s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. It’s worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. 89 Change your ad preferencesYou can view a list of everything Facebook thinks you’re into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts.

The summary said the site used this data to assess how often people use these apps and then to decide on which companies to acquire and which to treat as a threat.The internal workings of Facebook were revealed after parliament released the internal documents from the controversial company. The files show a range of discussions from inside Facebook, including suggestions that it could one day charge developers for access to its data about users.\u0026nbsp“There’s a big question on where we get the revenue from,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in one email. “Do we make it easy for devs to use our paymentsad network but not require them? Do we require them? Do we just charge a rev share directly and let devs who use them get a credit against what they owe us? It’s not at all clear to me here that we have a model that will actually make us the revenue we want at scale.”\u0026nbspThe documents were released as the company is hit by a range of scandals about how Facebook uses the vast array of personal data it collects about its users.Facebook users logged out as site stops working properlyThe documents were released by parliament’s media committee, which is running an investigation into those scandals and Facebook more generally, and are files seized from a now-defunct swimsuit photo searching app as part of that investigation. They show that Facebook deeply considered the issues that would go on to produce a range of scandals, including the Cambridge\u0026nbspAnalytica\u0026nbspaffair.The committee received the documents from app developer\u0026nbspSix4Three, which had acquired the files dating from 2013-2014, as part of a US lawsuit against the social media giant. The app developer is suing Facebook over a change to the social network’s privacy policies in 2015 that led\u0026nbspSix4Three\u0026nbspto shut down its app,\u0026nbspPikinis, which let users find photos of their friends in bathing suits by searching their friends list.\u0026nbspUS senator Richard\u0026nbspBlumenthal\u0026nbspdescribed the documents as part of “mounting evidence that Facebook acted chaotically, recklessly and lawlessly by granting access to private consumer data for financial gain”.Facebook responded quickly, saying the release was misleading. “The documents\u0026nbspSix4Three\u0026nbspgathered for their baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context,” the statement said. “We stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends’ data with developers.“Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform. But the facts are clear: we’ve never sold people’s data.”The firm said it would relax one “out of date” policy that restricted competitors’ use of its data. Previously, “Mark level signoff” would have been required for an exemption to the policy, according to one document, referring to Mr Zuckerberg.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

All other sports will be included.Dr Heather\u0026nbspWardle\u0026nbspof the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine welcomed the news but said the proposed restrictions are just the start.Gambling is heavily advertised and marketed online, through social media and through sponsorship – where it is very difficult to control who receives these messages, Dr Wardle said.\u0026nbspThe system needs to be considered as a whole, but suggestions to stop adverts around football matches is a good starting place.The proof, however, is in the pudding as we wait to see how this is implemented, what the responses of other companies are to this and how companies may compensate in other areas.”Online casinos hit with millions in fines amid regulator clampdownMore than 50,000 under-17s have gambling problems, report revealsAgree with the FOBTs crackdown? Don\u0027t be fooled by the gambling lobbyNine in 10 pubs fail to prevent children gambling on their premisesMatt Zarb-Cousin of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said pressure had forced online gambling firms to act.“This is long overdue, but to be truly effective it must include all operators and should also commit to bans on shirt and league sponsorship, and pitch-side scrolling displays,” he added.Gambling Commission figures released last week estimated that 430,000 people in the UK are problem gamblers.While the number has remained relatively stable there are growing fears that 24-7 access to online gambling through apps, fuelled by ads before the watershed have put addicts at greater risk.Despite making billions in profits last year the gambling industry contributes just £10m towards research and treatment – 0.1 per cent of turnover.\u0026nbspDr Wardle\u0026nbspdescribed the amount as a “pittance” compared to the amount needed to tackle gambling-related harm.She and a group of other leading experts and campaigners in the field are supporting a mandatory industry levy of 1 per cent of profits which would bring in more than £130m a year.The Gambling Commission last week announced three operators of online casinos would pay a combined £14m for failing to properly protect vulnerable gamblers and prevent money laundering.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Expect to see the likes of A Star Is Born, Roma and The Favourite in contention for the film trophies.That’s not all: the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), which runs the event, is also teasing a “major announcement” that will be revealed during the press conference taking place in Los Angeles at 1pm GMT.Follow along with all the nominations as they’re announced in our live blog below.Killing Eve\u0027s Sandra Oh and Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Andy Samberg\u0026nbsphave been announced as the 2019 hostsThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) is also teasing a major announcementYou can find a list of all the films and TV shows vying for success in our live blog\u0026nbspthroughout the dayAlso worth remembering voters enjoy nominating shows that have come to an end so The Americans should get some love.And then there\u0027s the limited series which\u0027ll (probs) see American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, A Very English Scandal and Sharp Objects nominated.Comedy wise, all eyes are on Amazon sensation The Marvellous Mrs Maisel.Will former critical darlings House of Cards and Westworld make the cut? We\u0027re gonna say the former will most definitely will be shunned.In the drama category, expect to see Killing Eve lead the pack with The Handmaid\u0027s Tale, This Is Us and Homecoming\u0026nbsptrailing.Okay okay, so film doesn\u0027t get all the love at the Globes because it\u0027s shared with TV because there really is no difference these days.Despite strong competition from Nicole who\u0027s gone all Virginia Woolf once again for her role in Destroyer, it\u0027s Gaga\u0027s for the taking.Her closest competitors include Nicole Kidman (Destroyer) Glenn Close (The Wife), Viola Davis (Widows), and Natalie Portman for crazy dance film Vox Lux.Before you start thinking this is the year Lady Gaga could *shock horror* win a Golden Globe, don\u0027t go forgetting she already won one back in 2016 for American Horror Story: Hotel.Supporting Actor wise, it should look a lot like this:Sam Elliott for A Star Is BornAdam Driver for BlacKkKansmanTimothee Chalamet for Beautiful BoyMahershala Ali for Green Book (if they lump him in supporting)Actress-wise, it looks like Olivia Colman\u0027s to lose\u0026nbspwho is long overdue international awards success tbh. She\u0027s come a looooong way since Peep Show.If it\u0027s going to get anything, it\u0027s for Freddie Mercury star Rami Malek who\u0027ll face competition from the aforementioned Bale, Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali (both for Green Book) and Robert Redford for *his last screen role*\u0026nbspThe Old Man and the Gun.The big question is: will Queen film Bohemian Rhapsody get a nod? (Most) critics didn\u0027t like it, audiences loved it, yadda yadda.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place. He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight.

Huawei has a robust cyber security assurance system and a proven track record.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But, argue\u0026nbspJohn Curtice\u0026nbspand his co-authors in a new book edited by Philip Cowley and Denis Kavanagh, the real Brexit referendum actually happened a year laterClick to followThe IndependentThe social geography of the 2017 general election was shaped by attitudes towards BrexitIf voters agreed with the prime minister that the 2017 general election was about Brexit, then – given that her vision of Britain’s future relationship with the EU was widely regarded as representing a “hard” Brexit (prioritising control of immigration over continued membership of the EU single market) – we might expect her party to have advanced more strongly in places where the previous year a relatively high proportion had voted to leave the EU.Our analysis suggests this is precisely what happened. The higher the estimated vote for Leave in 2016, the more the Conservative vote increased, while support for the party actually fell back on average in places where Leave failed to secure at least 45 per cent of the vote.\u0026nbspThe link between Labour’s performance and the strength of the Leave vote in 2016 is much weaker, a finding that might be thought to reflect the party’s relatively ambiguous position on Brexit.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersThere was only a three-point difference between the increase in the Labour vote in places where 60 per cent or more voted to Leave and the equivalent figure for constituencies where less than 45 per cent voted to Leave – far less than the corresponding difference of 12 points in the Conservative performance.Even so, between them these two patterns are sufficiently strong that in seats where more than 60 per cent voted to Leave, there was on average a net (total vote) swing of 0.8 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives, even though everywhere else in England and Wales Labour’s vote increased more than that of the Conservatives.Where did the Ukip vote go?A key reason why the link between the Conservative performance and the strength of the Leave vote is much stronger than that for Labour lies in the impact on the two parties’ performances of the collapse in the Ukip vote.Ukip’s share of the vote in the 2015 election was much larger in areas where Leave did well in the referendum. The decline in Ukip support two years later was almost invariably greatest where the party had previously been strongest. If those who voted Ukip in 2015 (nearly all of whom voted to Leave in 2016) were now particularly inclined to switch to the Conservatives, this could have served to boost the Conservative performance in constituencies that voted heavily to Leave.Indeed, while Labour\u0026nbspappears to have won some of the voters that Ukip lost, the Conservatives apparently gained many more.Ukip in 2017 was almost invariably greatest in areas where the party had been strongest before (Getty)Nevertheless, the collapse in Ukip support is far from being the whole explanation for the strong Conservative performance in areas keenest on leaving the EU. Even when we take into account how heavily Ukip support fell, the Conservatives still performed better where the Leave vote was stronger in 2016.Where did Remain and Leave voters go? The Conservative Party did not do well in places where Leave was strong in 2016 only because of the pattern of switching among\u0026nbspformer Ukip voters rather, Leave voters more generally seem to have been drawn into voting Conservative at this election, while Remain voters tilted towards Labour.Support for Ukip in 2015 and for Leave in 2016 varied substantially by age and educational background. Both were particularly popular with older people and those with few or no formal educational qualifications, while younger people and graduates tended to shun Ukip and vote Remain. This pattern was reflected in the Conservative and Labour votes in 2017.Created with Sketch.EU referendum - in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman in a wheelchair with British and European Union flags shows her support for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union on the day of the EU Referendum in GibraltarA polling station being used in the EU referendum at Batley Town Hall in the constituency Labour MP Jo CoxPeople arrive to vote in the EU Referendum at the Library where British MP Jo Cox was shot and fatally wounded last week in BirstallA man arrives to vote at a polling station for the Referendum on the European Union in north LondonVoters queue to enter a polling station at Trinity Church in Golders Green in LondonBritish Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha Cameron leave after voting in the EU Referendum at Central Methodist Hall, Westminster Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn cast his vote at a polling station at Pakeman Primary School in IslingtonChelsea pensioners arrive at a polling station near to the Royal Chelsea HospitalA woman wearing an I\u0027m In t-shirt, promoting the official Remain campaign, leaves a polling station in LondonPeople queuing outside a polling station on Amott Road in LondonScotland\u0027s First Minister and Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, react as leave after casting their votes at a polling station at Broomhouse Community Hall in east GlasgowA man wearing a European themed cycling jersey leaves after voting at a polling station for the Referendum on the European Union in north LondonUkip leader Nigel Farage arrives to cast his vote at Cudham Church of England Primary School in Biggin Hill, KentJustice Secretary and prominent \u0027Vote Leave\u0027 campaigner Michael Gove poses with his wife Sarah Vine after voting in the European Union referendum at their local polling station in KensingtonNuns leave a polling station after voting in the EU Referendum in LondonPeople arrive to cast their ballots in the EU Referendum in Gibraltar.

There is a corresponding, though much weaker tendency in the opposite direction for Labour. At the same time, the Conservatives performed less well and Labour better in seats with more young adults – though once we take this into account, there is no indication, despite the prominence given to Labour’s manifesto promise to scrap tuition fees for students at English universities, that constituencies with large numbers of students were particularly likely to swing towards the party.The social geography of Conservative and Labour performance at this election was primarily, albeit not entirely, a consequence of the role played by attitudes towards Brexit in shaping how people voted.What about the economy?Traditionally, the state of the economy has played a central role in how people vote. In 2015, for example, the Conservatives clearly performed worse where unemployment was highest or had increased most, and where household incomes were relatively low. At this election, however, if anything the opposite was the case.Revolutionary study into voter \u0027clans\u0027 holds key to 2022 electionThe worse local economic circumstances were, the better the Conservatives did and the worse Labour did. For instance, Conservative support increased on average by 5.8 points where the constituency unemployment rate increased between 2015 and 2017, compared with 4.9 points where it fell. The equivalent figures for Labour were 9.8 points and 10.4 points respectively. Moreover, despite a continued squeeze on public spending and a promise from the Conservatives of more austerity to come that could mean cuts in public sector jobs, there was, in contrast to 2015, no particular relationship between Conservative or Labour performance and the local prevalence of public sector employees.Did the antisemitism row hurt Labour?Not that the focus on Brexit meant that nothing else mattered. Jeremy Corbyn’s views on the Middle East have attracted particular controversy, with critics accusing the Labour leader of being too sympathetic to iniduals and groups opposed to Israel, including some widely regarded as extremist. There were related accusations that, under Corbyn’s leadership, the Labour Party had dealt inadequately with allegations that some party members have made antisemitic statements. These issues appear to have made a difference. On average Labour’s vote increased by 11.6 points in constituencies where more than 4 per cent are Muslim, compared with an average increase of 9.6 points elsewhere in England and Wales. This difference is not accounted for by the tendency of the Leave vote to be lower in seats with more Muslims. Meanwhile, and by contrast, the Labour vote only rose by 8.8 points on average across the 10 constituencies with the largest Jewish populations, even though seven of these 10 seats are in London, where Labour generally performed relatively well.Did social class drive the voting?However, the fallout from the EU referendum was most important in shaping the geography of Conservative and Labour performance. In so doing, the contest served to reduce some of the traditional isions in British elections. For example, although working-class voters had traditionally been the bedrock of Labour support, they had also been more likely to vote Leave and to vote for Ukip. Thus, thanks to its gains among such voters, at this election Conservative support increased by as much as 9.4 points in seats where more than 13 per cent are engaged in a routine manual occupation, compared with just 1.3 points where fewer than 10 per cent have a routine job. Conversely, Labour’s support increased by just 9.1 points in relatively working-class seats, but by 10.7 points where relatively few have a routine job.\u0026nbspWhat happened to the northsouth ide?Equally, the northsouth ide in Britain’s electoral geography also narrowed somewhat, the first time it has done so since 1997. A relatively weak Conservative performance and a relatively strong Labour performance across the largely more pro-Remain south of England\u0026nbspmeant that on average there was as much as a 3.9 point swing from Conservative to Labour there.In contrast, the swing to Labour was only 1.3 in the north of England and 0.7\u0026nbspin the heavily pro-Leave Midlands. One striking consequence of this ergence is that Conservative support is now higher in the Midlands than in the south of England, not least, but also not solely, because pro-Remain and ethnically erse London has now become something of a Labour citadel.Paxman returned to Newsnight to interrogate May and Corbyn (Getty)Despite initial appearances, therefore, this clearly was not an election that heralded a return to the familiar patterns of two-party politics.Do constituency boundaries hold the key?But what about the notion that the makeup of parliament is as much to do with the way constituency boundaries have been drawn as anything else? That question is particularly topical, given current proposals for boundary reform. \u0026nbspThe present constituency boundaries are biased against the Conservatives, but this is compensated for by the more efficient distribution of their vote.Surprising though the failure of the Conservatives to win an overall majority last year might have seemed, was the tally of seats won by each party significantly different from what we might have anticipated given the shares of the vote each of them secured?\u0026nbspThe traditional way of addressing this question has been to compare the actual outcome in seats with what would have happened if in every constituency each party’s share of the vote had increased or fallen in line with the change in its overall share of the vote across Britain as a whole – that is, uniform change.However, applying this method becomes difficult when, as happened in 2015 and again in 2017, there is a substantial change in the level of support for a party, such as the SNP, that only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there. In these circumstances the change in that party’s share of the Britain-wide vote will inevitably be but a pale reflection of the actual rise or fall in its support in the part of the UK where it stood.It is therefore better to use as our initial benchmark what would have happened if support for all of the main Britain-wide parties had increased or fallen in every constituency in England and Wales in line with the overall change in their support in those two parts of the UK combined. For each seat in Scotland, meanwhile, we calculate what would have happened if the rise or fall in each party’s support had been in line with the change in its share of the Scotland-wide total.On the basis of these assumptions, the Conservatives would have won 323 seats (instead of 318), Labour 259 (262), the SNP 37 (35), the Liberal Democrat nine (12), Plaid Cymru three (four) and the Greens one (one), while, of course, there would be 18 other MPs from Northern Ireland. None of these figures are\u0026nbspvery different from what actually transpired and, above all, the Conservatives would still have failed to secure an overall majority – albeit they would have been only three rather than eight seats short.What about Scotland?That projected Conservative tally includes 11 seats in Scotland. However, if the increase in the Conservative vote north of the border had been in line with the lower increase in England and Wales – and the fall in SNP support had not happened – the Conservatives would have won only two Scottish seats. Thus, in the absence of the distinctive outcome in Scotland, the Conservatives would have won only 314 seats. To that extent, the distinctive result in Scotland proved to be crucial to the arithmetic of the new House of Commons.SNP only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there (Getty)What were the other factors?However, although the overall tally of seats for each party was more or less in line with what might have been expected given the changes in their overall shares of the vote, there were lots of seats where the outcome was at variance with what would have happened if the movements in party support had been the same everywhere.What if Nick Clegg had gone into coalition with Labour in 2010?No fewer than 36 seats changed hands that would not have done so under those circumstances, while 16 constituencies were held against the tide. Most of these outcomes can in fact be accounted for by one or other of the systematic patterns of variation our analysis has identified, including the tendency for the Conservatives to perform better in seats with a relatively large Leave vote and Labour to do likewise in seats where Remain polled relatively well, the Conservatives’ ability on occasion to squeeze the other unionist parties in Scotland, and the willingness of some of those who might otherwise have voted Labour to make a tactical switch to the (pro-Remain) Liberal Democrats. In short, much of the significant variation in party performance was linked in some way or other to the fallout from either the 2016 EU referendum or the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.Dem leader Tim Farron narrowly retained his seat with 8.4 per cent swing to the Tories (Getty)This still leaves us with the observation that for the third time in a row, the electoral system failed to deliver the winning party a substantial overall majority (and, indeed, on two occasions any majority at all).The system’s ability to generate safe overall majorities has long been regarded as a hallmark of the single member plurality system (often referred to as “first past the post”) and the resulting clarity of the link between the outcome of an election and who forms the government is often cited as a major justification for its continued use.It might be thought the explanation is that, at 2.5 points, the Conservative lead over Labour in terms of votes across Great Britain as a whole was a relatively narrow one. It was certainly much narrower than the seven point leads that the Conservatives enjoyed in 2010 and 2015. Yet it was larger than the leads (in Great Britain) that the Conservatives enjoyed in 1955 (1.9 points) and 1970 (2.3 points) or Labour did in 1964 (1.9 points), yet those three contests all resulted in an overall majority, including in two instances a relatively safe one.Historical precedent apparently suggests that the Conservative lead should have been sufficient to give the party an overall majority.What about variable constituency sizes?One consequence of the prime minister’s decision to secure a Commons vote for an early election is that the contest had to be fought on the same constituency boundaries as in 2015 and not on the new boundaries the various parliamentary boundary commissions were in the midst of preparing in readiness for an election in 2020.The resulting inequality in the sizes of constituencies was certainly a disadvantage for the Conservatives. The average electorate in constituencies they won at this election was 74,451, whereas in seats won by Labour it was 70,529. The difference of some 3,920 people was around 520 bigger than it had been two years previously.The gap may have been increased somewhat by the government’s decision in 2015 to speed up the introduction of inidual electoral registration, which resulted in particularly sharp drops in registration in some typically Labour-held constituencies with large numbers of students. But the gap was then narrowed somewhat by the applications to be added to the register many (and especially younger) voters made after its initial compilation in December 2016. These added 2,300 names on average to the register in constituencies that Labour won, compared with just 1,600 on average in seats won by the Conservatives.Did voter turnout make a difference?However, inequalities in the registered electorate are not the only consideration that we have to bear in mind in considering the sizes of constituencies. Bias might also arise if turnout is lower in seats held by one party than it is in those won by its opponents. Indeed, turnout was on average some four points lower on average in seats won by Labour at this election (66.5 per cent) than it was in those won by the Conservatives (70.7 per cent).\u0026nbspAFPGetty)That said, this was a noticeably smaller gap than in 2015, for turnout increased on average by 3.8 points in seats Labour won, but by only 2.0 points in those won by the Conservatives. As a result, at 5,675 votes, the difference between Conservative and Labour-held seats in terms of the total number of votes cast was actually smaller at this election than it had been in the same two sets of seats two years previously (6,541).To this we need to add one other consideration. The relative success of the Conservatives in seats with a relatively high Leave vote meant that the increase in the party’s vote was often greater in more working-class seats outside of London and the south of England, whose populations have grown less rapidly and thus tend to have lower than average electorates.For example, Conservative support increased on average by as much as 7.3 points in seats in which fewer than 72,000 people were registered to vote, compared with just 4.3 points where more than 77,000 names appeared on the register. Similarly, while the Conservative vote increased on average by 9.7 points where turnout was less than 65 per cent, it increased by just 3.2 points where turnout was above 71 per cent. As a result, there was a noticeable reduction in the extent to which the Conservative vote was concentrated in constituencies where more people turned out to vote.Created with Sketch.

The Labour Party was ahead of the Conservatives by more than 40 points in 27 per cent of seats that it won, while the Conservative Party was that far ahead of Labour in just 12 per cent of the constituencies that it won.\u0026nbspIn short, whatever disadvantage the Conservatives suffered as a result of inequalities in the sizes of constituencies tended to be compensated by them having a more efficiently distributed vote.John\u0026nbspCurtice, Strathclyde University, Stephen Fisher, Trinity College, Oxford, and Robert Ford and Patrick English, University of Manchester, are authors of The Results Analysed, in ‘The British General Election of 2017’, edited by Philip Cowley and Dennis\u0026nbspKavanagh, from which this article is extractedShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

For decades protesters have demanded they be repurposed as social housing.\u0026nbspOliver Bennett unravels the highs and lows of a phenomenon with global foundationsClick to followThe IndependentSquatters occupy Centre Point, advocating its use as a residential block instead of an office in the SeventiesCentre Point must be one of the most isive landmarks in London. Erected in 1966, it instantly dominated the West End and while some celebrated it –\u0026nbsparchitect Erno\u0026nbspGoldfinger called it “London’s first pop art skyscraper”\u0026nbspand amazingly, likened it in spirit to The Beatles and Mary Quant – the brainchild of reclusive developer Harry Hyams has had a mixed reception over its 52 years.But perhaps Centre Point’s most curious fate has been to remain more or less empty. It never fully worked as offices. In 1972 Camden Council tried to requisition it. Harold Wilson wanted to nationalise it. It was occupied for a weekend by housing activists in 1974 – one was Labour politician Jack Dromey, Harriet Harman’s husband. A major homelessness charity was named after it. Then a Grade-II listing and a recherché desire for Brutalist\u0026nbspicons (it came from the feted drawing board of Richard Seifert’s master architect, George Marsh) bought its zig-zag façade back into favourable view and it become luxury flats, synced to the new Crossrail development. What could go wrong?Labour mulls plan to force landowners to sell cheap to stateWell, the Centre Point curse has struck again. In October its developer Almacantar decided that offers on its remaining luxury flats were “derisory” and “detached from reality”, and decided to take them off the market. So Centre Point has now cemented and updated its footnote in London folklore as one of the capital’s benighted\u0026nbsp“ghost towers”.From Centre Point to the Shard, from Battersea Power Station to the sky-reaching baubles of Nine Elms\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspeven in The Independent’s old neighbourhood in City Road – the past six years or so has seen London become filled with tall glass and steel icons\u0026nbspthat are conspicuously under-occupied: built in a time of optimism for an overseas market and now languishing unsold or OLE: owned and left empty.The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supplyThe immediate prognosis is not good. It has been said that half the 1,900 luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, and it’s estimated that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 unsold but complete luxury new builds, with many still entering the market. Property analyst Molior London noted that sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth last year, and that the number\u0026nbspof unsold apartments continues to grow. And the more expensive they are, the more likely they are to be unoccupied: 39 per cent\u0026nbspfor homes worth £1m to £5m, 64 per cent\u0026nbspfor those places over £5m. There are reports of people trying hard to sell and to complicate matters, there’s the impending known-unknown that is Brexit.It seems an odd characteristic of the past 10\u0026nbspyears that things have been so difficult for buyers in one direction and so easy in the other. These luxury apartments are commonly between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft, against the average UK price of £211 per sq ft. But, their posh locations aside, one of their key drivers has been the post credit-crunch migration of capital.“We’ve seen an\u0026nbspera of low interest and cash into assets,” says Henry Pryor, a property-buying agent. “When money is unsafe, or doesn’t inflate, the rich put it into other things: cars, art, houses.”The high-water mark was about six or seven years ago when then mayor Boris Johnson went on a spending spree and encouraged others to do likewise. London became what Pryor calls a “speculation paradise” – and that spike is now heading in the opposite direction.So, if housing is a free market that can go up as well as down, why does Almacantar not take the hit with its Centre Point flats and sell them for less? “It doesn’t work like that,” says Michael Ball of the Waterloo Community Development Group and a seasoned housing activist. “The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supply.”Battersea\u0026nbspPower Station sat empty for\u0026nbspyears but is now being developed as a retail\u0026nbspand residential space (AFPGetty)The seeds of the current zombie-tower wobbles came with George Osborne’s stamp duty reforms in 2014, which took the froth off the market, leading to developer grumbles – wasn’t he one of us, they wailed? Then the long lead-time of developments began to show as a significant constraint, for as well as “skyscraper syndrome”\u0026nbsp(where a glut of tall building supposedly presages a downturn) there’s also the problem that many developments are financed by upfront sales.“Many were designed to be sold off-plan to release capital for building,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision. “Now people are waiting until properties are actually built, which squeezes developers badly.” Increased scrutiny on money laundering may also play a part which, as Pryor says, “is still too easy”.Plus, some high-end properties were simply never meant to be\u0026nbsplived in but just to be “gold bars in the sky” as Ball puts it. It’s hard to find out how many of London’s luxury flats are truly unoccupied. “You can look at census, but it’s tough to find out numbers,” says Ball. “I don’t think we know the extent of it. The records are really poor.” And as ever with property, the winners crow and the losers remain silent.There are a few other factors to observe, including the move of real estate into a high-end branded fashion buy, as the Candy Brothers did with their developments. “That aspect took me by surprise,” says Pryor. “It turned out that people wanted to be able to specify that they had a Candy apartment as they sat in Monaco, as if boasting about owning a Bulgari watch or a Montblanc pen.”There’s also an argument that some parts of London, such as Eaton Square in Belgravia, have long acted as pieds-à-terre for the rich and were probably ghost-like in the 18th and 19th centuries. “Remember, in Downton Abbey they occasionally come down to ‘Grantham House’ in London,” says Adam Challis, head of residential research at real estate company JLL.“That old ‘country seat and the London house’ combination is now a global rather than national phenomenon, and a London apartment became part of a wider property portfolio.” He points out that while these spectral apartments may appear unoccupied, it could well be that their ultra-rich owners may only use them for six to eight weeks a year.I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places.\u0026nbspIt would be a disasterNine Elms is a typical new London “owned and left empty”\u0026nbspzone. A swathe of land between Battersea and Vauxhall, it was a low-value industrial hinterland dominated by the Cold Store –\u0026nbspa piece of charismatic dereliction used in an episode of The Sweeney – and the only respite being London’s flower market. Now it’s a parade of gleaming hi-tech towers.“When private developers get hold of the land it leaps in value tenfold,” says Michael Ball. So in a way, however many apartments have been sold here, it may have already fulfilled its profit promise. Sometimes, adds Scarisbrick, such places are not even designed for full occupancy. “I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places,” he says. “It would be a disaster.”US politicians question Trump\u0027s ties to scandal-struck Panama projectHow drones are revolutionising construction and real estateThere are precedents to all this. In earlier eras luxury housing went up as well as down, and lost out to new tastes. Michael Ball says that St Georges Buildings\u0026nbspin the Elephant and Castle area was built as a luxury development in the 1880s. “By the post-war era it had become squatted, then became social housing. Now it’s luxury housing again.”The ghost tower phenomenon isn’t confined to London or the UK. There are similar qualms in South Africa, Canada, New York and Mumbai, where a string of luxury skyscrapers in the Worli and Prabhadevi districts have recently struggled to find buyers. Emptiness is a fact of life in the construction industry and just last month it was reported that a fifth of China’s new housing is empty: an extraordinary total of 50 million ghost homes. But another aspect of construction, says Challis, is that it attracts “huge economic growth. So empty homes are an endemic feature of the world’s most important cities.”The extent of London’s ghost towers may even have been overestimated. “Evidence from the LSE for Sadiq Khan showed that unlived-in apartments were actually under 1 per cent\u0026nbspof new build properties,” says Peter Murray of NLA, who adds that London properties are still selling well in Singapore and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, London has 510 tall buildings in the pipeline: up from 455 in 2016. Even with its current depredations, property in London is still considered a safer bet than many financial vehicles.But there’s no doubt that ghost towers fail the political and social smell test: as visible reminders of disposable wealth in a city where most can’t get a foothold.So, given that ghost towers and unsold luxury flats currently exist, whither their luxurious wenge-floored acres, gyms, pools and media rooms? Will developers have fire sales just to get rid of them? (Molior London has said that 10-15 per cent\u0026nbspreductions are typical and 20-30 per cent\u0026nbspreductions achievable, and that it would take more than\u0026nbspthree years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats at the current rate).Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe company has posted a series of messages making clear that it is working to fix the problems – though without explaining what is wrong.Our technical teams are investigating reports of issues when using data, O2\u0027s status page said.\u0026nbspVoice calls are working OK. Our technical teams are investigating.We apologise for any inconvenience. Updates will be shared here as soon they are available.A similar explanation was tweeted by O2\u0027s official account.We are aware our customers are unable to use data this morning, it posted.\u0026nbspOur technical teams are working on the issue with high priority. We are really sorry and working as hard and as fast as we can to fix this.It then posted a follow-up explaining the problem.Outage Update: One of our 3rd party suppliers has identified a software issue in their system, it tweeted.\u0026nbspOur technical teams are working extremely hard to resolve this. We\u0027d encourage you to use Wi-Fi wherever you can and we are really sorry.If you have been hit by the issues, there may be\u0026nbsplittle you can do. But here are some things to try in the meantime.While many people switch to GiffGaff or O2 for the deals, it is far from the most reliable of the data networks.According to Which, EE has the most reliable 4G, with people being able to get faster connections 87 per cent of the time. It also has faster mobile web connections than O2, according to the same survey.WiFi\u0026nbspconnections are still working, which might be little consolation if you\u0027re already out and trying to connect to the internet.But it is worth trying to see if you can get online using one: remember, for instance, you can get online at Tube stations by using their WiFi connections, and there might be open networks available if you are near a business. O2 customers may even have access to BT Openzone, which borrows people\u0027s in-home WiFi connections to allow you to get onto the internet.Once you\u0027re at work, you might also find there\u0027s a WiFi connection for employees that you\u0027ve never had to use because you can usually\u0026nbspget data. Now that you can\u0027t get data, it might be helpful to use that instead.When you\u0027re trying to fix your own data, there\u0027s not a great deal you can do. Sometimes, switching the connection on and off sometimes fixes problems like these – but isn\u0027t working this time around.Instead, you might just have to stay glued to The Independent\u0027s coverage for notification of when the network gets back up again.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That makes life challenging for us.OnePlus aims to go mainstream as it launches its ‘iPhone killer’“5G is going to open up a lot of new ways people use their smartphone – the increased speed combined with the increased capacity mean your smartphone can now truly be the centre of a connected experience, for everything from fitness to home automation.”The announcement that OnePlus’s\u0026nbspphone will be the first available in Europe comes despite the fact that other manufacturers – including giants like Samsung – have promised to bring their own devices to the network as soon as possible.Asked whether he was concerned that rivals would beat OnePlus to market despite its claim to being the first, Mr Lau said that there are “obviously no guarantees” but that his company were best positioned to be ready with the cutting-edge technology first.“We started working on 5G in 2016, and developed an R\u0026ampD lab with Qualcomm in 2017,” he said. “OnePlus has always used Qualcomm 800 series chipsets as part of our flagship-only strategy, and this is part of the reason for the excellent relationship we have with one of the world’s leading chipset providers.“No-one is better positioned than OnePlus to take the lead with 5G. We don’t really look at what others are doing in the industry, we’re focused on providing the best possible experience for our users, and we recognised early on that 5G would be a huge opportunity for revolution.”Others, such as Apple, are rumoured to have sat out the decision until at least 2020, allowing other companies to take the first leap – and deal with the potential for the kinds of major infrastructure problems that have blighted similar rollouts in the past. Mr Lau said that OnePlus would work hard to ensure those problems didn’t hit this time around.Created with Sketch.iPhone XS launch in September 2018 Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

Those early adopters know that, as with the launch of 4G, there won’t be 5G coverage everywhere at first but it’ll be a rapid rollout from networks.”Proponents have regularly suggested that 5G could change the way that people use phones, allowing people to take advantage of instant and reliable connections to create new forms of experience. Mr\u0026nbspLau\u0026nbspechoed those claims,\u0026nbspsuggesting they may be transformative in ways that the company has not even expected.“When you look at the history of smartphones, they’re used in ways today which no-one had designed them for originally,” he said.\u0026nbsp”5G will be the same – the possibilities will open up in front of us as people experiment with how to combine speed and capacity – everything from gaming through to work or fitness will change.

Wait until we actually leaveMeanwhile, a volley of tweets from Donald Trump punctured the optimism in markets that had followed news of a truce between the US and China.Just days after talks between the world’s two economic superpowers the US president once again fired off warning shots over trade,\u0026nbsptweeting: “We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States.\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future…”The president’s words helped to put downward pressure on the dollar as scepticism grew that Bejing and Washington would agree terms within the agreed 90-day window.Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM\u0026nbspsaid: “The tremors created from President Trump’s Twitter outbursts continue to illustrate how financial markets remain extremely sensitive to trade-related newsflow.“Although the Trump Administration has repeatedly blamed the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening for the unfavourable investor mood in stocks, the key culprit behind the selloff witnessed yesterday was clearly the comment made by Trump on trade with China.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That means in effect that it would be the inversion of normal mass: if you pushed it, it would be propelled towards you.We know even less about dark matter than we thought, scientists findThe implications of such a breakthrough suggestion are huge, offering a solution to what that vast amount of missing stuff might be.We now think that both dark matter and dark energy can be unified into a fluid which possesses a type of \u0027negative gravity\u0027, repelling all other material around them, said Dr Farnes.\u0026nbspAlthough this matter is peculiar to us, it suggests that our cosmos is symmetrical in both positive and negative qualities.Negative matter has been proposed before, since it would mean that the material would become less dense as the universe expands. That would contradict real observations, which shows that dark energy does not thin out over time.However, Dr Farnes\u0026nbsptheory suggests that new dark energy is being created all the time. Since more and more negative energy is constantly bursting into existence, such a fluid would not dilute even as the universe expanded.That proposed fluid appears to work exactly as dark energy does.The outcome seems rather beautiful: dark energy and dark matter can be unified into a single substance, with both effects being simply explainable as positive mass matter surfing on a sea of negative masses, he said.Researchers now hope the theory can be tested using the huge\u0026nbspSquare Kilometre Array, which is being built now and when finished will be the biggest telescope in the world. But if true it could fix\u0026nbspLambdaCDM, our current picture of the universe, explaining what exactly the dark matter and energy that has been so problematic for our physics is made up of.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Any deal, any agreement, any arrangement that we came to with the European Union would involve a backstop.So, people talk about, \u0027let\u0027s have a Norway, or let\u0027s have a Canada\u0027, everything involves a backstop.Ms May said she was in talks with MPs about how parliament can have a role going into that and coming out of the backstop, an controversial insurance policy to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland.Why trading on WTO terms under a no-deal Brexit is pure fantasyHammond warns no-deal Brexit will plunge UK into 1980s-style upheaval‘Very likely’ Leave won referendum because of illegal overspendingMay\u0027s last ditch plan to get Eurosceptics behind Brexit dealThe secret Brexit legal advice says what we thought it said – bluntlyShe refused to say if she had a plan B in case her deal was voted down, adding: That question is not for me, that question is for those who say that they want to oppose this deal.The prime minister also signalled that MPs could decide whether the UK went into a backstop or extended the transition period.It comes as the DUP\u0026nbsprestated their opposition to deal, saying they would bring down the government if Ms May\u0027s deal was approved.Asked directly if they would precipitate an election, Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said: If it comes to the point where the government makes, shows, a determination to implement the withdrawal agreement with its damaging terms at present, or some future version of it, which is still equally damaging, we will not be supporting the government.Created with Sketch.

He says the deal offers a sensible compromise that protects the economy, but also delivers on the result of the referendum? This is the right way to go, he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHammond says at the beginning of the process there were those inside the EU who wanted to hand down a punishment deal for the UK.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThis deal is the best deal for leaving the EU that is available or going to be available.\u0026nbspThe alternatives to this deal are no deal or no Brexit, he says - echoing the prime minister\u0027s warning of the risk of voting down the deal next week.\u0026nbspThe chancellor also dismisses the idea that the Brexit deal can be renegotiated as delusional.\u0026nbspHe adds that the backstop remains as ultimate default, but says the option remains on the table of extending the implementation period.The EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has insisted that the agreement with the PM was the only deal on offer - as MPs gear up to vote on the deal in five days\u0027 time.In a speech at the European Committee of the Regions, he said: I must say once again, today, calmly and clearly: It is the only and the best possible agreement.He added that Brexit was a lose-lose situation and the deal was an exercise in damage limitation.Andrea Leadsom - the Commons leader - is now speaking at business questions. She reiterates her opposition to producing government legal advice to Parliament - after Number 10 was forced to publish its advice on Wednesday.\u0026nbspShe says she can confirm the meaningful vote will go ahead next week.Steve Barclay - the new Brexit secretary - is making his debut in the Commons at Exiting the European Union questions. He told MPs there is not an absolute guarantee that the UK will continue to party to 40 trade deals signed by the EU with 70 countries.\u0026nbspHe made the remarks after Hillary Benn - a Labour MP - asked Mr Barclay to give assurances to business that trade agreements would continue to apply post-Brexit.\u0026nbspBreaking: The standards commissioner in parliament has ruled that Boris Johnson will have to make a formal apology to the Commons over the late declaration of nine payments amounting to over £50,000.\u0026nbsp​\u0026nbspThe Commissioner found that Mr Johnson acted in breach of the House’s rules on the registration of his financial interests. She found that registrations were late on four separate occasions, involving nine payments, which suggested a lack of attention to, or regard for, the House’s requirements.\u0026nbspThe Commissioner therefore concluded the breach was neither inadvertent or minor. She was consequently unable to rectify the complaint, and referred the matter to Committee on Standards.\u0026nbspThe Committee concluded that Mr Johnson breached the rules of the House by failing to register remuneration within the required timetable on nine occasions. In considering the appropriate sanction it took into account what it considered to be aggravating and mitigating factors, and recommended that Mr Johnson make an apology to the House on a Point of Order.\u0026nbspAppearing on the BBC\u0027s Radio 4 Today programme, Theresa May indicated she would go ahead with the crunch Commons vote next Tuesday - despite reports this morning that members of the cabinet are urging the prime minister to delay the vote due to high probability of defeat in five days\u0027 time.\u0026nbspShe said:\u0026nbspWe are in the middle of five days of debate in Parliament which will lead up to a vote on this issue.There are concerns about part of that withdrawal bit of the deal, which is what has come to be called the backstop.I recognise that there are those concerns. Any deal, any agreement, any arrangement that we came to with the European Union would involve a backstop.So, people talk about, \u0027let\u0027s have a Norway, or let\u0027s have a Canada\u0027, everything involves a backstop.\u0026nbspSecondly, none of the other arrangements that people have put forward fully deliver on the referendum. This deal delivers on the referendum.During the interview she also signalled\u0026nbspthat MPs would decide whether the UK went into a backstop or extended the transition period.There will be a choice between, if we get to that point, a choice between going into the backstop and extending the transition period, she said.\u0026nbspNow, there are pros and cons of both sides of that.\u0026nbspPeople have a concern of the backstop, that we could be in it indefinitely.But in the backstop we have no financial obligations, we have no free movement, we have very light level playing field rules with the EU.\u0026nbspIn the implementation period, we still have to negotiate the terms, but, there will be concerns about the fact that they would require, I\u0027m sure they would require, some more money to be paid, for example.\u0026nbspSo there would be arguments on different sides.Please allow a moment for the liveblog\u0026nbspto loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

A survey of parliamentary arithmetic currently suggests it will be rejected by a large margin.One Brussels official told The Independent: “We hope they\u0027re not going to try this because it\u0027s the same as ripping up the withdrawal agreement.”EU’s top court to rule on Article 50 before next week\u0027s vote on dealThroughout talks the EU and Irish government insisted that any border backstop would have to be “all-weather” and could not have a time-limit or other get-out clauses. The bloc\u0027s negotiators spent months in negotiations ruling out various mechanisms to end it early.The purpose of the legal mechanism is to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland no matter what else happens in Brexit talks.\u0026nbspThe policy would keep the UK tied to the EU’s customs territory after it left and ramp-up checks on some goods crossing the Irish sea. Both sides agree a hard border must not reappear, because of the Good Friday agreement.Unionist critics say the backstop is a breach of UK sovereignty because there would be checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, while Tory MPs fear it could be use to tie Britain indefinitely to a customs union, which they do not want.May forced to call Varadkar to calm Irish anger over borderEU softens Northern Ireland border \u0027backstop\u0027 plan in bid to ease dealMichel Barnier urges Theresa May to reconsider Irish border planTheresa May\u0027s Brexit plan \u0027would lead to hard border\u0027 with IrelandUnder the withdrawal agreement, if there is no other trade deal that would allow frictionless trade by 31 December 2020, both sides have agreed that the “backstop solution will apply until such a time as a subsequent agreement is in place”.But to avoid going into the backstop, UK can instead request an extension of the transition period – which effectively keeps the UK following all EU rules as if it was still a member, without any say on them.This extension can only be for a maximum of two years, and would have to be agreed by a “joint committee” of the EU and UK – meaning the EU could have a veto. As such, the UK will automatically enter the backstop under the withdrawal agreement, unless the EU agrees to prolong the transition.This makes Theresa May’s suggestion of a parliamentary lock on the backstop either hollow – or in violation of the withdrawal agreement.Also speaking on Thursday the\u0026nbspEU\u0027s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier insisted that the agreement was the only one\u0026nbspon offer.In a speech at the European Committee of the Regions, he said: I must say once again, today, calmly and clearly: It is the only and the best possible agreement.Created with Sketch.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He\u0026nbspalso opened a Twitter account to much fanfare in October.North Korea, another authoritarian country which strictly controls internet access, only allows its citizens to browse a nationwide intranet full of pages vetted by the regime.\u0026nbspCubans, however,\u0026nbspwill be able to access the actual world wide web, although the government does block access to US-funded websites which broadcast anti-communist news from Florida and a few other sites which call for change in Cuba.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

However, if is passed it would underscore the difference between many members of the US foreign policy establishment and Donald Trump.\u0026nbspIt would\u0026nbspalso force Mr Trump to decide whether or not to veto the measure.Sean Penn filming documentary on murdered journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Trump has repeatedly sought to defend the crown prince, denying reports that the CIA had concluded he was behind October’s killing of the 59-year-old journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\u0026nbspLast month, the president issued a statement saying the US would remain a steadfast ally of Saudi Arabia, even though the prince “may or may not” have been behind the killing that triggered global outrage.\u0026nbsp“I’m not going to tell a country....that has helped me keep oil prices down...I’m not going to destroy our economy by being foolish with Saudi Arabia,” Mr Trump.Jamal Khashoggi murderAfter emerging from a private briefing with CIA Director Gina Haspel, Mr Graham of South Carolina, said\u0026nbspa person would have to be “willfully blind not to come to the conclusion this was orchestrated and organised by people under the command of Mohammed bin Salman”.The Hill said the Senate is bracing for a chaotic floor fight over the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen and Mr Khashoggi’s murder.Senators voted to kick a resolution to the full Senate last week that would require Mr Trump to withdraw troops in or “affecting” Yemen within 30 days unless they are fighting Al-Qaeda.The resolution also calls on the Saudi government to negotiate with representatives of the Houthi movement and agree to a political resolution and end the country’s humanitarian crisis. The bombing campaign – supported by a number of Gulf nations as well as the US and UK – has resulted in a massive humanitarian catastrophe.Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the foreign relations committee, and who supports ending US support for Saudi Arabia’s bombing of Yemen, said his views had only solidified after attending the briefing on Capitol Hill.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The flag-draped casket of former US President George HW Bush is carried by military pallbearers past US President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, former President Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former first lady Hillary Clinton, former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter as it arrives at his state funeral at Washington National CathedralHigh school students burn a barricade in front of their high school during a demonstration against French government Education reformsSully, the service dog of former US President George HW Bush in his final months, lays in front of Bush\u0027s casket at the George H Lewis \u0026amp Sons funeral home in Houston, TexasCourtesy Office of George HW BushReutersDemonstrators march in Brussels to \u0027claim the climate\u0027 as world leaders meet in Poland to discuss the Paris climate agreement targetsA protester moves to lob a tear gas canister during a protest in Paris today against rising fuel pricesUS President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

Inside, dim lamps lead the way down a narrow passageway into a warren of small rooms where the air is cool and damp. There is a kitchen, a bedroom with mattresses laid out, a prayer room and a command centre where orders are barked through a crackling radio.This is what the inside of a Hezbollah tunnel looks like. The Israeli army – the militant group’s greatest foe – launched an operation this week to destroy tunnels much like this one, which it had discovered running underneath the border and into Israel.But this tunnel in Mleeta, southern Lebanon, remained undiscovered in the nine years it was used by Hezbollah fighters to launch attacks against occupying Israeli troops. Today, it is part of a sprawling interactive museum complex that glorifies that fight.“Israel didn’t know about this tunnel until we opened it up to the public in 2010,” says Ahmed Mansour, a spokesman for the museum. “It was kept hidden for all that time.”At a time when Hezbollah’s subterranean activities are under renewed scrutiny, the museum at Mleeta serves as a reminder of the crucial role that tunnel warfare has played in the group’s past, and will likely play in its future.Work began on the tunnel here at Mleeta in 1989, seven years into Israel’s 1982-2000 occupation of Lebanon. It took 1,000 men more than three years to dig, and when completed it became an important outpost for the group, allowing fighters to move undetected by drones and jets.“There was a big difference in strength between the two sides,” says a guide at Mleeta who did not want to give his name. “The tunnels were simple but very effective.”TarlingThe Independent)When Israel eventually withdrew from Lebanon, Hezbollah quickly began preparing for the next battle. The Iran-backed group built hundreds more complexes like this across the south.“Between 2000 and 2006, Hezbollah constructed a very elaborate and comprehensive underground infrastructure in the south Lebanon border district, consisting of bunkers and tunnel networks,” says Nicholas Blanford, author of Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah’s Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.Israeli army launches operation to uncover Hezbollah tunnelsThose tunnels were used to great effect in the devastating 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel, in which more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians and 44 Israelis were killed, according to Blanford. The conflict ended in a stalemate, which Hezbollah touted as a victory.“They were able to launch rockets from underground facilities close to the border with Israel and to ambush Israeli troops that penetrated Lebanese territory,” he says.That tunnel network could be utilised to even more deadly effect in the event of another war, a point that has become more relevant in recent months.TarlingThe Independent)Over the past few years, Hezbollah and Israel have taken their rivalry to the battlegrounds of the Syrian civil war. But as that conflict is winding down, Lebanon is again becoming a focus for them both.Israel has watched with concern as Hezbollah has emerged from the Syrian conflict significantly stronger. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, claims to have built up an arsenal of longer-range and more accurate missiles.The cross-border tunnels add another dimension to Hezbollah’s threat. If utilised, the group would be able to send fighters to attack Israeli towns and villages.The Israeli army began digging on its side of the border on Tuesday, and announced later in the day that it had destroyed one tunnel that began in a home near the border village of Kfar Kala and stretched some 40 metres into Israel. \u0026nbspThe discovery has raised tensions along the border, which has been relatively quiet since 2006. Speaking on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the tunnels “an unacceptable act of wanton aggression”.“These cross-border terror tunnels were built by Hezbollah with a direct support and funding from Iran. They were built with one purpose in mind: to attack and murder innocent Israeli men, women, and children,” he said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The flag-draped casket of former US President George HW Bush is carried by military pallbearers past US President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, former President Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former first lady Hillary Clinton, former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter as it arrives at his state funeral at Washington National CathedralHigh school students burn a barricade in front of their high school during a demonstration against French government Education reformsSully, the service dog of former US President George HW Bush in his final months, lays in front of Bush\u0027s casket at the George H Lewis \u0026amp Sons funeral home in Houston, TexasCourtesy Office of George HW BushReutersDemonstrators march in Brussels to \u0027claim the climate\u0027 as world leaders meet in Poland to discuss the Paris climate agreement targetsA protester moves to lob a tear gas canister during a protest in Paris today against rising fuel pricesUS President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

The Israeli military launched an operation on Tuesday to ‘expose and thwart’ tunnels it says were built by the Hezbollah militant group that stretch from Lebanon into northern Israel\u0026nbsp(AP)But Netanyahu has found a sympathetic ear in Washington, with the administration of President Donald Trump. In October, Mr Trump signed new sanctions against Hezbollah, promising to “target, disrupt, and dismantle their operational and financing networks”.He said of the group, which was behind a 1983 bombing of a US barracks in Beirut that killed 241 Marines, “No terrorist group other than al-Qaeda has more American blood on its hands.”At a time when the group is already under financial strain for its involvement in the Syrian civil war, those sanctions may do more damage than the destruction of a few tunnels.“The exposure of the tunnels for Hezbollah is not the end of the world,” says Blanford. “It’s quite possible they will have tunnels that the Israelis won’t know about, and won’t be able to detect.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004530656212.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says goodbye george bush","story":"Alongside Western allies, none more important than the British, he helped to steer the world through the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the birth of young democracies across Eastern Europe.And he led an international coalition to victory in the first Gulf War, after Margaret Thatcher told him it was “no time to go wobbly” and that their shared values were worth fighting for.He was part of a group of world leaders who had the courage of their convictions and a belief in freedom and liberty, both economic and social.The tributes paid to the President from those who worked with him in new, emerging nations show how important that faith was.Politicians today could learn from his steadfast commitment.History will remember him fondly. WE couldn’t agree more with Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman.Our schools cannot become surrogate parents.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Christmas Day I will be enduringour annual family fallout over a game of Monopoly. ButI wasn’t, I’d be straight round to Middleton Towers in Bucklebury, Berks, for what sounds like an idyllically festive few days.In a Christmas walnutshell, it goes something like this: Wake up whenever, pop in to the local church, go for a walk, open a few pressies, smoked salmon and champagne for lunch, more pressies, some games, then the main meal early evening.Oh, and all the grandchildren will have a small tree in their bedrooms that they can decorate themselves. The rest of the year, she says, “is really normal most of the time”. Which, to Prince William, who has grown up amid the pomp and circumstance of stuffy royal traditions, must feel like a slice of sheer heaven.Instead, poor love, he and Kate are expected to join the rest of the royalsat Sandringham, where the Queen et al stick to the German tradition of opening gts on Christmas Eve before dressing for a “formal dinner” from which, oh dear, the women eventually retire to another room while the men enjoy a port or brandy.Then it’s off to the highly publicised visit to St Mary’s Magdalene church on Christmas morning, followed by a turkey lunch and a communal viewing of “Granny’s” speech at pm.It’s unclear when William and Kate will head off to see her family, but what’s the betting they get in the car with fixed grins before mumbling “thank God that’s over for another year” the second they hit Norfolk’s A  And that’s why, whatever the truth behind the rumours that Kate and Meghan aren’t getting on, it won’t matter one jot to the admirably grounded Duchess of Cambridge who, thanks to her idyllic childhood, knows exactly who she is.Meghan, on the other hand, has no such cosy alternative to retreat to. Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable. But just like Kate did, it’s far better to quietly earn respect not noisily demand it.SUN writer Lynsey Clarke had the, er, pleasure of reporting on the opening night of Magic Mike Live at London’s Hippodrome casino.Thankfully, I was washing my hair that evening.For the show involves, horror of horrors, “audience participation”.  Not me, no sir-ee.Years ago, a friend booked a surprise stripper to turn up midway through my birthday dinner at a restaurant.But I clocked him the second he walked in, legged it out through the kitchens and refused tountil he’d safely vacated the premises.SHORTLY after Brit John Drennan proposed to Daniella Anthony during their trip to New York, the ring fell off her finger and into a drain.Their effort to retrieve the sparklerwas picked up on CCTV and went viral.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.To apply for the new flagship benefits system you do need a form of ID - this can be a passport, credit card or a driving licence.ButBrits dont have this, there are other forms of ID that can be used - including evidence of your address, bills, a birth or marriage certicate, a National Insurance card, or council tax documents.Claimants can also be asked security questions too to try and very identities.Today it was revealed that the DWP has spent £million on adverts for Universal Credit.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: Having ID is not a requirement for those making a Universal Credit claim but it does make the process easier.

I want my kids to make informed decisions – not a default decision and know what’s on offer.”He added: “We’ve been technical education snobs. We’ve revered the academic but treated vocational as second class - when we do it well, law, engineering, medicine - then we don’t even call it vocational.

Suddenly, every berk thinks that the phone in their hand gives them the right to publish anything they see.Either they have some gung-ho fantasy of being a war correspondent, responsible for recording a fracas without doing a damn thing about stopping it. Or  in their head they are suddenly Quentin ­Tarantino, recording a particularly tasty bit of violence.So we get incidents like last week’s, at a Towie-favourite nightclub in Gants Hill, North East ­London. A young woman was filmed being sexually assaulted as onlookers, some of them women, jeer at the “fun” and point cameras up her skirt.Were these people scared of intervening and pulling the thugs off her, and filming it in order to pass the footage on to club management and police  Nope, they just put it up on the internet for the world to share the jeering. The weird and wicked idea that this is somehow OK is growing.Incidents on planes, in clubs, in the street, in schoolyards, are filmed by bystanders who don’t even try to shout or intervene. They are then plonked online, just to get some strange kudos for the person filming it.From the US and, increasingly, here there are cases of onlookers recording the humiliation of other people, not responsibly and ethically in order to give it to the authorities — managements, police, teachers — but just to put it online and “go viral”.Take the coward who last month filmed a policewoman being violently kicked in the head, then posted the footage online with the caption “LOL.” Or the bully who posted a video of a drunk teen ­giving oral sex to more than  men in Magaluf, for the “banter”.And last week, a shocking video of a -year-old Syrian refugee boy called Jamal being dragged to the floor by his neck went viral. Then, because the poor boy has not been humiliated enough, his ordeal was shared online by “disgusted” celebs and MPs who proclaim to care but are, of course, unwittingly ­contributing to his suffering.Some may vaguely think they are activists exposing bad ­behaviour, but in cases like this they are no such thing. They are voyeurs, cowards, and exhibitionists. Because it’s the victim of the attack, not just the attackers, who gets humiliated.Anyone half-decent understands that only disgusting ­people go in for “revenge porn”, sharing intimate videos of someone they broke up with. Whether dumped or cheated on, that is a horrible thing to do and can make the victim suicidal. Young girls live in terror of it, on one hand encouraged to be sexy and on the other scared of having their most unguarded moments exposed to the world.It has, a few times, led to ­prosecution and so it should. But personal vengeance and associated “slut-shaming” is only part of it.The whole business of filming other people without consent needs to be seen for what it is — a form of unregulated, potentially irresponsible and damaging rogue journalism.  Smartphone tech and the internet should be ­governed by the same ethical rules journalism developed.Good editors pixelate faces and agonise about what is responsible reporting, and what is in the ­public interest.If it would be wrong for a news reporter to film, for no good ­reason, a person being humiliated, assaulted, or even just tumbling in the street or falling asleep in an embarrassing position on a train, then it is even more wrong for any selfish git with a smartphone to do it.Journalism has rules because it is public. Now that technology can make anyone’s instant shot just as public, the rules should be the same. And because the technology belongs to the “digital natives” who grew up with it, it is time they applied to it all those pious, ethical modern values which we hear so much about.Not all slut-shamers and gloating video bystanders are young — but a great many are.

All the while these politicians are trying to scupper Brexit, they are putting on their sincere faces and saying: “We must respect the will of the people.”This is a downright lie and it has always been a downright lie.When Tory Remainers tell you we must get a good deal, they really mean we must not leave the European Union.When the Labour Party tells you that we must have a “good Brexit for jobs”, they really mean that we must not leave the European Union.When that coffin-faced bore Dominic Grieve, once our Attorney General, puts down amendments which effectively stop us leaving with a no-deal, he is really saying: “We must not leave the European Union under any conditions at all.”When they start lecturing you about how Parliament must be sovereign — they’re saying the same thing. We must not leave the EU.What has happened over the past two years has been a concerted campaign of treachery and betrayal.The Tory Brexiteers — with one or two exceptions, such as David Davis, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg — haven’t helped by being a disorganised rabble.Too interested in their own political careers to do the dficult work of leading Britain towards a confident exit from that authoritarian bureaucracy.But it is the Remainers who have done the real damage.If they didn’t tell us, at every step of the way, that “the people’s vote must be respected” then I’d have a little more time for them.

Then threw a bucket of water at him.Then said: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your head in.”After which, this entitled madam actually rang  – twice – to say the reporter was “stalking” her.Unbelievable.Then there’s  Grandma Osamor, Kate’s mother Martha. Now ennobled as Baroness Osamor of Tottenham and taking her seat in the House of Lords at your expense.A supporter of Labour activists suspended over anti-Semitism.And once considered too left-wing even for the Labour Party, until Corbyn came along.What a great parenting job both she and her daughter have done.And do you suppose that either would be in the ­positions they are now were it not for the colour of their skin THE animal rights activists Peta want us to stop using  certain phrases which are nasty about animals.Such as, “No use flogging a dead horse”.Better to say: “You can’t feed a fed horse.” Which doesn’t sound right at all, to me.Some vegans are also supposedly  objecting to “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because it’s unkind to eggs. And “bringing home the bacon”. Which is unkind to bacon.I think we need to create a few new ones to annoy Peta even further. So . . .Too many voles in the blender spoil the smoothie.Riots, confusion, mayhem. They’ve just woken up to the fact that their president is a smirking liberal halfwit who cares not a jot about working-class people.  We could have told you that, mes amis, when you elected him  months ago.Emmanuel Macron has already had to climb down and give in to some of the demands from the rioters.During the election he portrayed himself as a populist, but was anything but. It was a con job.Next time you toddle off to the polls, you lot, get it right.SO, Nigel Farage has deserted Ukip because he thinks the party has become too extremist.Fair enough, he’s probably right. The party looks dead and buried.It’s a shame that because of our first-past-the-post system Ukip were never able to capture many seats in parliament.I’ve never been a fan of proportional representation.Butwe had it, Ukip under Farage, above, would likely be our second or third biggest party by now.And those negotiations over  Brexit would be looking very dferent, wouldn’t they RESPECT to Wrexham driver Kenneth Samuels. He managed to fit ELEVEN people into his Ford Focus.Actually, he’s a Wrexham non-driver now, because the Old Bill caught him.  He was disqualied from driving for  months.I assumed at first that he was ferrying a troupe of dwarves to a panto.But no. There were children involved, which kind of antagonised the magistrates.If the police had looked a bit further I suspect they’d have found the entire Liberal Democrat Party in the boot.  And Speaker John Bercow in the glove box. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UK Parliament is doing its job properly for the first time in almost a decadeThis is how democracy is supposed to work, peopleShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsopinion\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen politicians are unsure, they ask the people to decide. When the people cant, they tell politicians to figure it out. The courts pick their way through the detail trying to be fair to all sides, and only the journalists try to explain why its complicated. So it is with capital punishment, terrorism, drone strikes, tax reforms, benefit cuts and everything  in le. Most of us expect complexity, relying on others to help us find a balance that doesnt kill us. We vote for representatives, then ask them to rely on their judgement to decide everything until we demand they rely on ours. But with Brexit the whole things gone cockeyed. We voted for those who suggested our relationship with the EU was simple. Parliament voted enthusiastically for a simple referendum. The people gave a simple answer, the government issued a simple letter. The courts were the first ones to decide it was complicated and journalists have spent the past two years failing to explain much at all. Its hardly surprising were now in a world where simple people still demand a simple Brexit and that politicians rely on the people to figure it out for them. A ComRes poll shows that people oppose remaining in the EU, oppose leaving with Theresa Mays deal, oppose a second referendum and oppose leaving without a deal. Their big idea instead is to renegotiate, despite the fact weve done that for two years and all the clowns achieved was a joke buttonhole that squirts water at the EU infor poundbillion. Politicians are now so confused about whos supposed to be doing what that the Disgraced Dr Liam Fox says theres a real danger that MPs may attempt to stealBrexit from the British people, and Michael Gove said that not delivering a simple thing that isnt possible because its more complicated than that would be a fatal blow to faith in democracy. Andrea Leadsom smilingly added that Parliamentarians who want to be in government in the future will live to regret the decision they took last night, as though she were a Mafia consigliere threatening painful retribution against those who disrespected the Prime Minister. Lets just stop there. Lets go back a bit, and explain. In  there was a massive, global, banking crash. Had it been ignored by politicians everyone would be living out of dustbins by now. All right, Richard Branson would be in Necker and Alan Sugar on his yacht, but it would be dustbins for them too.   Politicians worldwide did their jobs and figured out a solution. Two years later there was a general election and the people couldnt pick a team, so politicians had to form their own. Bizarrely, the party that came second wasnt part of it. The not-quite winners teamed up with the actual-losers and took power with barely a flicker of democratic concern.In the years that followed they housed immigrants in areas that rarely voted for their parties. Despite the fact such people produced more tax than they spent, they cut services in those places more than in friendlier ones. The aim, and result, was that Labour-voting areas became more xenophobic and more likely to turn Tory on immigration issues. They declared the previous administration profligate, then accumulated so many debts theyve started selling them off. They promised a northern powerhouse, while investing poundbn in the south and cutting investment by poundbn in the north.Thats not normal behaviour for politicians of any stripe, as theyre usually fully aware they can be sacked at short notice. But THIS lot established fixed, five-year contracts, which meant democracy was limited.When we were finally allowed a vote, the people picked the team which had been doing all the above but pretending that it wasnt. That team then opted to protect itself - not the country - by offering a referendum on leaving the EU which it thought no-one would want to do. But the people, now thoroughly confused by lies, theft, quantitative easing, Question Time, austerity, bananas and everything  hurled at them for years, picked the easy road - the f*** it road. The team captains ran away, the pound noseed, and those left on the field started barking the chaos was all Project Fear and could be completely ignored.   A new team captain activated Article  and told Parliament it had no say. The courts intervened to say Parliament was sovereign. Newspapers said judges were the enemy. Parliament was cowed into backing Article , even though it was vague and fully-revokable.The government then spent two years not negotiating a deal that isnt actually a deal, before telling the people and Parliament its the only option when it isnt. Few people notice that were preparing to leave the EU with , more people in poverty than we had  years ago, or have asked whether Brexit is in their interests.When the four estates of a democratic nation are in such turmoil and acting in direct opposition to their normal roles, there is nothing to do but hold on and hope for the best. And now, the ship of state is righting itself. Journalists are explaining complexities and detail. Judges are regarded as refuge. And Parliament has, finally, begun holding government to account.   For the first time in history, those ruling the country have been proven to be in contempt of our democratic processes. For the first time since the Brexit vote, the government has been forced to bow to the will of those figuring things out on behalf of the people. And for the first time in  years the Mother of Parliaments is acting like a grown-up - something that happens when loyal MPs rebel for a principle, when politicians seek to listen to one anothers arguments, when the people take an interest in what is being decided on their behalf. Nothing is perfect. We live in a world where racists claim the same freedom of expression as journalists, and believe that makes it all right to hurl homophobic slurs at a columnist while chasing him down the street, to threaten Jewish MPs online, to cause BBC reporters to need bodyguards. In the past decade, the confusion in our system has been fed by fake news, populism and idiots. The reason that these things - more properly called propaganda, fascism and the unelectable - do not dominate our world is because the system self-corrects. Each part pushes and pulls against the others, and the result is stable, slow, progress.  That is what happened in Parliament yesterday. Its what, hopefully, will continue this week while they vote on Brexit. Remember ityou are asked to vote again. Remember it when a journalist tries to explain, when judges rule, when MPs rebel and amend and argue. Elsewhere, with Parliaments that do not scrutinise the government, dictators hold power. Where journalists cannot explain, the people are kept in ignorance. And where those things are actively attacked, the world grows dark -  journalists were murdered this year while  languish in jail, most of them for crimes against the state. While Putin and Bin Salman high-five after the dismemberment of a journalist, remember that reporters are the first bit of democracy that dies. In their wake come the opponents, the judges, and then the people. However confusing and chaotic your democracy is, hold on to it. Be glad you have an MP, especiallythey dont always do as theyre told. Seek out a journalist whos explained well and say thank you, because the occasional pat is the only encouragement they need to keep headbutting walls. Note what happens when people dont vote, and make sure you do. Above all, be glad you have an opportunity to argue about your nations direction, and that youre not the only one steering the ship.

With just five days to go until the crunch vote on her Brexit deal, the Prime Minister held private talks with sceptical Brexiteers to try and avert a crushing defeat. It came as the Government was forced to publish legal advice it tried to keep confidential, which confirmed the UK would be unable to quit the backstop without the EU’s permission. The backstop keeps Northern Ireland in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the -mile frontier with EU member Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May’s fragile government, launched a furious attack on the “devastating” advice. Nigel Dodds, the Northern Irish party’s shyWestminster leader, said: “The union of the United Kingdom is non-negotiable”. Read the full Brexit legal advice document   In a sign of how poor relations are between the two parties, the DUP suggested their  MPs would be willing to back Mrs May in a no-confidence vote onlyMPs first voted down her Brexit deal. Yet Downing Street claimed the Tory-DUP deal was still in place and that Northern Ireland would get the full poundbillion they had been promised. And whips are still concerned her premiership could come crashing downTory Brexiteer MPs support Labour in a confidence vote. Mrs May wants to broker a compromise plan to get rebellious MPs to back her which could include giving them a parliamentary “lock” on the backstop. It would mean the Government’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border with Irelanda trade deal is not struck would only come into forceMPs approved it. A No source said: “She understands people still have concerns and will be talking to colleagues.” Chief whip Julian Smith was despatched to a meeting of the hardline ERG group of Brexiteers to try to win them over. But with more than  Conservatives now stating that they are going to oppose the Government, the scale of the challenge looked insurmountable. MPs dismissed her “lock” proposals as a fig leaf. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said: “It’s a silly idea few will fall for”. Brussels appeared to be preparing for Mrs May’s deal being voted down by putting Article , which triggered Brexit, on the agenda of next week’s EU summit.   It raised speculation that leaders might delay the UK’s departure date to July, in order to give Mrs May more time. The six-page legal advice by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC said the UK could become mired for years in negotiations with Brussels with no power to leave. The EU could apply to an shyarbitration  for Northern Ireland to remain in the EU customs area after Great Britain left, Mr Cox advised. Despite assurances the backstop,used, would be temporary, the situation would “endure indefinitely” until a trade agreement was reached. Mr Cox admitted it “does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit the UK-wide customs union without a subsequent agreement”. He warned the risk was “a political decision for the Government”. Mrs May insisted both she and Mr Cox had openly said the backstop was shyindefinite without a final trade deal. Mr Dodds said his party’s opposition to the deal had been vindicated.   “The legal advice just published proves Northern Ireland would be in full shyEuropean Union Customs Union while Great Britain is not,” he said. “This backstop is totally unacceptable to unionists and it must be defeated and arrangements renegotiated that uphold the commitments which the Prime Minister and her Government made.” Blasting the attempt to keep the advice secret, Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “All that this advice reveals is the central weaknesses in the Government’s deal. It is unthinkable it tried to keep this information from Parliament and the public before next week’s vote.” Meanwhile, Labour MPs were surprised that Jeremy Corbyn opted not to attack Mrs May on Brexit at Prime Minister’s Questions following one of the most turbulent days of her premiership. And Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey, one of the Labour leader’s closest allies, dealt a blow to second referendum campaigners by suggesting voters would see it as a betrayal.The UK faces a new year recession as Brexit fears crush business and consumer confidence, economists predict. Chris Williamson, of IHS Markit, said: “The possibility of no deal has caused companies and customers to cancel spending.”"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa loses brexit vote what","story":"NewsIf Theresa May loses the Brexit vote this is what could happen nextThe Prime Minister appears doomed to certain defeat, unable to cobble together the numbers to force her blueprint through the CommonsShareCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politicsBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  DEC NewsTheresa May faces the fight of her political le \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf  MPs back Theresa May’s Brexit deal she will emerge victorious on Tuesday. The Tories have  MPs, plus she has a confidence and supply deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, so all will be well for the Prime Minister, yes  Emphatically, no. In fact, she appears doomed to certain defeat, unable to cobble together the numbers to force her blueprint through the Commons. Thanks to Mrs May needlessly squandering David Cameron’s hard-won,fragile, majority at last year’s snap general election - the one she never needed to call - she has to rely on the DUP to win parliamentary votes. But despite the poundbillion bung she conjured up for the Ulster hardliners, the DUP will not support the pact because elements of the deal would make Northern Ireland dferent from the rest of the UK. That strips away the PM’s stitched-together majority in a trice. In her own party, insiders believe up to nine Tory Remainers could vote against the deal, piling further pressure on the premier.   And then there is the European Research Group, a seemingly innocent name for the Conservatives’ hardline Brexiteers. Scores of its members are set to revolt unless Mrs May conjures a compromise. Sources estimate up to  Tory MPs could vote against the deal. While some Labour MPs may rebel against Jeremy Corbyn and offer their support, it is highly unlikely to be anywhere near enough to save the PM’s pact. What happened in the Commons yesterday  Theresa May lost three crucial votes. MPs backed a Labour amendment which held the Government in contempt for refusing to publish its full legal advice on the Brexit plan. The advice will now be released, and could confirm the worst fears of the Brexiteers – making even more of them likely to vote down the deal. Then MPs backed an amendment by Tory MP Dominic Grieve which would give MPs a say on what happensTheresa May’s Brexit deal is voted down. This means they could block a no-deal Brexit, send the Prime Minister back to the negotiating table or even call for a second referendum. The PM is no longer in control of Parliament or the Brexit process.   Can Brexit be halted  Remainers have seized on the provisional findings of the The European Court of Justice’s advocate general, who said the UK can decide on its own to cancel its withdrawal from the EU. It is not a binding judgment but suggests the ECJ will come to the same conclusion in its official ruling. This would allow us to revoke Article , the two-year mechanism Mrs May triggered which started the countdown to our departure on March , . What happens next  The key moment is on Tuesday when MPs vote on Mrs May’s Brexit plan. Unless she persuades Tory rebels to change their mind she is heading for almost certain defeat. More than  Conservative MPs, the DUP, the vast majority of Labour MPs,  Lib Dems and the SNP have all said they will vote down the proposal. But some Brexiteers may take fright at Mr Grieve’s amendment, fearing it could scupper Brexit. What does the Prime Minister doshe loses  We are in uncharted territory. The law says Mrs May has toto Parliament within  days with an updated response. Much will depend on the scale of defeat. If it is close she could try to wring further concessions from Brussels. If she is heavily defeated she will be under intense pressure to resign.   Where does that leave Brexit  Nobody knows. MPs could send the PM back to Brussels but that would need the EU to agree to extend Article . Or Mrs May could call a snap election. This is a high-risk move for the Tories as it could land Jeremy Corbyn in No . MPs could also decide only a second referendum can break the deadlock. The default is that we crash out without a deal. But most MPs will do everything they can to prevent what they see as an economic calamity.

Rachel Melbourne, , and her partner Lee Grantham, , have been forced to sleep rough after being evicted from their house in Hull. The pair claim they were stripped of their belongings and left with just the clothes on their backs after ing to the house in June to find it boarded up with their two dogs still inside. With nowhere to turn they have been camping out in a tent in a friend’s back garden, reports Hull Live.   Miss Melbourne said: “It’s unbearable and it’s got to the point now where we have nowhere to turn and nothing to lose. No one seems to be interested in wanting to help us. “It’s freezing and we wake up every morning with ice all over the tent.We’ve been getting really poorly and really chesty because of the damp – especially Lee who is awake all night coughing. “We can’t go to the toilet, we can’t get a bath or a shower and we’ve only got the clothes we were left with.We’ve got two airbeds which keep deflating and a quilt but we still wake up with wet inside the tent.” The couple had lived in their home since January  and the day after their eviction, Miss Melbourne says her boyfriend was attacked outside the house in relation to the dispute.  On July , the pair suffered further heartbreak after being forced to put down their fox terrier Lucy with vets believing the animal could have suffered after being “struck in the stomach.” They have contacted Hull City Council and were placed on the housing list four months ago but they are still yet to find a home with Christmas just weeks away.

She is urging people to find it in their hearts to give them any spare change they have so they can escape the “nightmare” they are currently enduring. She said: “Words can’t explain how much it would mean to us to have a home. We need a base to get our lives back because we’ve lost everything and we are drained. “We have both thought ‘what is the point of being here ’ because no one seems to care. “If anyone has got a heart I would urge them to help because we would not put our worst enemies in this situation.

Chris Sharp, , and his family were on a walk in New Brighton, Merseyside when they decided to visit the fast-food restaurant which recently opened. Looking to get shelter from the cold weather, and noticing several empty tables, they approached the eatery. However the father-of-five claims that staff told them it was too busy to come in and would not even let them wait in the doorway - despite the family seeing plenty of empty tables inside. Chris said: I was amazed, and askedthey were actually being serious. The kids just wanted a burger - they were freezing. I said cant we just wait in the door  All we were met with was a point blank no, and the door shut.  I couldnt believe the attitude - no explanation or anything. I think its ridiculous the way we were treated. A disgrace. Chris, who was with three of his young children and we Ashleigh at the time, said the family ended up going to Subway instead. Describing the situation, which is said to have happened on Sunday, he said: We went for a walk along New Brighton promenade because the weather was looking alright. We got to Fort Perch Rock and it started to get chilly.The kids were moaning that they were hungry so we decided to go to Burger King.

Chris continued: I said whats the problem  Weve got an eight month old in the pram and a three-year-old I was carrying. By the time we have sat down and taken our coats off itd be about  minutes anyway, but they said no, youre not coming in. So we were left outside in the cold. Shocking.  We looked into the restaurant and there was no one at the till and only about eight or nine people sitting down eating. I was fuming to be honest. The kids were crying. Chris said it was doubly disappointing because there has been so much hype about the new restaurant opening recently. When askedthere was any chance he wouldto the store in future, he said: No chance. The way we were spoken to was disgusting. I couldnt believe it. It comes after the world-famous chain said it would open its new store with a brand new prime design, having received planning permission.

It all started after the birth of my youngest son Josh and got worse from there. “I had the treatment after listening to Danielle Lloyd talking about having vaginal tightening, as her incontinence issues sounded just like mine.   “I’d be in the office, having a laugh and a bit of wee would come out. Not only was it embarrassing, but it wasn’t very hygienic either. Before taking the plunge, Abby researched the treatment, discovering that the procedure involved using a pixel Co laser, to improve blood flow, increase lubrication and restore the strength and elasticity of the vaginal wall. Confident it was the right solution for her, she contacted Courthouse Clinics, the company where she already went for Botox, having the first of three sessions in London on June  this year - noticing a dference straight away. Abby, also mum to Daniel, , from a previous relationship, explained: “You have to position yourself at the edge of the couch and spread your legs for the laser to be inserted, a bit like having a smear test, only warmer.   “My doctor explained that I wouldn’t feel results immediately, but I actually did, I didn’t feel the pressure to go to the loo as often and when I did run up and down the beach on my holiday straight after, the effects weren’t nearly as bad. It doesnt make it look any dferent, but it is more about the inside and improving the , which it has done. Having another session at the London clinic before her third treatment in October, Abby also discovered it had another unexpected benefit, when she and her husband made love. She continued: “It’s given me a real confidence boost and makes me feel so much younger, knocking  years off how I feel in the bedroom. “I couldn’t recommend it enough.” "},{"url":null,"title":"possessive boyfriend used sleeping lovers","story":"NewsPossessive boyfriend used sleeping lovers thumb to unlock her phone and spyAlexander Heavens admitted engaging in controlling and coercive behaviourShareCommentsByStephen WhiteAmy Walker:,  DEC NewsAlexander Heavens would wake his girlfriend to interrogate her about any names he found on her phoneLtd\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA possessive boyfriend who used his sleeping girlfriend’s thumb to unlock her iPhone and checkshe was dating other men now has a criminal record.

Researchers announced they have carried out , “whole genomic sequencing” on volunteers which can diagnose the lelong risk of cancers. Genetic data from five million Brits will help decide how best to treat tumours and predict how they will react to surgery or chemotherapy. The test, which currently cost around pound per person, also means people at risk of a certain cancer can alter their diet or take pills so they never develop it. Scientists say the gene sequencing could become “routine” and one day replace the current heel prick test at birth. It could lead to genes from every child being sampled in a bid to invent a cancer cure.   The Government says the NHS is the world’s first healthcare system to role out sequencing the human genome on such a scale. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “Sequencing the ,th genome is a major milestone in the route to the healthcare of the future. “Britain has led the world in this amazing technology and we do so again today as we map a course to sequencing a million genomes.Understanding the human code on such a scale is part of our mission to provide truly personalised care to help patients live longer, healthier and happier lives. The DNA sequencing of five million Brits will be taken in the next five years including the comprehensive whole genomic test on one million of the volunteers. Many tumours will not spread but it is dficult to know which are harmless and which will become deadly.Biopsies, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can sometimes do more harm than good.  Anonymised DNA data from the patients along with their medical history will allow computers to predict how a tumour will react to ious treatments. Sir John Chisholm, chair of Genomics England which leads the project, said: “The results of this will be felt for many generations to come as the benefits of genomic medicine in the UK unfold. “It should become routine at some point in the future that your health record will contain some form of genomic test,” he added. DNA tests are already carried out on the NHS for a specic genetic mutation or risk. Whole genomic sequencing tests are dferent as they look for mutations linked to  dferent cancers and , other diseases. Since the , Genomes Project was launched in  around , of the , volunteers had rare unexplained diseases diagnosed for the first time.A further , were diagnosed with cancers and given more effective treatment. Professor Mark Caulfield, chief scientist at Genomics England, said genomic sequencing could replace the current heel prick test which tests for devastating neurological conditions. “Currently they do the heel prick test to look for nine dferent conditions,” he told a briefing in central London yesterday. “There may be potential in the future to look at much more and thereby avoid early le harm. “There are some conditions thatyou know about them could change the trajectory of the le of the child. There might be potential in the future to look more at avoiding whole le harm. “We might not feed [the information] to them in childhood but there are some conditions thatyou knew about them at birth could change the le of the child.   “There are examples where we can put children on a special diet or be given a treatment.” Health bosses said in future patients DNA data could be used with wearable biometric devices to flag up the risk of disease before it develops. They also admitted their had been attempts by hackers to access the DNA database. Foreign hackers were behind the unsuccessful attempts to get hold of the genomic data could be lucrative for firms to develop new treatments. Sir John said: “For sure these attempts have come from overseas.” Security measures adopted to protect patient information included employing a company to mount a simulated firewall assault. Since  when the first human genome was sequenced the cost of the process has plummeted from pound billion to just pound.   As the cost falls further whole genome sequencing will become more commonplace and wide-ranging, said the project leaders. A complete genome includes all of a person’s genes plus the DNA that does not directly code for proteins but may influence gene activity. Hidden within the genome may be altered elements of DNA that can trigger or worsen disease, or cause adverse reactions to medicines. Since  when the project was launched automated systems have been sequencing patient genomes at a rate of  a day. The initial target of , genomes has now been met with , sequences officially recorded. The number exceeds that of the , patients who contributed their DNA because every participant with cancer has three genomes sequenced.

Molly Phillips, , went to hospital for a suspected stroke but later realised she been strangled by the bars chef at their annual bash. Miss Phillips said she passed out after chef Nathan Webb gripped her neck at the Cameo Clubs festive party, which was held at the bar in Roath, Cardf on New Years Day. Footage from CCTV shown at an employment tribunal hearing captured the moment Mr Webb put his arm around her neck and strangled her, reports Wales Online.  The video, which Judge Alison Frazer refers to in her judgement, shows Mollys arms go rigid as the chef holds her neck and when he releases her, she collapses to the floor hitting her head. The employment tribunal ruled Ms Phillips was unfairly dismissed when bosses failed to properly investigate her complaint that she was strangled at the party. Molly told the tribunal she had since learned that her facial paralysis is more permanent than first thought and she may never be able to smile again. She said she was told her injuries were “were either caused by lack of oxygen or nerve damage”. The tribunal heard that Mr Webb was arrested over the incident but was released under investigation and remained employed by the Cameo Club after the incident.   Molly initially ed to work after the incident and told bosses she did not want to take any action. But as time went on, she became increasingly distrustful and fearful of the chef. Medics also told her that the injuries she suffered would have longer lasting effects than previously thought. Yet when she raised these concerns with the directors of the company, she was told to get over it and ultimately felt she had no choice but to quit.  In her judgement following the tribunal, judge Alison Frazer was heavily critical of the Cameos directors for failing to take her concerns seriously. She said: The fact was the CCTV evidence showed that Mr Webb had her in a hold which caused her to fall to the floor. It was only open to the Respondent to take a view as to what action was appropriate after it had impartially gathered the facts via an investigation. I find that from April onwards Mr Davies acted in a way which was dismissive of the Claimant’s feelings about the incident. He told her to ‘get over it’ when referring to the Christmas party incident. Since the incident, Molly says that as well as her partial facial paralysis, she suffers from PTSD, anxiety and depression. I can’t smile in photographs, she said.  People don’t notice it, but I notice it more than anything. If it’s still like that when I get married, I won’t be able to smile in my wedding photos. Things like that. It’s not nice. But for Molly, the worst bit was the fact her bosses didnt do anything. I’d worked there for two and half years and done everything to that place and it was just like, I realised I meant nothing to them and I was completely disposable, she said. In her evidence at the employment tribunal at Cardf Magistrates Court, Molly said she felt asthe directors didnt take her seriously. When she told director Jason Pearce, she claimed he responded by joking with Mr Webb as he walked past, telling him something along the lines of: “All right buddy  Hear you’ve been choking girls lately’. “I was never askedI was comfortable, how my medical condition was, nothing,” she said. Molly told the hearing that she found working at the establishment increasingly dficult as time went on.   She told the hearing that other alleged behaviour by Mr Webb included putting chilli in a staff member’s soup and threatening someone on a night out. After these incidents, she told her employers she had begun lose faith in their ability “to keep her safe in her workplace”. By March  she said she was “finding it hard to come into work and was crying both before and during my shts”. She told the tribunal: “Around the end of March I was in tears to Huw telling him that I just didn’t feel comfortable in work anymore but I was given the same response over and over, that he couldn’t ‘wave a magic wand and fix everything’. “Meeting after meeting I was just getting that same response and nothing more.” She also claimed she was told in one meeting on April  by Mr Davies to just “get over it, and the same comment was made again on April . In her written judgement, Judge Frazer criticised the directors for not fully investigating at this stage.   Judge Frazer wrote: She was able to carry on at work without suffering any real psychological effects, working alongside Mr Webb, until March. In March the Claimant observed two incidents that made her perceive the Christmas party incident in a dferent way. Rightly or wrongly, she formed the view from these incidents that he had the capacity to be violent towards women. This made her believe that she had been the victim of insidious violence at the hands of Mr Webb. Around this time, she also learnt that her facial paralysis was more permanent than initially anticipated. I find that this culminated in her feeling vulnerable around Mr Webb in the workplace. In my finding there was an inextricable link between the incident at the Christmas party and the workplace, even though it had happened off duty. It was a works Christmas party held on site. She also criticised the directors for their response to the CCTV footage.   She said: Mr Pearce understood from observation of the CCTV that the Claimant had been strangled. Mr Davies, on the other hand, denied that this was the case. Mr Pearce did not watch the video until April or May and Mr Davies only watched it once. And she concluded that because of their actions - and the actions of another person brought in to hear a grievance that Molly raised - Molly was justied in resigning. Judge Frazer concluded: [Molly] was constructively unfairly dismissed. Molly said she had a sense of relief when she found out she had won. It just feels like a weight lted, she added. I don’t want to think about it anymore. Cameo Club said it had no comment at all. Speaking after the hearing, a spokeswoman for South Wales Police said: A -year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and he is currently released under investigation.

Arctic sea ice has declined by % in  years and the water flowing into seas warms them, expanding their volume. This has had a major role in raising sea levels up to eight inches over  years, said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Expert Alesandro Silvano said the rise “weakens currents that trap heat and carbon dioxide, affecting global climate”. Rising heat also has an impact on our deserts, affecting their plants and animals. In some cases this is predicted to increase their size – they already cover a quarter of Earth.

Those who receive  dferent types of benefits, includingPersonal Independence Payments, Disability Living Allowance, or those on a state pension, get the pound payment.Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror   One woman, who used to receive Employment and Support Allowance [ESA] before being moved onto Universal Credit, said she was not told by the Department of Work and Pensions [DWP] that she wouldnt receive the bonus. Meryl told the i: “What really angers me is it’s a cut that hasn’t even been publicly acknowledged. Somebody’s just decided that they’re not going to pay this any more, and we’ve been given no more information. “Eventually everyone will be on Universal Credit, so it’s a sneaky way to save money.

The Trusts chief executive Emma Revie said: Christmas is supposed to be a time for joy but what were seeing is the festive period becoming increasingly stressful for more and more people across the country. Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty, but what were seeing is people struggling to heat homes and put food on the table because they simply cannot afford the basics any more and that just isnt right.

The image, posted on Instagram by a New Zealand law firm, was taken after the young grads passed the challenging bar examination. Andyou look closely at it, you can see something isnt quite right - with some of the groups hands apparently clasping at thin air. This is because the grads - all above the legal drinking age - had been holding champagne glasses when the picture was taken. However, the glasses were edited out of the image by the firm, Simpson Grierson, before it was uploaded to the social media site. The edit was made in a bid to ensure the groups achievements were the centre of attention, according to the New Zealand Herald.The firm reportedly wanted to make the post all about the graduates admission to the bar and how important it is for them. The post, which has since been removed and replaced with a dferent image, read: Congratulations to our  law graduates. This talented bunch was recently admitted to the bar — keep up the good work team. After the digital edit was spotted, human resources consultant Poncho Rivera-Pavon, who is in charge of law graduates and summer clerks for Simpson Grierson, explained why it had been made.He told Newsroom: Were very aware of the media sometimes misconstruing things and making it look like its all about the young lawyers having a drink at work.  We wanted to make it all about their admission to the bar and how important it is for them, so we decided to remove the glasses. A Simpson Grierson spokesman said the glasses were taken out so the focus would be on the graduates awesome milestone. Speaking to Stuff, the spokesman added that the firm was sorry for any unwanted attention that the graduates had since received.The new picture, which replaced the digitally altered snap, shows the group smiling widely while gathered around a sofa.Founded in , Simpson Grierson has hundreds of employees based at offices in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.It is ranked among the top legal firms in New Zealand.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that. We have Kenny Miller’s nous as well because he makes clever runs up front.”Looking towards Wednesday’s vital home clash with Hamilton, Jim will have the same squad as was on duty in the capital to pick from.“There were a few bumps and bruises but nothing serious and they should all be OK.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dee boss macca demands more of men ahead of hectic schedule","story":"As he works to turn Dundee’s season round, boss Jim McIntyre has told his players to speak up – when things go right as well as wrong.Jim himself has never been slow to let players from the technical area knowthey’ve not been pulling their weight.He also believes praise, when praise is due, must be dished out.And he wants that attitude to spill over onto the pitch during games and even in training.“We need to be demanding of each other. It can’t just come from the manager, it’s got to come from the players who are on the park,” he said.“That’s what we’ve been encouraging since we came in the door.“If somebody needs a rocket, then they get it, but encourage after that.“If they need told ‘you need to do better’, then tell them. That’s a big part of the game, but then it’s got to be equal measure of praise as well and that’s important.”It’s something Jim wants from his squad as a whole because he knows most will be called into action during a December programme that will bring seven games in just three-and-a-half weeks.A run of games that starts with Hamilton on Wednesday and ends with the pre-winter break Tayside derby against St Johnstone on December , will stretch resources but the gaffer is viewing it as a chance to pick up vital points.“It’s the same for everyone. It’s just about making sure you are recovering well between games and getting ready to go. There’s not a lot of turn around between games.“It’s an opportunity for us to maximise as many points as we can and get back into the pack.“But we’re going to need every one of the squad.“It’s a tough, tough period and there will be times when we just make changes simply because we need to freshen it, not just based on the performance.”Between now and the winter break, Jim will pay particular attention to his “over s” like Darren O’Dea, Martin Woods, Paul McGowan and Kenny Miller.At , striker Miller is comfortably the old man of the Dens Park squad.Jim, though, knows ultimately their experience will help tell them how their bodies are and whether or not they need a break from games or even training.“As a manager, I’ve always made sure that I look after the older players in the group.“I think when you are that age it’s your mentality, you know what it takes to get yourself through a game.“You know what you need to do to recover, you know how your body is.“Equally, you know when to say ‘here we go again’, it’s game time and let’s get ourselves going.”Dundee’s U s are in action this evening when they travel to take on Hearts at the Oriam .And their Youth Cup cash with Clachnacuddin takes place at Station Park on Sunday week."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/Schools-catchment-snip.jpg ","title":"dundee council blames legislation as nine of citys 43 schools at 95 capacity or above","story":"A fth of all Dundee schools are either close to capacity, full or over-capacity, new figures have revealed.A report set to be reviewed by councillors next week shows nine of Dundee’s  schools are at % capacity or above.Four of the affected schools are either at capacity or exceeding their limit, forcing head teachers to use rooms not designed for teaching or to use portable cabins. vw, px\"  The council has blamed capacity issues on legislation that gives parents the right to send their child to any school in the area.Paul Clancy, executive director of Dundee City Council’s children and family services ision, believes there is a link between schools at capacity and high demand for them from outside their catchment areas.In a report on the figures, Mr Clancy wrote: “There are seven primary schools with an occupancy level of % and above.“There is one secondary school with an occupancy level greater than %. Each of these schools has a signicant number of pupils from outside catchment.”Stewart Hunter, convener of the council’s children and family services committee, said practical reasons tend to drive most applications by parents to place their children outside their catchment area.He said: “We always encourage parents to send children to their local school but they retain the right to send their kids to anywhere in the city.“If there’s space, we have to accept them. Victoria Park, our biggest outlier with % of pupils from outwith the catchment area, is popular because it is close to the university, where a lot of parents work.“Likewise the Menzieshill schools tend to get requests because of their proximity to Ninewells Hospital.“Other reasons tend to beit’s convenient for childcare, or close to a grandparent’s house.”Both Blackness and Craigowl Primary schools are at % capacity, while SS Peter and Paul RC Primary is at % capacity.All three have more than a third of their pupils coming in from outside their catchment.Meanwhile, Fintry, Craigiebarns St Joseph’s RC and St Mary’s RC primaries are all at either % capacity or above.Of those, only St Mary’s has more than half of its pupils living inside its catchment area.Of the city’s secondary schools, Harris Academy is close to its pupil limit with % of its spaces filled.Because of the above-average demand for these schools – about a third of pupils in Dundee go to schools outside their catchment area – other schools are being under-used.Sidlaw View Primary – one of the city’s newest schools – is running at % capacity, while St Fergus RC Primary is also running at less than half its maximum.The council is confident that its newer, “future-proofed” buildings will help to ease the burden on other schools. In all, a third of the city’s primary and secondaries are at less than % of capacity.But specialist facilities are also suffering.Kingspark, the city’s only additional needs school, is at % capacity – with nowhere  to send its pupils.Mr Hunter said schools are coping “incredibly well” with the additional demand – and work was under way to alleviate pressure on schools. He said: “Staff and head teachers do an amazing job to make sure education isn’t disrupted. I really believe that it doesn’t matter which school you go to –you go to school in Dundee you will get a really good education.“There are points we need to work on at some schools and going forward we will try to address them.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5c015434ec6df.jpg ","title":"dundee people volunteer pupils join beach clean up","story":"Pupils from Dundee have given a helping hand to a local initiative to keep beaches clean after the summer is over.The Big Beach Clean got under way at Broughty Ferry Beach and volunteers came out to help, despite the damp and cold weather.Pupils from Grove Academy were not put off by the rain and got cosied up in jumpers and waterproofs to help collect litter from the sand.Pam Maclean, a biology teacher at the school, said: “We had  pupils and five staff members who took part. vw, px\"  “Pupils volunteered to come along and help with the Big Beach Clean as they felt that they had used the beach a lot this summer and wanted to help clean it up so that the community can continue to enjoy it.“Staff in the biology department have been using clips from the BBC documentary Drowning in Plastic as a teaching resource and have raised awareness of this issue with our young people.“Pupils were therefore keen to do their bit to help, found it enjoyable and wish to continue their good work in the near future.“S, S and S pupils from the school took part in the Big Beach Clean.“Staff and pupils had a great afternoon helping to clear the beach – once the rain went off.”The clean-up was part of Keep Britain Tidy."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee roads to be blocked off to accommodate new housing","story":"A number of roads in Dundee’s north-east are set to be stopped-up in order to accommodate a new housing development in the area.Roads, footpaths and parking spaces in the area of Haddington Gardens in Whitfield will be curtailed to accommodate the new homes.The plan will see a small parking area to the west of Dunbar Park blocked off, along with footpaths that line the open green space area that will soon host the development.They include links between Haddington Avenue, Harvestfield Crescent and Dunbar Park.The cost of stopping-up the roads and paths will be met by developer Merchant Homes, which is behind the plans.Merchant Homes’s proposal was submitted to Dundee City Council earlier this year and approved at committee by councillors last month.

I felt from the start we deserved it and we had a foothold in the game.“We knew it would be tough but we’re delighted with the win.“It was always going to be tough, but to a man we dominated the game.“It’s a great achievement to reach the final of the shield and the cup, but we have to go that step further.“It’s OK getting to finals, but nobody remembers teams that get beaten – it’s about winning.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

Chemo treatment is to be axed at either Ayr or Crosshouse Hospital, a health board meeting heard on Monday. Heath bosses at NHS Ayrshire  Arran are considering a huge shake-up of cancer services.  Previously it was proposed Crosshouse Hospital would be home to the cancer unit but bosses insist they are now considering Ayr too. Peter Maclean, clinical director, cancer services, said: “The next stage is to determine where the site will be.” The NHS Ayshire  Arran health board meeting was told a new model for cancer treatment is being proposed across the whole of the West of Scotland. Non-executive board member Ian Welsh said there is concern about moving services away from Ayr. As well as the main cancer unit, new outreach treatment hubs could be available where but they would only cater for low-risk cases. Nurse director Professor Hazel Borland said the outreach service could be located at Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine. She added: “For the next  to  months there will be no change. It continues as it is.” Councillor Joe Cullinane raised the issue of consultation and said any change at Ayr would become political. He added: “At the end of the day cancer touches most people’s lives in our community.” Chief executive John Burns said the ambition was to deliver the “best care we can to our population”. He added: “We need to think of it as a pathway, not just a building.” Councillor Laura Brennan-Whitefield wanted more information on the outreach cancer treatment. She said: “There has been a question mark over Ayr Hospital since . For me it is such a big thing. We have to have a sight of what the final result will be.” The chosen hospital would undergo an upgrade to host the cancer unit. A paper presented to the board said it was proposed: “NHS Ayrshire  Arran would have one cancer unit and should seek to determine optimal provision of outreach services as appropriate.” The proposed West of Scotland service model was endorsed by the board.

His mum told officers that MacKenzie used the computer everyday – to go online, for Facebook and “something to do with animals”.  Mackenzie, who has a previous conviction, appeared at court last Wednesday for sentencing. Solicitor Chris Munro said: “This is something that has spiralled, causing him to possess the images. “It’s a fairly low volume of images. “This is a matter of possession rather than distribution. “He appreciates these are particularly serious matters and custody may be on your lordship’s mind. “He resides with his mother and Mr Mackenzie is her registered carer. “She clearly would face some problemsMr Mackenzie was sent to prison today. “He has a relatively close bond with his mother.” Sherf Desmond Leslie replied: “[I have] concerns with the previous conviction and the superficial appreciation of the disposal that was made at that time.”  Mr Munro replied: “There is clearly a risk here but that can be managed in the community.” Stepping back from custody, the Sherf imposed a y community payback order. The perv was sentenced to three years supervision and as a requirement must attend the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. He was tagged for nine months where he must remain in his home address from pm - am. And he was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. MacKenzie pled guilty to being in possession of a quantity of extreme pornographic images depicting in an explicit and realistic way bestiality between adults and animals between June ,  and September , . He also admitted having in his possession indecent photos or pseudo-photos of children from June ,  and September , .

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please

the dramatic SNP walkout from Westminster earlier this year, the Scottish Secretary said Mr Blackfordrsquos latest PMQs attack on Theresa May was using language to ldquodraw attention to himself in ldquoanother stunt.Mr Mundell said: ldquoI think the Prime Minister has been very clear and very open throughout the process, and has not hidden the things within the deal that people might or might not like.ldquoShe has not hidden that this is a hard decision, itrsquos not a straightforward decision, but I also think she has been very clear about what the reality ispeople donrsquot support this deal.ldquoI donrsquot think anybody has been misled ndashthere is any attempt at misleading it is from the SNP who are somehow projecting they want some other, better alternative yet theyrsquore quite prepared to impose a no deal on Scotland.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met the leaders of all opposition Westminster parties last month in an attempt to thrash out an alternative plan that could achieve a Parliamentary majority but left London empty-handed.Mr Mundell explained hewould be backing Mrs Mayrsquos deal to avoid a no deal Brexit, because he believed there was no credible alternative availableMPs vote down the Governmentrsquos plan next Tuesday.ldquoThere are other people who believe, fancully, there is some other deal out there in the ether and they just need to vote this deal down for it to materialise in their Christmas stocking, he said. ldquoThat is not going to happen.ldquoThe deal that is one the table is the realistic option thatrsquos available.ldquoNone of the other speculated options we can say at this moment are credibly with a chance of achieving majority support in Parliament.But,following a speech to business leaders urging support for Mrs

pressure on MPs to back the Governmentrsquos deal shortly after Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom confirmed the vote is still scheduled for December  despite suggestions it could be shelved due to a lack of support.Opening the third day of debate on the deal, Mr Hammond said: ldquoI have observed this process at close quarters for two-and-a-half years and Irsquom absolutely clear about one thing, this deal is the best deal to exit the EU that is available or that is going to be available.ldquoThe idea that therersquos an option of renegotiating at the th hour is simply a delusion.ldquoWe need to be honest with ourselves, the alternatives to this deal are no deal or no Brexit.ldquoEither will leave us a fractured society and a ided nation.ldquoOnly the compromise of this negotiated deal, delivering on the referendum result by leaving the EU, ending free movement of people and reasserting our sovereign control over our laws while at the same time maintaining the closest possible trade, security and cultural links with the European Union to protect our jobs, our living standards and our values, can allow our country to move on.ldquoOnly that compromise can bring us back together

ldquoplunge the country into the uncertainty and economic self-harm of no deal and of those who want a second referendum, which he claimed would ldquofuel a narrative of betrayal.The Chancellor later told MPs that the ldquoeconomy has always been at the heart of the UKrsquos relationship with Europe and warned that a no-deal Brexit would ldquodestroy much of the -year-old trading relationship overnight.He said: ldquoFor most of us who campaigned to remain in the EU in  it was certainly not the political intuitions and the paraphernalia of the union that provided the motivation to do so but a hard-nosed appraisal of our economic interests.ldquoThe fact is our economic and trading relationship with the EU has been built over  years and during that time our economies have shaped themselves around each other and become inextricably intertwined, supply chains crisscross borders, work forces draw on talent from across the continent.He added: ldquoWhile new trade partnerships with countries outside the EU undoubtedly offer new and exciting opportunities for UK companies, the analysis the Government published last week is clear that the benefits flowing from new FTAs would not compensate for the loss of EU trade from a no-deal exit."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9105562.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ten-of-the-most-unique-scottish-food-brands","story":"For

An intergovernmental concordat, setting out the proposals, is due to be published later this week.Appearing before the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee, Mr Mundell told MPs he would welcome a move to more joint trade delegations as this would produce better value for taxpayers.It was pointed out how on some occasions UK and Scottish Government representatives had visited the same country but separately.ldquoI am very open and conducive to working together, declared Mr Mundell. ldquoThere is continued scope for closer working.

Businesses shouldnt have to choose whether they work with the UK Government or the Scottish Government. I see no impediment to that...Businesses would welcome that combined approach.\"George Hollingbery, the International Trade Minister, giving evidence alongside Mr Mundell, stressed that at present the UK Government ldquoengaged widely with the devolved administrations but suggested there would be more liaison going forward post Brexit, referring to the intergovernmental concordat, which, he explained, would ldquoincorporate the Scottish Government into the way the UK Government approached new trade deals.Askedthis meant Scottish Government ministers would be inside the negotiating room, Mr Hollingbery replied: ldquoThe offer we are making is a full and fair one and that will satisfy any reasonable observer that the devolved authorities are having a full part in the process of not only creating the outlines of our future trade agreements but also having a role further down the line.The SNPrsquos Pete Wishart, who chairs the committee, noted how people were waiting with ldquogreat excitement about what was about to be announced.However, the minister noted how one or two of the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposals to be involved in post Brexit free trade agreements were at the ldquofar end of the bargaining scale and that their suggestion of the need to get Edinburghrsquos consent was ldquonot on the table and will never be on the table.Mr Hollingbery later stressed: ldquoItrsquos not right, however close we want to bring the devolved administrations, to take their advice and for them to represent the interests of their particular areas and responsibilities, to allow them to have an effective veto at any stage.

The big question is: are we prepared for a mass uptake of EVs One new study is positive, suggesting Scotland is accelerating in the transition to EVs faster than the rest of the UK.The report by Imperial College London and ETech, commissioned by the Drax Group, shows Scotland powering ahead in terms of numbers of EV charging points being made available and the purchasing or leasing of vehicles.Motorists registered  alternative fuel vehicles in Scotland last year ndash thatrsquos a % rise on the  sold in .Meanwhile, there were , such cars sold in the rest of the UK, a rise of only % on the , in .This article was published in the December edition ofBusinessHQ -Click here to viewThe uptake in purely electric cars raced ahead, with a % rise to  registrations in Scotland compared with a % rise to , in the rest of the UK.The Drax report also highlights the fact Scotland has seen a successful sht from dependence on fossil fuels to harnessing renewable energy, meaning the creation of a full circle of zero-emission power.There is support, too, for EV buyers in the form of the Scottish Governmentrsquos intention to expand interest-free loans for EVs and hybrids.Transport Scotland, meanwhile, is inviting notfor- profit housing associations and co-operatives to apply for a share of pound, to secure the services of EV car clubs.Matthew Eastwood, Head of Transport at Energy Saving Trust, commented: ldquoPlugged-in Households enables access to electric vehicles irrespective of income or location.ldquoNot-for-profit housing associations and co-operatives in Scotland can apply for grant funding to procure the services of a zero-emission car club for use by their tenants, their own use and that of the wider local community.The latest generation of EVs, themselves, are becoming more affordable ndash and more attractive ndash as manufacturers battle to win over customers.Wersquove come a long way from actor Leonardo DiCaprio extolling the virtues of the Toyota Prius.Todayrsquos EVs are much sexier: from the Tesla Model X to the BMW i to the Jaguar I-Pace, which won Car of the Year and Best Alternative Fuel Car at the  Scottish Car of the Year awards.The electric SUV has been championed by Scottish tennis star Andy Murray, who says: ldquoJaguar is a great British brand and has changed a lot since I was young. Itrsquos making modern, younger cars, like the electric cars ndash one of the first big companies to do it ndash and the I-Pace is great to drive.ldquoWrongly, I assumed you wouldnrsquot be able to go very far with it but you can go  miles, which is obviously a long trip, so itrsquos great.ldquoI charged up once in a service station and that was fine. Obviously itrsquos a little bit longer than filling up in a petrol station, but the reason for me having to do that was that I hadnrsquot planned in advance. Now I charge the car pretty much every night when Irsquom at home.Volkswagen, whose emissions tampering scandal was a catalyst for the debate thatrsquos seen diesel cars vilied, is upping production while reducing the price of its EVs. Its new strategy could see  million models produced, with pound. billion investment set aside for battery procurement.The German marque is aiming to produce , examples of a brand new EV, known as the MEB Entry. A direct rival to the Tesla Model , itrsquos expected to retail for around pound,. It is also building , of its mid-sized ID Aero in a plant currently making the fossil-fuelled Passat.While such models are expected to be more efficient ndash helping reduce range anxiety for motorists ndash they do rely on a charging infrastructure that must be fit for purpose while seeing a huge upsurge in demand.Figures released by the RAC Foundation show Scotlandrsquos chargers were used , times during August, , compared with , times in the same month in  ndashan increase of %.Research carried out by HSBC Commercial Banking found there are  publicly funded charge points for electric vehicles in Scotland, meaning there are  people for every charger. Although this means Scotland has an above-average number of public charge points per person, itrsquos evident more can be done.Scott McClurg, head of energy and sustainability for HSBC Corporate Banking, says: ldquoIf Scotland is to sht to electric vehicles in the long term, the overall volume of charge points has to improve across the board.ldquoWhile there are clear opportunities to meet rising demand through the private sector, local authorities and central government are also looking closely at this space to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Scottish Power Energy Networks is also calling for more investment. Itrsquos already supported a range of decentralised energy measures through a Green Economy Fund.Established by the Distribution Network Operatorto support the Scottish Governmentrsquos ambitious climate change targets, pound million has been awarded to more than a dozen initiatives.These include the development of a mobile app, WattsUp, an EV route planner designed to guide drivers to their nearest charging bay.The Fund is also supporting the collection of information from network operators to offer motorists real-time data on available chargers.The Heraldrsquos newest partner in our Climate For Change campaign, Newton Property, has a range of clean and green ambitions that include fitting its nationwide property portfolio with chargers. Of course, innovation in charging capabilities ultimately will be key to making EVs a success. Shell is making great strides in new technology with the planned installation of its first ultrafast charging points in Europe.Derek MacDonald,Joint Managing Director of Newton Property ManagementIt claims they can add km of range to a carrsquos battery in just five minutes or fully recharge in  minutes ndash thatrsquos three times faster than todayrsquos best chargers.The downside is theyrsquore so powerful no car can use them yet. The Porsche Taycan is expected to be one of the first when it goes on sale next year. In the public transport sector, meanwhile, wersquore seeing a stronger focus on moving from oil burners to electric buses.Perth-based Stagecoach, who have invested more than pound billion in greener buses over the past ten years, have unveiled a pound million proposal to deliver  zero-emissions double-deckers ndash and the necessary charging infrastructure ndash for Greater Manchester by summer next year.The Enviro EV City buses, which have a range of -plus miles and can carry  passengers, would be built by Scottish company Alexander Dennis.From eco-friendly buses to investment in public and private power points, in the journey to zero-emission transport one thing is clear: despite all of the practical challenges, Scotland really is determined to lead the charge into an EV future.How Far

Coupled with the geopolitical challenges on the horizon ndash from Brexit to Chinarsquos plastic recycling import ban ndashitrsquos understandable that firms are feeling some anxiety. But running an economy on fewer natural resources is a problem that Zero Waste Scotland is determined to crack.We have already seen the cost of raw materials become a big concern for Scottish businesses. Back in January, a Scottish Chamber of Commerce survey revealed that % of businesses were anxious about the rising costs of raw materials and their impact on prices.Responding to these pressures requires big ideas and new ways of doing business. And new ways of thinking are at the heart of the circular economy that Zero Waste Scotland is working with businesses across Scotland to deliver.This article was published in the December edition ofBusinessHQ - click here to viewWe want to help build an economy where resources are valued. Itrsquos a message with an environmental heart but also a hard-headed business sense. As materials become scarcer and costs more prohibitive, the need to make sure we keep them in circulation for as long as possible and extract their full potential economic and social value becomes more urgent.But this challenge has also inspired some great creative thinking.Zero Waste Scotlandrsquos business support service is designed to help companies with big ideas explore more circular ways of doing business which can result in resource efficiencies, improved profitability, higher quality products, increased customer base and alternative supply chains for your business. This support has already helped more than  SMEs in Scotland.Jenner Grfith and Mathew Bonner were at the event to collect EGG Lightingrsquos Circular Breakthrough award at The Heraldrsquos Global Game Changers Awards.One business to benefit from this support has been EGG Lighting, who are working to reduce the waste in LED lighting. LED lighting is much more energy efficient th fluorescent-style lights that us commonplace in most comme industrial buildings. However,with thetechnology advancing at a rapid rate,regular upgrades are leading to high levels of material waste. What makes this all the more frustrating is that while entire units were being disposed of, the technological changes only affected a small part of the physical infrastructure.EGG Lighting had a smart solution to this problem. They designed a modular system that allowed businesses to keep using the same fittings and replace only the parts that were essential for accessing the new technology.For six months, EGG has been working with the Scottish logistics, construction and distribution specialists W H Malcolm to put their modular approach to the test. The trial has been supported by Zero Waste Scotland, with support from European Regional Development Funds and the Scottish Government.EGG is pioneering a service model that would see businesses continue to receive regular upgrades to the technology, but without having to replace the entire unit. That way, they get the benefits of the latest LED technology, without constantly forking out for new lights and without having to dispose of the entire unit.Zero Waste Scotland also offers support through the Circular Economy Investment Fund, which has delivered more than pound million in support from the Scottish Government and the European Regional Development Fund. This funding has helped bring the latest D printing technology to Scotland,turn used coffee grounds into valuable bio-oils and kick start the creation of a transformational plastics recovery plant in Perth.From reducing costs to unlocking new markets, there are clear economic benefits in adopting a more circular approach to resources, products and services.

The MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber continued unchallenged after removing the word ldquoperhaps from his subsequent remarks.In her response, the PM stressed how there was no dference between what Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, had said in a statement to the Commons on Monday and the published legal advice.Later, outwith the chamber, Mr Blackford declared: ldquoItrsquos absolutely conclusive that the PM has misled the House relating to the permanency of the backstop.He replied: ldquoLet us call a spade a spade. On the basishellipshe had the legal advice when she spoke in the House of Commons, then shersquos lied, yes.The published paper from Mr Cox - in bold type - states: ldquoDespite statements in the Protocol that it[the backstop] is not intended to be permanent and the clear intention of the parties that it should be replaced by alternative, permanent arrangements, in international law the Protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its placehellipThe six-page document also said that under the proposed arrangements, \"for regulatory purposes, GB is essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods passing from GB into NI\".Nigel Dodds, the Democratic Unionist Party leader at Westminster, described the legal advice as \"devastating\" and said it made clear the proposed backstop was \"unacceptable\" and must be defeated.Sir Keir Starmer for Labour said the legal advice had confirmed \"the central weaknesses in the Governments deal\".As the PM continued her Commons meetings with Tory MPs, saying she was ldquolistening to the concerns of colleagues about ldquothe way forward, it emerged No  was discussing a plan to give MPs a vote on whether the UK should enter the backstop at all orthe Brexit Plan should be scrapped altogether.But ardent Brexiteer Steve Baker dismissed the Downing St strategy, saying: ldquoIt is silly and few are falling for it.Meanwhile, it was suggested EU chiefs are preparing for a May defeat by putting the issue of extending Article  on the agenda for the December European Council, which takes place two days after next Tuesdayrsquos Commons vote.The continuing row at Westminster came as Holyrood formally voted against both Mrs Mays Brexit deal and the prospect of quitting the EU with no deal in place.MSPs voted by  to  for a motion which said both these options \"would be damaging for Scotland and the nations and regions of the UK as a whole\".As a result, they called for the Brexit deal to be rejected when it is voted on at Westminster on December  and for \"a better alternative be taken forward\".Today, David Mundell will open up a new front in the Brexit row when he calls on Nicola Sturgeon to ldquoopen her ears to Scottish business and back the PMrsquos withdrawal plan.In a speech in London, the Scottish Secretary will say: ldquoIf she genuinely wants to represent Scotlandrsquos views she has to stop lecturing and start listening.ldquoIf she listened, shersquod know we have a workable solution. If she listened, shersquod understand how little appetite there is for simply prolonging the uncertainty. She also claims we must avoid no-deal. If she listened, shersquod realise the only sure way to achieve that is to support the deal.In response, the SNP MSP Tom Arthur declared: ldquoDavid Mundell is so delusional he is fast becoming the Comical Ali of Brexit. His claims that this is a choice between the PMrsquos Bad Deal and no-deal have already been completely demolished by Theresa Mayrsquos humiliating Commons defeats and by the opinion from the European Court of Justice."},{"url":null,"title":"huge-cave-system-could-be-scotlands-longest-and-most-spectacular","story":"But two Scots have discovered what is believed to be the countryrsquos longest cave after coming across the nettle-choked entrance by chance as they explored the area.Geologist Iain Greig of Aberdeen and Neal Menzies from Stonehaven were exploring an area about two miles south of Durness in Sutherland last June.Around  yards from the road in the North West Highlands Geopark, a geological area which is home to a number of limestone caves, they stumbled across an innocuous looking entrance which was blocked by vegetation.Theexperienced cavers believe that it could directly to the world-renowned Smoo Cave near the village which is a distance of around four miles away.When the men entered what has now been called the Cave of the Black Stones, they found the way blocked by silt but it was heading northwards towards Smoo Cave, following the course of River Dionard.Experts have long believed the thin line limestone rock which is flanked on either side by harder rocks has had the potential to be full of cave formations as surface water drains straight through the soil even in the heaviest rain.Now a team of cavers is to mount an expedition to drill through the silt which will allow them to explore the system in full.But during the initial visit they discovered a freshwater eel which they believe has never been exposed to sunlight.Mr Greig, , said: ldquoWe were not expecting what we found. It was full of nettles and less than a metre wide. We managed to enter it and there was a section of boulders ndash we moved them out of the way and then there was a ft drop. That led to a spectacular chamber  yards by  feet ndash big enough to stand up in. The stones were blue and purple. It was some incredible sight.ldquoWe managed to explore  yards before finding the route choked with sediment. We plan towith a team in the New Year to dig it out and explore further.ldquoThe theory and hope is it could extend all the way to Smoo Cave which would make it by far the longest cave in Scotland and with the most spectacular of entrances ndash or exits, depending on the start point ndash at Smoo.Scotlandrsquos longest cave is currently the Cave of the Sloping Rock in nearby Assynt which is . miles long.The longest cave system in the UK is the Three Counties System in the Yorkshire Dales, with . miles of passageway, while the longest in the world is the appropriately-named Mammonth Cave in Brownsville, Kentucky with more than  miles explored.Smoo Cave is the largest coastline cave in the British Isles and has provided shelter for thousands of years. It is believed to have been a Stone Age home more than , years ago with Norse settlers later gathering here to repair boats and fish for herring.It has one of the largest entrances to any sea cave in Britain at  ft high. It was formed by a burn that runs down into the rear chamber, as well as erosion caused by the sea.Mr Greig added: ldquoIf it links up to the new discovery it will be one of the best caving experiences in the UK. It is a treasure trove for geologists. Over the two days we have explored the new cave we even found a white freshwater eel which has never seen sunlight.ldquoThe drought helped us because the cave floods in wet conditions, and up to the roof in places. Itrsquos like a big treasure hunt, but we do not know what the treasure is yet. It is what most cavers dream of. This is the final frontier of exploration in Scotland. Every inch of the country has been mapped by satellite ndash itrsquos what remains under the surface that remains the big mystery.Fellow caver Colin Coventry, who for more than  years has led tours at Smoo Cave, added: ldquoFor many years I have been convinced that Smoo was linked to one long cave. We believe the biggest cave in Scotland is here and waiting to be found.ldquoThis looks like it. But it is spectacularly dangerous.ldquoI would certainly not take tours there. However this is one of the most exciting finds for many years."},{"url":null,"title":"no-10-talks-up-greater-trade-collaboration-between-uk-and-scottish-governments","story":"Earlier this week, David Mundell spoke enthusiastically about a ldquocombined approach to future trade missions, which could in theory see the Prime Minister and First Minister joining forces to get the best deals for the UK and Scotland.Appearing before the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee, the Scottish Secretary told MPs he would welcome a move to more joint trade delegations as this would produce better value for taxpayers.On occasions, UK and Scottish Government representatives have visited the same country but separately.Mr Mundell told the committee: ldquoI am very open and conducive to working together.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond. Sadly the whole of our public sector is suffering from the impact of funding cuts and we must now end austerity and fund the le line services that our people need.Share your views by emailing us at newsdesk@spp-groupThursday  Dec  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However, it has also led to rapid change which, for many people, has meant the decline of their communities whose economic reason to exist has moved where. We may have record numbers in employment, but many people find themselves stuck in low-paid, insecure jobs. People are angry, and justiably so. People have seen their pay cut and opportunities diminish while those driving the economy got richer even when it was their decisions had made millions poorer. The excesses of capitalism must be addressed. We must enact economic reforms to ensure a fairer society. Liberal democracy is based on markets, free trade and free enterprise. But these need to be servants, not masters of a liberal society. One major issue is the UK economy is consumer driven. We inflate the value of our real estate, borrow against these assets and buy goods and services which mostly we don’t produce.One way to tackle this would be to introduce land-value taxation. This would not only discourage speculative land hoarding, but it is an initial step in introducing taxes on wealth rather than income. It ensures that those iniduals with high-value net worth contribute fairly to the community. Land and property speculation should no longer be the principal driver of our economy.In Germany, their economy is driven by investmentand skills and company ownership is held more through direct investors and workers, rather than institutional shareholders looking for short-term gains. The Liberal Democrats have long called for workers representative on boards, the encouragement of worker share ownership, and partnerships and supervisory boards with wider responsibilities than just shareholder . Liberal Democrats believe that it is vital that everyone is given a stake in our economy, that we can only be united and competitive as a countrythe rewards are reaped by all.: Brexit deal will cost us £bn, says Nicola SturgeonThe UK still suffers tension between the roles of the state and the private sector, instead of the promotion of creative partnership. People are also being confronted with utilities raising prices ahead of inflation whilst delivering poor service. Rail services are equally expensive and unreliable.To answer this, Labour has revitalised its Marxist-Leninist credentials and is proposing wholesale nationalisation. To a younger generation with no memory of the Soviet Union or the tussles over Clause  of the Labour Party constitution, it might seem attractive to bring gas, electricity, water and the railways back into public ownership.After all, wouldn’t that mean fuel bills would be kept down and the trains would run on time with lower fares  Not necessarily. British Rail was famous for dreadful food, poor timekeeping and under-investment.How would Labour pay for the shares and how would utilities and railways secure funding in competition with health, education, and welfare  Seizing the assets would destroy investment and collapse pension funds. It would be far better to give consumers and rail passengers a more direct role in the running of these companies, rather than having to own them.: Police Scotland officers could be sent to Northern Ireland during BrexitMuch of the inequality in the United Kingdom can be attributed to where you live. Therefore, it is vital we unlock the positive energy of our communities. In Scotland, having our own Parliament with signicant powers gives us control of our domestic affairs to address our distinctive needs and culture. We should be using those powers to pursue policies to improve our quality of le and strengthen our economy, which remains too dependent on the public sector. That does not mean we should cut public sector funding or privatise sectors. Rather we should seek to grow the private sector and with it the tax base.However, we have seen over the past year what little regard the Conservative Government has for devolving powers. The Brexit process has been abused with powers being taken to Whitehall that should have been devolved. The loss of £. billion of European Structural and Investment Funds is only likely to make the problems faced by disadvantaged areas worse. Local authorities must have their powers and sources of funding guaranteed. Local autonomy with real financial muscle is the only sustainable answer to the regional ide. That is why the Government must support our call to devolve more decision-making power over key levers of economic development including transport, housing and skills. We must do more to tackle regional inequality where you are born should not affect your chance of prosperity.All of this makes clear that it is time for a new People’s Contract. We must end the politics of ision, espoused in ious forms by the Tories, Labour and the SNP and bring the country together. When looking at the referendum vote, we must not only call for a People’s Vote to end the Brexit chaos in the short term, but we must address why people voted leave in the first place. If we are to achieve a fairer, less ided society we must reform our economy so that everyone has the means to get by and the chance to get on.Malcolm Bruce is the Liberal Democrat’s spokesperson for Northern Ireland  Scotland in the House of Lords©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4840057.1544088434!/image/image.jpg","title":"david mundell urges nicola sturgeon to listen to business on brexit deal","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Scottish Secretary will urge Nicola Sturgeon to listen to Scottish businesses on the Brexit deal, in a speech in London today.The Scottish Secretary will urge Nicola Sturgeon to listen to Scottish businesses on the Brexit deal, in a speech in London today.David Mundell will say the First Minister has to “stop lecturing and start listening” to businesses north of the Border that back the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement as an alternative to a no-deal Brexit.

A total of  per cent of Scottish Conservative voters feel that immigration is good for the economy compared to  per cent south of the Border.Sir John said there did not appear to be any consistent link in Scotland between identity and perceptions of the economic consequences of migration.He said SNP voters in  holding positive views about migration helped create the impression Scotland as a whole did as well.But Sir John argued those Scots who supported other parties were less positive about immigration.“Consequently, although the balance of opinion about migration is much the same in Scotland as in the rest of Britain, the link between attitudes towards the subject and how people vote at election time is somewhat dferent north of the Border,” he said.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4840069.1544086386!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish new car sales motor ahead","story":"Scotland#s car dealers notched up a  per cent rise in new registrations last month, bucking the downward trend seen where in the UK.Industry leaders pointed to a resilient start to December after figures showed , new cars were registered to Scottish addresses during November, up from , in the same month a year earlier.Sandy Burgess, chief executive of the Scottish Motor Trade Association, said: “ has proved to be a very unsettling year for our industry, with the shortage of products that we experienced in our peak selling month of September due to the new WLTP regulations and the effects of that dreaded word Brexit on the consumer confidence.“It really is testimony to the resilience of the Scottish market that we are experiencing growth in the twilight months of the year.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England. On hishe took the Republican side in the Civil War and saw action against the Free Staters.John James Kelly was a man of the left - he spoke often to his son about Lenin. In the s and s, because of his Republican views, he found it dficult to make a living but he remained in the IRA and was elected to its Executive Council. He was  years old when he died.CharlieMcCafferty was OC of the IRAs st Tir Conaill Battalionat the time of his death. He was born in  and he too joined the IRA at a young age. In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours. They were buried eighty years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"suzanne breen unionists united in opposition as remainers rally around backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"deputy mayor insists primark must pay for security around burntout bank buildings","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Any claims against Primarks policy of insurance as a result of the fire will be handled by our insurers directly but it would not be appropriate for us to comment further.\"On Monday, Argento, McDonalds and Skechers reopened in the city centre, followed by Spar on Tuesday.

would not postpone.Mrs May told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “There will be a choice between,we get to that point, a choice between going into the backstop and extending the transition period.“Now, there are pros and cons of both sides of that.“People have a concern of the backstop, that we could be in it indefinitely.“But, in the backstop we have no financial obligations, we have no free movement, we have very light level playing field rules with the EU.“In the implementation period, we still have to negotiate the terms, but there will be concerns about the fact that they would require, I’m sure they would require, some more money to be paid, for example.If it comes to the point where the Government makes, shows, a determination to implement the Withdrawal Agreement with its

of the UK in making these decisions.“And, the obvious, in terms of the UK, is for it to be Parliament that makes these decisions.”The backstop, intended to prevent theof a hard border in Northern Ireland, is highly controversial as Brexiteer MPs claim it traps the UK into obeying rules set by Brussels without a say over them.The Government insists it aims to conclude a comprehensive trade deal with the EU before a backstop arrangement would be needed.Mrs May said that any deal with the EU, such as a Canada-style free trade agreement favoured by some Brexiteers, would also require a backstop

In a just-published report by the QAA, damning criticism about the college potentially putting academic standards at risk occurs no fewer than six times.The QAA monitors standards in higher education institutions across the UK. The watchdogs inspectors looked at a number of aspects of teaching, learning and assessment specically related to the courses run by the Presbyterian Theological Faculty Ireland .A spokesman for UTC said the college had made \"signicant progress\", but conceded \"there is still some work to be done\" and added: \"The college is working fully with the QAA.\"Rachael Gee, head of assurance at the QAA, said a full review of UTC due in  had been brought forward to  as a result of the latest report, and that the college had been informed.\"If any monitoring visit receives an outcome of further improvement required, we bring forward the review to between six and nine months to make sure that the provider is meeting the appropriate standards,\" she explained. \"UTC has been told the full review is being brought forward. We confirmed that when we published the report.\"In the event of a negative full review next year, Ms Gee said: \"A direct consequence is that they would be made a legacy Tier Four sponsor, so they would not be able to recruit any more international students.\"A number of specic failings were mentioned in the QAAs comprehensive assessment carried out in October, which relates to programmes unconnected to Queens. They include:• Incomplete documentation of the academic framework for PTFI programmes and alignment with the framework for higher education qualications • Faculty failure to monitor and review teaching, learning and assessment across all pathways and within all courses and modules.• No formal defined mechanism to consider and respond to issues raised by external examiners.UTC said it was continuing to work on improvements.A spokesman added: \"We welcome the fact that the QAA said in their report that the college is making progress with continuing to monitor, review and enhance its higher education provision since the October  monitoring visit, but further improvement is required. The areas the college is working on include terms of reference and membership of each of its academic committees, a robust protocol for the appointment of PTFI external examiners, and clear evidence of student involvement in all decisions related to PTFI and the ministry training pathway.\" UTC has  students at present,  of whom are studying for theology degrees at Queens.Another  students are preparing to enter the Presbyterian ministry by studying on courses run by the PTFI.The report acknowledges that Queens \"has recently undertaken a review of its relationship with the college in September  and the report of this review is not yet published\".There has been speculation, however, that the university intends to sever its links with the historic institution.A spokeswoman for Queens refused to speculate on any possible split.\"The university has received a copy of the QAA educational oversight report and is considering the findings. We have no further comment to make,\" she said.It is believed that one of the factors in QUBs decision to re-examine its relationship with Union College was the suspension of Professor Laurence Kirkpatrick after comments he made about the ages of his employers staff."},{"url":null,"title":"nigel dodds prime minister must bin the backstop and work for a better deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"david mundell snp misleading people on alternative brexit plan","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

lied about the temporary nature of the Brexit backstop plan, Mr Mundell said the only duplicity was coming from SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford.Mocking the dramatic SNP walkout from Westminster earlier this year, the Scottish Secretary said Mr Blackford’s latest PMQs attack on Theresa May was using language to “draw attention to himself” in “another stunt”.I dont think anybody has been

backing Mrs May’s deal to avoid a no deal Brexit, because he believed there was no credible alternative availableMPs vote down the Government’s plan next Tuesday.“There are other people who believe, fancully, there is some other deal out there in the ether and they just need to vote this deal down for it to materialise in their Christmas stocking,” he said. “That is not going to happen.“The  deal that is one the table is the realistic option that’s available.“None of the other speculated options we can say at this moment are credibly with a chance of achieving majority support in Parliament.”But, following a speech to business leaders urging support for Mrs May’s deal, Mr Mundell admitted he was not “totally comfortable” with the details around Northern Ireland.The Scottish Secretary has previously suggested he could resigna dferential arrangement was reached, but insisted Northern Ireland would not be given a competitive advantage over Scotland by the “carefully tailored” deal.He said: “I have looked at the detail of the proposals for Northern Ireland and I have been quite clear I am not totally comfortable with those arrangements.“If you weigh up what’s the greatest threat to the integrity of the UK, my judgement is that’s having no deal, chaotic Brexit from the EU – I regard that as the most unsatisfactory outcome in terms of standing up for the integrity of the UK.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May’s Brexit deal is the best way forward, David Mundell said When asked why Mrs May refused to rule out the damaging no deal Brexit he claimed to want to avoid, Mr Mundell said the draft deal was the only solution.“She’s making the case for her deal because her deal is the best way to avoid that threat,” he said.“Even Mrs May’s most passionate critic couldn’t say she has not done that as vigorously and with as much effort as could possibly have been done because… She believes that voting for that deal is way to resolve these

Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -. Relief rather than elation from the home supporters as they made their way home.Ballynahinch Banbridge AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaign to clamp down on dog fouling  ","story":"LOCAL council officials have unveiled a new campaign aimed at helping rid the district of its dog fouling problem.It is a particularly contentious issue and one of the single most complained about problems in the area and, despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed and there is virtually no town or village not affected by it.This week, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has launched a new awareness campaign to remind dog owners about the importance of cleaning up after their dogs.Rolled out after a survey by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul found that levels of dog fouling had increased from the previous year, the local authority is determined to get a grip on the issue.One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.While the mindset of these particular iniduals is hard to fathom and it is concerning that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind, council officials hope the new campaign can change minds.Dog owners are being reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so is leaving them open to an pound fine.In addition, dog owners are reminded that they are responsible for training their dogs properly to lsquodo their businessrsquo in their ownerrsquos garden where it can then be collected and placed in a black bin.Politicians have become increasingly frustrated at the blatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and council officials are prepared to do all they can to tackle the problem. Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar pet Pedro is purr fect for cat pageant  ","story":"A CROSSGAR cat has been strutting his fluff on the red carpet after being short-listed for a prestigious kitty pageant.Pedro has been selected as a finalist in the Crown Your Cat competition organised by Mackle Petfoods.Eighteen month-old Pedro, an American Maine Coon, is owned by Ciara Fullam, who is delighted with her furry felinersquos success.Ciararsquos certain that Pedro was the lsquopurr-fectrsquo Christmas present when she got him in Tipperary last December.ldquoPedro is no ordinary cat, she says: ldquoI had always wanted a Maine Coon because they are known to be a hardy breed.ldquoI saw a picture of Pedro, then a kitten. I fell in love with him right away and brought him home to live with us.ldquoIrsquom convinced he thinks of himself as a dog rather than a cat though. When hersquos in the mood he will play lsquofetchrsquo.ldquoIn fact, it doesnrsquot stop there. He is quite independent like a dog. Hersquos not what we would call a lap cat at all. He does love company but is happy enough to just watch you most of the time from a distance.ldquoAnd hersquos not afraid of water either. Enjoying a nice warm bath when the notion takes him and jumping into the river on occasion to go for a swim is often on his to-do list when the weather is good.But Pedro comes alive when the weather is at its worst. ldquoHis breed hails from the state of Maine in the USA, Ciara explained. ldquoThey are larger than your average cat and bred to survive severe weather conditions. Last winter he was quite at home with our plummeting temperatures.Easily adapting to le in Crossgar, Pedro has a cunning side to him that isnrsquot obvious when you first meet him, says Ciara.ldquoInstead of the usual meeowww sound a cat would make Pedro chirps like a little bird. I can imagine him duping a few unsuspecting birds with this cunning little characteristic.Ciara added: ldquoEven though there are three of us in the house, myself, my partner and my  year old son, Pedro is definitely the king. Hersquos over a year old now and hersquos still growing.Laura Rafferty, spokeswoman at Mackle Petfoods, said: ldquoWe had entries coming in from all over Ireland and competition to be top cat was furrr-ocious.ldquoWersquore down to four fury finalists which includes Pedro and wersquoll be announcing the overall winner next month.Pedro is keeping his adoring fans up to date with his Instagram account, @PedrodaBatCat..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Drumaness ‘Scor’ superb win in county final  ","story":"DRUMANESS GAC were the only East Down winners at the Scoacuter na nOacuteg county finals at the weekend when they picked up the Leiacuteruiacute Statise crown.The th anniversary of Scoacuter always had the potential to be a special year of celebrations, and on Sunday night in St Malachyrsquos High School, Castlewellan, patrons witnessed one of the best the county has ever had.There was standing room only in the packed hall when Bean a Tiacute Ciara Pickering got proceedings underway.Ballycran, Mayobridge, Dromara and Saval danced it out for the county title in ceili dancing with Mayobridge emerging as champions for the first time in their clubrsquos history.Solo singing was next on stage with Glasdrummanrsquos Niamh McDowell, Dundrumrsquos Cathleen Garland, Clonduffrsquos Aoe Trainor and Portaferryrsquos Niamh Savage involved in a tightly-fought competition.You could have heard a pinwhen these girls preformed, and it was Aoe Trainor who emerged victorious at the end of the evening.Staying with the solo competitions, it was reciters Jack and Brian McGreevy from Clonduff, Ballycranrsquos Beibhinn Watson and Saulrsquos Aoe Sands who entertained the appreciative audience in another high standard competition and Clonduff collected their second county title when Brian McGreevy was announced the winner.The ballad group was the final competition of the first half. The standard was simply amazing, the work and arrangements the four clubs mdash Glasdrumman, Saul, Clonduff and Portaferry mdash had put into their two songs was fantastic and it was certainly a tough competition to have to pick a winner.It was tremendous delight to all in Glasdrumman when they were announced county champions, another first county title for them in their club history.Half-time was a much-appreciated break for adjudicators as the pressure was all on their shoulders trying to get winners from the amazing standard that they had witnessed in the first half and the second half didnrsquot disappoint.Leiacuteruiacute Statise saw Drumaness beat off rivals from Saval and Clann na Banna to the coveted title.

Last year five pupils were retained and this term eight were held back.The practice was put under the microscope by the Education Boardrsquos Educational Services Committee recently when a committee member asked for it to be discontinued.Mr J Scott said he was concerned that all children should have equal opportunities and that no pupils should have an advantage over othersCROSSGAR mdash The threat of closure that has been overshadowing the future of Crossgar War Memorial Hall was lted at a special public meeting. Over  local residents rallied in response to a desperate plea for help issued by the hallrsquos management committee.Lack of support and use of the hall forced the committee to present an ultimatums to the townsfolk to either take an interest in the hall, or have it closed down.This unprecedented appeal certainly produced results as Mr W J Cochrane said when he addressed a packed meeting.ldquoI am delighted to see so many people here, he said. ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet. It is vitally important that the hall is managed by a thoughtful and inventive committee to ensure a safe passage out of our present dficulties.ldquoUnless the committee can come up with ways of obtaining sustained financial assistance, the threat of closure is still real.Mr Cochrane explained that while many repairs had been carried out, there was still a lot to do. Mr P J Smyth conducted the election of the committee to which  people were appointed.SAUL mdash Saul writer P J Lennon will have his play, lsquoThe Brairden Stonersquo, broadcast on radio for the sixth time early next year.The play was first featured on the air in the mid-sixties and broadcast by both BBC and Radio Telefis Eireann.

Apart from completing the popular Myles Stone Diary each week in the Down Recorder, he finds time to continue his work writing radio plays.KILLINCHY mdash Plans to build a new primary school in Killinchy are to go ahead quickly mdash despite mounting objections from local residents.The new school will mean the closure of nearby Ballydrain Primary School and is to be built on a site which is causing anxiety in one of the villagersquos housing estates.The residents of Ardview Park have petitioned the South Eastern Education and Library Board about the new site because they are worried about two proposed entrances.The Board met this week to decide finally on a problem that has held back a decision for several months and agreed to proceed with the development.Mr Jack Magee, a Board member from Downpatrick, said there would be some annoyance during building operations, but when work is completed there should be no cause for complaint.A Board officer pointed out that there was no compulsion on the children to to transfer to a particular school and that many of them might to go Andrews Memorial School in Comber rather than Killlinchy.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The curtain will lt on Friday night on the opera lsquoCinderalla in Salernorsquo in Assumption Grammar School.The opera, which will also be staged on Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday, is being put on by pupils at the school with Miss S OrsquoHanlon and Miss M Scullion the producers.PORTAFERRY mdash Declan Mackell, the yachtsman who sailed into Portaferry at the end of his triumphant lone Atlantic crossing, plans to set off next year on a round the world trip.Declan estimates the voyage will take two years and when it is over he hopes to set up home in Portaferry.Declan intends to leave Portaferry is his -feet long yacht and head to France.

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Neal and Chris win pairs competition  ","story":"NEAL and Chris Ross ped only one frame on their way to winning the Ballynahinch and District Pool League Pairs competition.The intrepid duo beat Rowallanersquos Tony Mageean and Darryl Ashby - in the last eight and followed that up with another - victory over Internationalrsquos Peter Kelly and Gary Reid.This set up a showdown with Robbie Todd and Duane Croskery from the International after they had accounted for team-mates Paul Gordon and Gary Medwell.It was a one-sided final and the Ross boys had too much firepower for Gordon and Medwell as they ran out comfortable - winners.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us. We are delighted with their support which I believe says a lot about this area. Our staff and parents are also very committed and we are involved in a shared education project with Sacred Heart Primary in Dundrum.Sara added: ldquoOur neighbours at St Colmcillersquos Primary School are also supporting us with the P pupils selecting Knockevin as their chosen charity and when some of the pupils visited us recently they used makaton signing to communicate with some of our students.ldquoI am lucky to be the principal of a school which enjoys the warmth and support of so many people.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
