Well, he can probably. But it would not be good.\u0027 After the large migration into Europe in 2015, Europe has been reinforcing its borders to discourage the arrival of more migrants and refugees. Still, every year, tens of thousands try to get in, embarking on dangerous and sometimes deadly journeys by sea and land.Since the summer, thousands have been lured by what appeared to be a new and easier way to slip into Europe, through Belarus.The EU accuses Lukashenko of creating the artificial route in order to retaliate for sanctions against his regime imposed after an election in 2020 widely viewed as flawed and a harsh crackdown on internal dissent that followed.The restrictions were toughened after an incident in May when a passenger jet flying from Greece to Lithuania was erted by Belarus to Minsk, where authorities arrested dissident journalist Raman Pratasevich. The EU called it air piracy, barred Belarusian carriers from its skies and cut imports of the country\u0027s top commodities, including petroleum products and potash, an ingredient in fertilizer.A furious Lukashenko shot back by saying he would no longer abide by an agreement to stem illegal migration, arguing that the EU sanctions deprived his government of funds needed to contain flows of migrants.

The agreement fails to call for the phasing out of all fossil fuels and all fossil fuel subsidies – demonstrating the lack of ambition and bold action needed at this critical time. In addition, the focus on carbon offsetting by rich countries, without even putting in place adequate environmental and human rights protection measures, ignores the threat to Indigenous peoples and communities who risk being evicted from their land to make way for these schemes. It is a hollow and unacceptable substitute for real zero emissions targets. “The decisions made by our leaders in Glasgow have grave consequences for all of humanity. As they have clearly forgotten the people they serve, the people must come together to show them what can be achieved. Over the next 12 months, we must stand together to call on our governments to take ambitious action on climate change that puts people and human rights at its centre. If we do not put our hearts and minds into solving this existential threat to humanity, we lose everything.”“Leaders have catastrophically betrayed humanity at large by failing to protect people most affected by the climate crisis and instead caving into the interests of fossil fuel and other powerful corporations,” the organisation said.  Amnesty’s Secretary General, Agnès Callamard added that the conference “failed to deliver an outcome” that protects the planet or people. “Instead it has betrayed the very foundations on which the United Nations was built – a pledge first not to countries, nor states, but to the people. Throughout their negotiations, our leaders have made choices that ignore, chip away or bargain away our rights as human beings, often discarding the most marginalised communities around the world as expendable collateral damage,” Callamard said.  “Their failure to commit to maintaining the global temperature rise at 1.5°C will condemn more than half a billion people, mostly in the global south, to insufficient water and hundreds of millions of people to extreme heatwaves. Despite this disastrous scenario, wealthy countries have failed to commit money towards compensating communities suffering loss and damage as a result of climate change. Neither have they committed to providing climate finance to developing countries primarily as grants, a decision that threatens poorer countries – the least equipped to cope with the climate crisis - with unsustainable levels of debt.’s environment correspondent Fiona Harvey provides insight into how Britain kept Cop26 alive. Build Back Better focuses on a long list of social policies and programs ranging from education to healthcare to housing to climate.  “The Build Back Better Framework will be the largest effort to combat climate change in American history—and through this effort, we’ll grow industries here in the United States create good-paying union jobs and combat environmental injustice,” Biden said.  “Countries still lack the radical ambition to avert disaster – this accord goes nowhere near far enough,” the piece states. Read the full story below.  Sharma praised the “hard work” and “great cooperation” from negotiators, ministers and all the parties.  “I would say, however, that this is a fragile win,” he said in a statement. “We have kept 1.5 alive. That was our overarching objective when we set off on this journey two years ago, taking on the role of the COP presidency-designate. “But I would still say that the pulse of 1.5 is weak.  “That is why, whilst we have reached, I do believe, a historic agreement. What this will be judged on, is not just the fact that countries have signed up, but on whether they meet and deliver on the commitments.”“I know you might be disappointed. But we’re in the fight of our lives \u0026amp this fight must be won,” António Guterres said in a statement over Twitter.  “Never give up. I am with you.” “If we do what we promise here, humanity will learn to live within planetary boundaries,” he told the conference.  “We have almost 200 countries coming together on an agenda of such ambition that we have not seen since Paris. And I’ll give you one promise. It doesn’t stop here. It only starts.” After two weeks of talks, a climate deal has finally been struck which may take us a step closer to holding temperatures to a rise of 1.5C. It’s been a long ride for most of us, including COP26 president Alok Sharma.  Asked about being emotional in the meeting, Sharma said he had six hours’ sleep in three days. “It is emotional - collectively we have achieved what I suspect very many people doubted until the last few days.” Stay tuned as the world reacts. “We’ve kept 1.5 alive and made huge progress on coal, cars, cash and trees,” he said late Sunday.  And while there is still so much that needs to be done to save our planet, we’ll look back at COP26 as the moment humanity finally got real about climate change.”  “COP26 is a step in the right direction. 1.5 degrees Celsius remains within reach but the work is far from done,” she tweeted.  “The least we can do now is implement the promises of Glasgow as rapidly as possible and then aim higher.” The European Commission president reiterated the three objectives, noting progress has been made. “First, to get commitments to cut emissions also during this decade, to keep within reach the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.  “Second, to reach the target of 100 billion dollars per year of climate finance to developing and vulnerable countries. “And third, to get agreement on the Paris rulebook. “We have made progress on all three objectives,” she said. Things are calming down at the SEC conference centre, but no doubt the reaction will continue to pour in. My colleague Samantha Lock will be taking over shortly, and you can reach her as samantha.lock@the or find her on Twitter at @samantha__lockHe attacks leaders for offering “empty words”, accuses them of “prioritising profits over black and brown lives”, and says they have “utmost disdain for the science”.“And yes, there is work to be done and we will contribute to that. But I think the key issue is to recognise that loss and damage is an issue that deserves a lot of consideration.” Asked what the consequences should be for countries like Australia which suggested they might refuse the call back to the table next year, Sharma said simply that “all countries signed up to this and it’s an international agreement”.He said: “I’ve seen for myself that when people talk about 1.5 to keep alive, that’s precisely what it means. So I understand the sense of disappointment. But what was really important for me was to get a deal over the line.” “Of course I wish that we had managed to preserve the language on coal that was originally agreed. But nevertheless, we do have language on coal on phase down, I don’t think anyone at the start of this process thought that would be retained but it has”.“That is down to the flexibility and the goodwill shown by many of the parties here today.” He said he wanted to thank “ all the parties who showed such grace in agreeing to it.”Asked about being emotional during the meeting, he said he had had about six hours’ sleep in the past three days. “You know, it is emotional in the sense that, collectively as a team we have achieved what I suspect very many people doubted probably up until the last few days. So of course, it’s emotional but the hard work starts here”.“I did go around and test the language with a whole range of groups and parties. It is because of the trust that the UK has built up in the past few years that people were able to accept the language at the end of the day, very reluctantly of course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39cc22a73f0d8e418fb6eef48a699473d26eff26/0_93_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a0b80ce6329cf11d6e4fcb2e24b69266","title":"strictly come dancing 2021 week eight live","story":"Please join me then, and let me know in the comments below who you think is heading home this week.

Illustration: Michael VineyThe most seductive soup I ever tasted was served in an elegant cup on a posh night out at Delphi House in Doolough Pass on the other side of the mountain. Its intense, creamy essence was that of chanterelles, small, fluted yellow mushrooms, smelling of apricots, that grow in the wooded valley around the hotel. I had, in more innocent times, gathered them there myself, trespassing in what is now, behind the fence, strictly chef’s territory. Chanterelles are probably the chief prize for this autumn’s mushroom gatherers, ahead even of ceps and blewits. And the chances are that the delighted cries of their harvesters will have frequent Polish intonations, since it is our eastern European settlers who make autumn expeditions to the woods. There will also be, by all accounts, a sprinkling of Irish fungi-fanciers abroad, gazing at the ground in the hope of a quite different species: rather simple-looking little mushrooms that may or may not contain the psychedelic drug psilocybin. As with all mushroom gathering, wrong choices or guesses risk drastic impacts, so many devotees of “mushies, shrooms, liberties or magics” prefer to obtain them online. The accompanying good advice may still be no protection against wrong decisions on how much to swallow at a time. In 2005, a 33-year-old man jumped to his death in Dublin after ingesting hallucinogenic mushrooms at a party. Until that point, “head shops” had openly and legally sold them. After this, the government moved swiftly to ban them. The Psychedelic Society of Ireland, founded by Ciara Sherlock, held its first, enthusiastic, 100-strong meeting in Dublin’s Temple Bar in 2016. Its practitioners are adamant that psychedelic substances are safe if used responsibly and with a sitter to look after people. And the value of mind-changing psilocybic experience in treating depression has gained ground with reputable psychiatrists, notably at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.Demons of the unconscious The interest in psychedelic experience blossomed in the US in the 1960s as a largely hippy culture experimented with LSD, the hallucinogen found in ergot, a grain fungus affecting rye. They were strongly encouraged to “turn on, tune in, drop out” by Tim O’Leary, a Harvard psychiatrist. Visiting San Francisco at that time, in research for a report on fringe treatments for schizophrenia, I was invited by a hospital psychiatrist to take LSD in laboratory conditions. I declined, being timid and wary of demons that might lurk in my unconscious. Only recently, in his revelatory and much-praised book Entangled Life, the UK ecologist Merlin Sheldrake reported on his own monitored trip with LSD. Asked to assess the experience in a psychometric questionnaire, he was left confused: “How can one measure the experience of timelessness? How can one measure the experience of unity with an ultimate reality?” In using the drug experience in modern therapy, Sheldrake concludes that “psychedelics open a window of mental flexibility”, offering escape from the toughened habits of addiction or depression.Entangled Life traces the long history of use of psychoactive plants and fungi, often interwoven with spiritual beliefs and rituals.Elves and fairiesIreland does not supply the makings of ayahuasca, but it does grow a highly toxic and hallucinogenic fungus often first encountered in children’s story books. Fly agaric or Amanita muscaria is the mushroom with a bright red cap spotted with white warts, from the land of elves and fairies. Its particular abundance in northern conifer forests comes with bizarre accounts of its drug use – still current, says Sheldrake. among shamans in parts of Siberia.In Ireland’s Generous Nature, his encyclopaedic account of plant uses, botanist Peter Wyse Jackson quoted a more explicit Irish source for customs employing fly agaric. In the 18th century, Oliver Goldsmith wrote that the poor Tartars of Koraki in northern Russia would gather around the huts of richer people getting high (or very sick) from eating the fungi. When these people came out for a pee, the poor kulaks would collect their urine – a “delicious fluid”, wrote Goldsmith, and “of this they drink with the utmost satisfaction, and thus they get as drunk and as jovial as their betters”. Such second-hand imbibing of fly agaric’s essence is widely recorded in Europe, but Wyse Jackson could not find any evidence of parallel Irish endeavours. It’s more appealing, I suppose, than rich man’s piss."},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 10 things we know about the climate summit","story":"NGO\u0027s and activists reflect on two weeks in Glasgow and what has been achieved.  Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd1.5 degrees is now in the driving seat: Despite vague language in much of the final declaration and too many “urges” and not enough “decides to”, Cop26 has delivered a big win.It is by way of acknowledgement the world – all 197 countries backing the 2015 Paris Agreement – has to get on a track rapidly to keep temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees to avoid dangerous climate impacts.Critically, key resolutions to pursue greenhouse gas emissions cuts in line with holding global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees were retained.This must be reinforced by “best available science”. It means countries will no longer get away with “we’re striving to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees” – the notorious political fudge that got the Paris pact across the line.The 2.4 degrees reality check: Promises committing to cut emissions (mitigation) in “nationally-determined contributions” were significantly strengthened in the run up to and during Cop26 summit, following relentless pushing for increased ambition by hosts the UK government – with the “keep 1.5 degrees alive” reminders at every turn.Ireland did its bit by rowing in with its 51 per cent cut. Our poor delivery on achieving cuts remains an issue, but that target means we are among those showing most ambition.After week 1, analysts suggested it all added up to the world being on target for less than 2 degrees, and maybe even 1.8 degrees a historic first. It injected optimism into negotiations.The sucker punch was later when Climate Action Tracker – the most reliable modellers in the world – said no, commitments if delivered would mean a 2.4-degree world. In short, an uninhabitable Earth more intense and ferocious extreme weather events and sea level rise of several metres this century. Trigger gloom at Cop26.It was agreed nations will be asked to return next year to strengthen their so far inadequate targets on emissions cuts – 1.5 degrees has yet to be kept alive but direction of travel is clear.The terrible “here and now” scenario: Global leaders including Taoiseach Micheál Martin landed for the first two days and in upbeat fashion backed greater ambition and participated in a flurry of announcements in form of alliances between various combinations of countries on coal phase out addressing deforestation, methane and unhinging vast amounts of private capital.Going into complex negotiations, that appetite for greater collective action dissipated as some big emitter states reverted to type.It was almost as if too many parties didn’t believe the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that concluded the climate crisis is here and now – and no place is safe.US envoy for climate John Kerry, and others, repeatedly underlined mitigation the key lever to force down global temperatures and should be “science, fact based not ideological or political”. There may be the promise of technological solutions such as “carbon capture and storage” to get to net zero. But this is unproven at scale so “we can’t bank on that ...We have to act now.”Methane moves centre stage: The superwarming greenhouse gas methane, arising from fossil fuel production and agriculture, is now the big “no no” in the global fight against global heating. More than 110 countries backed efforts to cut levels by 30 per cent by 2030, rowing in with a US-EU pact.This was further underlined when, unexpectedly, US and China, pushed aside differences on other issues and announced a plan to work together on climate action over the next decade, backed by tangible rapport in Glasgow between John Kerry and lead China negotiator Xie Zhenhua. High up on their action list was methane. This is because cutting levels ensures the quickest win in cooling global temperatures.Unprecedented public engagement: There is no question mobilisation of civil society is at unprecedented level across that world. That was in evidence in Glasgow despite blatant exclusion of campaigners corralling many activists away from the venue, Covid preventing many from poorer countries attending, staggering costs for most attending the summit, and it feeling “a bit too white and elite” on the inside – amid heavy security at every access point.Stress of climate activism builds relentlessly: But there is a concerning trend evident among young climate activists who attended Cop26. They carry a heavy burden of worry. Many feel acute eco-anxiety and are up front about it. The issue dominates their lives when they should be getting on with living and pursuing life’s voyages of discovery.Unquestionably, this is compounded by their voices not being heard sufficiently they in turn are given token access to negotiations when they have a justifiable case to be at the table.As Elders chair Mary Robinson noted, when Greta Thunberg uses language like blah, blah, blah, “they say ‘is that all there is?” – when they deserve action and assurance this is not the case. Another young Irish climate justice campaigner, Valery Molay, questioned if it was worth coming to Cops any more – yet this is the only available multilateral mechanism the world has got for climate action.Global efforts will not get on the right track without their full participation, and politicians will fail the “providing a just transition” test unless they broaden their narrow mindset on this issue.Big Oil has not gone away: The world is finally beginning to decarbonise and coal is on course for phase out but the fossil fuel sector was all too evident. The NGO Global Witness established at least 503 fossil fuel lobbyists, affiliated with some of the world’s biggest oil and gas giants, were granted access to Cop26, “flooding the Glasgow conference with corporate influence”.In concert with big oil producer countries –\u0026nbspnotably Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Russia - their fingerprint was evident with weakening of the draft text, which finally came down on “accelerating phase-down of coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. Some developing countries claimed it provides loop holes allowing them to continue their polluting activities – in spite of being the single biggest source of emissions.The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance may be only a coalition of less than 10 countries (including Ireland) but it marks a shift in approach by countries committed to greater ambition, and put down a big marker for change. It intends to build to a point where turning off the fossil fuel tap is central to global climate agreements with firmer timelines – as opposed the failed approach of trying to limit oil and gas emissions.Boris on the global stage: With typical unbridled enthusiasm UK prime minister Boris Johnson tried to persuade world leaders to take action on “coal, cars, cash and trees” in advance of Cop26. His keynote address won some plaudits, though his comparing the climate crisis to James Bond being strapped to a doomsday device was greeted with some headscratching.A Daily Mirror opinion piece had the headline: “Boris more Johnny English than James Bond as hypocrisy turns Cop26 moment into farce”.As he had a dinner with chums to attend in a posh London club, he jumped on a private jet and flew home belching out 1,000kg of CO2, when the train would have emitted just 20kg. He returned the following week trying to knock heads together in seeking greater urgency his press conference was dominated by the sleaze controversy.A lesson in effective diplomacy was provided by Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon in spite of her country not being an official party at the summit. She committed £1 million to a loss and damage effort to help developing countries, and was a strong fringe presence throughout. She doubled that funding by the finish, while winning plaudits for Scotland coherence on climate action.The country running the talks, the UK, cut overseas aid just before Glasgow, which did little to build trust with vulnerable countries already suffering due to global heating, though Cop26 president Alok Sharma did much to restore relationships.Capitalism’s big pivot: This was the Cop where the financial world was finally seen to be gearing up for a net-zero world, and it will be backed up for availability of private funds. Some insisted the vast sums about to be unleashed add up to complete reorientation of capitalism.The big announcement on this front was $130 trillion “of capital committed to net zero” by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a group of 450 banks, fund managers and insurers led by UN climate envoy Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England.“The implication of this number is that finance is greening the world,” one sceptical banker told the FT. Reality is the transition will require huge state intervention backed by private sector money. The risk for GFANZ is that having overpromised, private finance will under deliver.Mr Carney has defended the extent of commitments and structure for delivery over the coming decades. “People will no longer tolerate worthy statements followed by futile gestures. They won’t settle for governments making announcements at summits that they don’t meet at home, or companies that speak green but don’t act. That’s why we’ve worked to transform the heart of finance,” he added.Urgency gap is glaring: This was supposed to be the Cop of “no more soundbytes, no more empty promises, no more blah, blah, blah”. It may not have lived up to that billing but neither was it “a greenwashing festival” dominated by the Global North, as Thunberg claimed.There was repeated endorsements of the climate emergency but a glaring lack of translating that into the level of urgency now required to have a better chance of avoid catastrophic climate change.The testimonies from countries in the frontline were truly harrowing as many face a future where “there is no high ground”. They are experiencing merciless sea-level rise with the risk that their countries will disappear and their citizens will become refugees.“You might as well bomb us,” declared Surangel Whipps Jr, president of Palau, an archipelago of over 500 islands in the western Pacific, speaking of the pain in watching his country suffer “a slow and painful death”."},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 everyone looks seven years older than they did at the beginning","story":"In the penultimate day of Cop26 nerves are rising among activists and delegates at what will be left in or out of the final document.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdJournalists work inside the media centre at the Cop26 conference, in Glasgow. Photograph:  Oli ScarffAFP via Getty ImagesAt the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow, blah blah blah is everywhere. It’s on protesters’ banners and placards outside the conference centre and on the lips of everyone inside, from Mary Robinson to Boris Johnson.But could Greta Thunberg be wrong? Could these five-yearly festivals of disappointment, where agreements fall short both in ambition and execution, still be the world’s best hope of avoiding climate catastrophe?“Build back better. Blah, blah, blah. Green economy. Blah blah blah. Net zero by 2050. Blah, blah, blah,” Thunberg told a youth climate summit in Milan in September.“This is all we hear from our so-called leaders: words. Words that sound great but so far have not led to action. Our hopes and ambitions drown in their empty promises. Of course we need constructive dialogue, but they have now had 30 years of blah, blah blah. And where has this led us?”At a demonstration in Glasgow last week, she said that change would not come from inside the conference centre and that it was on the streets that real leadership was to be found.“We say no more blah blah blah, no more exploitation of people and nature and the planet. No more exploitation. No more blah blah blah. No more whatever the f*** they are doing inside there,” she said.It’s not easy, even from inside the conference centre, to work out “whatever the f*** they are doing” and the most important meetings happen behind closed doors and beyond deepening layers of security. The venue itself is a study in alienation, so vast that one German journalist noted that his daily step count was higher than during a walking holiday in the summer.Social distancing and hygiene measures that are a throwback to the early months of the coronavirus pandemic add to the atmosphere of discomfort and awkwardness. A shortage of chairs and desks sees delegates, activists and reporters sitting on the floor of cold, hangar-like spaces, or perched on the sides of tables as they peer into their laptops.By the end of the second week, everyone looks seven years older than they did at the beginning, nobody has tasted a fresh vegetable since October and the mood has curdled. Billboards around the conference centre show images of pristine snow or solar panels with the single word “now”, which is precisely when most of the people who pass them would like to go home.Those billboards capture something of the curious spirit of climate negotiations, which are dominated by abstract language even as they focus on concrete actions to prevent real catastrophe. Ask one of the participants what they hope the conference will produce and they will say something like “solidarity, credibility and ambition”.Key concepts such as mitigation (reducing greenhouse gases), adaptation (making infrastructure more resilient to the impact of climate change) and loss and damage (compensation for damage caused by climate-related events such as storms and flooding) remain obscure to most outsiders. Even the central goal of “keeping 1.5 alive” is little understood (it means ensuring that the global temperature does not rise by more than 1.5 degrees compared with the middle of the 19th century).There is no established rule for how decisions are made at climate conferences but the practice is that they are taken by consensus, which means that the pace can be set by the least willing. The British presidency of Cop26 sought to circumvent this by starting the conference with a series of multinational announcements on forests, methane emissions and finance.But after the leaders left Glasgow early last week and the negotiations moved into a more technical phase, the initial mood of confidence gave way first to frustration and later to pessimism. It was clear by the middle of this week that the summit’s participants would not be able to agree on commitments that would bring them anywhere close to 1.5 degrees and attention turned to securing an agreement to meet again in a year or two with improved offers of action at a national level.Meanwhile, scientific experts and climate activists have pointed out that there is less to some of the summit’s most high-profile announcements than meets the eye. A commitment to end deforestation by 2030 restates a goal first identified at a summit in 2014, a methane emissions pledge was already announced two months ago and state-controlled companies such as Coal India and Saudi Aramco could evade curbs on coal and oil.But this year’s deforestation pledge is different because big players such as Brazil and Indonesia have signed up to it, and the initiative on methane backed by the US and the European Union has the support of more than 100 countries. Separately, the US and China – the world’s two biggest carbon emitters – have agreed to co-operate on “concrete and pragmatic” regulations to decarbonise, cut methane emissions and fight deforestation.The issue of carbon trading, which allows companies or states to buy and sell credits to emit carbon dioxide remains controversial, with developing countries especially sceptical about its impact and concerned that it could see a land grab by rich countries seeking to plant forests in poor countries to offset their emissions. As it entered its final hours, Cop26 looked unlikely to resolve disagreements over how a carbon trading system should work but the summit saw other initiatives to direct financial markets away from fossil fuels and towards clean technology.The issue of finance has been the most difficult and perhaps the most important, as poor countries struggle to fund the changes they need to manage the impact of climate change and reduce emissions. Rich countries have struggled to reach a target of pledging $100 billion a year in climate finance, which is itself universally recognised as inadequate.Like all its predecessors, Cop26 will be a disappointment, delivering too little too slowly and with inadequate mechanisms to guarantee that promises are kept. But if today’s situation is compared with that in Paris six years ago rather than with an ideal scenario, there are grounds for modest optimism.It was pressure from small island states in Paris that pushed the industrialised countries to consider shifting their goal from 2 degrees to 1.5 degrees. In Glasgow, the more ambitious goal has been at the centre of the negotiations and it is accepted by most participants as essential.Emissions have been falling in some developed countries, even if they continue to rise elsewhere and China’s will continue to increase for a number of years before peaking by 2030. National plans to cut emissions may not go far enough but they are more ambitious than before and many, such as Ireland’s, are enshrined in law.Among the most important changes has been in the attitude of the financial sector, which will not only make financing harmful industries more difficult and expensive but demonstrates that the world of finance recognises the political imperative of dealing with climate change.What has happened since Paris and been accelerated in Glasgow is nothing less than a reorientation of global capitalism towards a carbon neutral future. Economic actors led by the US, China and the EU will make the shift in different ways and at a different pace but the change of direction and increase of urgency are unmistakable. And that amounts to more than blah blah blah."},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 negotiators agree to strengthen emission targets by end of 2022","story":"Almost 200 countries have agreed a pact to tackle climate change, despite disagreements over phasing out fossil fuels and financial help for poorer countries. Cop26 president Alok Sharma brought the gavel down on a two-week conference in Glasgow after delegates agreed on a text more than 24 hours later than scheduled.In a historic move, fossil fuels feature for the first time in a final Cop decision by way of a call for “accelerating efforts towards the phase down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. In a dramatic move in the closing minutes of the meeting, India proposed a change to the language, replacing the words “phase out” with “phase down”.Mr Sharma appeared close to tears as he apologised for the way the process had unfolded, saying he was “deeply sorry” but he called on delegates to accept the change and approve the text.“I understand the deep disappointment but it’s vital that we protect this package,” he said to applause.The European Union expressed disappointment at the change, warning that it should not mean that it will take longer to exit from coal. But European Commission vice president Frans Timmermans said that should not stop the conference from endorsing what he described as a historic agreement.Representatives from Fiji and the Marshall Islands also protested against the last-minute change but said they would accept the agreement because it included measures their people needed.CutsThe deal, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, recognises the need for deep emissions cuts this decade in an effort to contain global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees – though commitments made before Cop26 and during the summit have come up short of delivering this.As a consequence, the decision requests countries revisit the targets “as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022, taking into account different national circumstances” – and in particular to strengthen 2030 targets next year.In the final hours of negotiation, developing countries – representing over 6 billion people – pushed for a “loss and damage” finance facility to build back in the aftermath of extreme weather events linked to climate change though there is no financing mechanism secured. This was blocked by wealthy countries though they agreed to limited funding for technical assistance and a “dialogue”.For the first time, a goal for adaptation finance was agreed – which was strongly backed by Ireland during negotiations. The commitment to double funding is below what developing countries asked for and need, but if realised it will increase support to developing countries by billions, according to negotiators.Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan welcomed the agreement as a compromise that kept the goal of 1.5C alive.“What the world has done today is to keep 1.5 alive, recommitting to keep the global temperature increase at a level that is liveable for humanity. We can only do that by delivering, including keeping our promises in Ireland to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half this decade and to reach net zero by 2050. However it is deeply disappointing that the proposal to phase out unabated coal and inefficent fossil fuel subsidies has been watered down as part of the compromise needed to agree a deal,” he said.“We also have to deliver on climate justice by seriously addressing loss and damage in countries worst affected – something Ireland is working to progress. Glasgow has injected fresh momentum in the fight against climate change. We now have to go home and prove it will result in real action that protects people and the planet, and provide a just transition and a better economy for all.”WeakJennifer Morgan of Greenpeace International said the declaration was weak, and the 1.5-degree goal “is only just alive”.Cop26 saw progress on adaptation, with the developed countries finally beginning to respond to the calls of developing countries for funding and resources to cope with rising temperatures, she acknowledged.“There was a recognition that vulnerable countries are suffering real loss and damage from the climate crisis now, but what was promised was nothing close to what’s needed on the ground. This issue must be at the top of the agenda for developed countries as the Cop goes to Egypt next year,” Ms Morgan said.The line on phasing out unabated coal and fossil fuel subsidies “is weak and compromised but its very existence is nevertheless a breakthrough, and the focus on a just transition is essential”, she believed.The call for emissions reductions of 45 per cent by the end of this decade “is in line with what we need to do to stay under 1.5 degree and brings the science firmly into this deal. But it needs to be implemented,” Ms Morgan said.On carbon market issues, she said: “The offsets scam got a boost in Glasgow with the creation of new loopholes that are too big to tolerate, endangering nature, Indigenous Peoples and the 1.5-degree goal itself. The UN Secretary General announced that a group of experts will bring vital scrutiny to offset markets, but much work still needs to be done to stop the greenwashing, cheating and loopholes giving big emitters and corporations a pass.”On the outcome Oxfam International director Gabriela Bucher said: “Clearly some world leaders think they aren’t living on the same planet as the rest of us. It seems no amount of fires, rising sea levels or droughts will bring them to their senses to stop increasing emissions at the expense of humanity.”She accepted the request to strengthen 2030 reduction targets by next year was an important step. “The work starts now. Big emitters, especially rich countries, must heed the call and align their targets to give us the best possible chance of keeping 1.5 degrees within reach. Despite years of talks, emissions continue to rise, and we are dangerously close to losing this race against time.”Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said: “In the last fortnight, the climate justice movement that came out in force in Glasgow and around the world became mainstream. We showed that you can’t tackle climate change without a radical transformation of the global economy and reparations from those who fuelled climate change to those facing its worst impacts. But this hollowed-out agreement shows that, for all the lip service they paid, world leaders and big business have not listened.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 new draft deal weakens wording on phase out of fossil fuels","story":"In the penultimate day of Cop26 nerves are rising among activists and delegates at what will be left in or out of the final document.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdProtesters move through the restricted Blue Zone area of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow on Friday. Photograph: Jane BarlowPAThe Cop26 negotiations have generated a second draft of an agreement calling for 197 countries to submit stronger emissions-reduction plans next year – but undertakings on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsides have been weakened.The latest draft, which emerged after 7am on Friday, has raised new issues, centring around language, commitments and timings for climate action over the next decade. This suggests a difficult 24 hours ahead if a meaningful outcome is to be secured.The second version of the text includes a request that countries come back by the end of next year with revised emission-reduction targets outlined in their “national determined contributions” – this, in effect, indicates commitments made by signatory countries up to this point are insufficient to contain global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees this century.The text has been criticised for lack of detail on future payments from the rich countries that are primarily responsible for global warming to the poorer countries that will take the brunt of worsening storms, droughts and floods and rising sea levels – these are under the climate finance, adaptation and loss and damage headings.Irish climate expert and Cop veteran Prof John Sweeney told The  the latest text was “watered down terribly overnight” notably the language on fossil fuels and coal had been made ambiguous. This is backing away from a call to end all use of coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies completely in the earlier draft.Prof Sweeney said the latest version seemed like “the tail wagging the dog” and it remains to be seen if the European Union side will now come out and impose red lines in an effort to strengthen the outcome. “There is now agreement to keep 1.5 degrees alive in my view,” he added – though he welcomed a request to come back with strengthened commitments by the end of next year.‘Huge loopholes’“While the words ‘coal’ and ‘fossil fuels’ have remained in the new draft decision, huge new loopholes have been introduced that see these efforts significantly weakened,” said Murray Worthy, gas campaign leader at NGO Global Witness.He added: “The aim to phase out all fossil fuel subsidies has now been rowed back to just ‘inefficient’ subsidies – which begs the question of what an efficient use of public money to bankroll the fossil fuel industry could possibly be. This term has been used at the G7 and the G20, but never been properly defined, and leaves an enormous space for countries to claim their subsidies aren’t ‘inefficient’.”The latest draft proposal from the meeting’s chair calls on countries to accelerate “the phase-out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels”.While the chair’s proposal will undergo further negotiation at the talks, officially due to end Friday, the change in wording suggested a shift away from unconditional demands that some big fossil fuel-exporting nations have objected to.In addition, delegates and experts have expressed alarm over the chasm between carbon targets and the deep cuts necessary to limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.Current national plans would lead to 2.4 degrees of heating, according to analysis this week by Climate Action Tracker. To close that gap, the new draft text “requests” governments issue new 2030 climate plans by the end of 2022 a shift from Wednesday’s draft text which used the verb “urges”.In response to reports from negotiations that finance pledges to poorer nations made in 2009 will not be met even with an extended deadline, Global Witness’s head of forest policy Veronica Oakeshott said: “Nothing illustrates the failure of governments to align their policies and actions with the challenges of the climate crisis better than the contrast between the gaping hole in finance for the most affected countries and the massive financial flows going towards deforestation and fossil fuels.”ImprovementsThere is, nonetheless, improvements in the potential agreement on adaptation to help developing countries become more climate resilient in the face of inevitable impacts from global heating.In addition, nature’s role in reaching the 1.5-degree goal has been recognised in the UNFCCC draft text. It “recognises the interlinked global crises of climate change and bioersity loss” and “emphasises the importance of protecting, conserving and restoring nature and ecosystems to achieve the Paris Agreement climate goal”.It also recognises the importance of protecting, conserving and restoring nature to deliver crucial services that reduce vulnerability to climate impacts and support sustainable livelihoods.The text also “recognises the need to strengthen ocean-based action to tackle climate change” – an issue that had been pushed by Ireland at Cop26.“It’s significant that the new text recognises nature’s role in climate mitigation and adaptation because without nature, we can’t meet the 1.5-degree Paris Agreement target,” said John Verdieck, director of international climate policy at The Nature Conservancy.He added: “While the cover note lacks some of the forward-looking ambition we’d like to see, over the last two weeks an unprecedented level of commitments has been made to protect, restore and manage forests, plus recognise the role of indigenous people in this process.”At this point there was a need to strengthen ongoing texts for finance, transparency and markets “to help governments deliver on Cop26 promises and ensure a liveable Earth system”, Mr Verdieck suggested."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney locates psychedelic fungi in the context of culture, therapy and dangerStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"plan to deliver paris climate goals could be agreed this week cop26 hears","story":"Frans Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission, said it would be a ‘very bad signal’ if a reference to phasing out coal and fossil fuels in a draft text published on Wednesday does not survive in the summit’s final statement. Photograph: Robert PerryEPAThe rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement could be completed at the Cop26 in Glasgow this week, European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans has said.He said completing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement the goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of this week’s summit. “It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone,” he told a press conference in Glasgow. “I think there is a positive dynamic, and I see a growing sense among fellow leaders that we need to find agreement. We in the European Union continue to work to keep the momentum going and hopefully drive it to the highest possible level of ambition.” Most of the rulebook has been agreed since 2018 but a number of key issues remain unresolved, notably on the regulation of carbon markets where emissions are traded. Completing the rulebook would be a major success for Cop26, which is due to end by 6pm on Friday but Mr Timmermans warned it would be a “very bad signal” if a reference to phasing out coal and fossil fuels in a draft text published on Wednesday does not survive in the summit’s final statement . “It took the world a while to understand. I remember even some of our member-states only a couple of years ago saying coal is forever. And now every member state of European Union knows that there is no future in coal. “I think the sense of urgency has increased and the understanding that fossil fuels are part of the problem has increased. But if you remove it from the text, what is the message you’re sending then? Because the only way humanity can learn to live within planetary boundaries is if we rid ourselves of the dependency on fossil fuels that are making our survival impossible,” he said. The EU has faced charges of hypocrisy over its investment in dozens of gas infrastructure projects at the same time that it is calling in Glasgow for an end to fossil fuels. But Mr Timmermans said the EU had nothing to be ashamed of and asserted that its investment in gas infrastructure helped to prepare for a future beyond fossil fuels. “Exiting out of coal for a number of our member-states will have to happen through an intermediary phase of using natural gas to lead these countries to using fossil-free energy. That is reality. “Now, what we need to do with our investments is to make sure that the investments in the infrastructure that will be needed for natural gas are pre-fitted to also be able to carry decarbonated or green gases so that the density of different gases can be transported through this infrastructure,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"young voices among the excluded at cop26 claims irish activist","story":"Over a thousand protesters gathered at the entrance of Cop26 as the climate summit entered its final day.

Photograph: EPA Voices of young people continue to be excluded from United Nations climate summits when they should be heard in negotiation rooms, according to Valery Molay of the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI)On that basis, Cop26 was lacking something, said the NYCI climate justice officer who is among a large group of young Irish climate activists in Glasgow. “It’s the 26th Cop so at some point you have to ask yourself the question, ‘are we going to keep on coming and talking about this all the time?’ ” she asked.It had been established that global warming was a systemic problem. But when young activists came to Cop26 solutions were still being considered in the framework of business as usual, said Ms Molay. “So where are the justice and equity elements in that?” she asked.Personally, she found it upsetting that the EU bloc in talking about “loss and damage”, and increasing adaptation targets, was doing so within a framework of charity. She added: “Is it charity or reparation that we are talking out?”To solve the climate crisis was not just about cutting greenhouse gases, she said. “It must be while changing the system that created the problem in the first place.” The Irish activists had an hour-long meeting with Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan in Glasgow, where she said the exclusion issue was highlighted, whereby young people could not get into the negotiation room or hear what was going on.Ms Molay said it was emotional for her hearing from people at the meeting talking about themselves and how overwhelming the climate issue was, as indicated by one person saying, “I started this at 13, now I’m going to college, I can’t continue doing this”.“They are sick and tired of assemblies and then nothing happens after that,” she noted.‘At home in Ireland’She welcomed a commitment by Mr Ryan to raise the issue of appropriate language with lead negotiators on loss and damage and his undertaking to examine how youth engagement can be improved “at home in Ireland”.The young climate activists met chairwoman of the Elders Mary Robinson at the conclusion the meeting. The former president said she was glad to have met them as well as other young people form every continent during Cop26.“Every single one them said they’re so tired they’re exhausted. We talked about their self-care,” said Mrs Robinson. Others must prove this is not the case, she insisted. Mrs Robinson introduced the Irish group to former UK prime minister Gordon Brown who was at Cop26 to make a “final push” for countries to agree on $100 billion (€87 billion) a year for poorer countries to tackle climate disruption, to avoid the summit being branded a failure.

Photograph: Oliver McVeighPA WireIn the bright winter sunshine, the people of Edendork waited to welcome Austin Currie home.They stood on the pavements, and clustered outside the entrance to the chapel among them were the Primate of All Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, SDLP politicians past and present, representatives of the GAA in Tyrone - including the chairman, Michael Kerr -and, above all, local people, neighbours and friends of the extended Currie family.This was Mr Currie’s homeplace he had been baptised in this church, and in his homily Dean Kevin Donaghy recalled meeting him at the annual Blessing of the Graves, which he “never missed.”“He and I had a short, final conversation together and he expressed his hope and desire that when his own time would come his resting place would be Edendork. Today, his wish his granted.”“He never lost his sense of who he was and where he was from,” Archbishop Martin told The . “We were blessed to have people of calibre to lead us and show us the way.”Requiem Mass for Mr Currie had been celebrated in Allenwood, Co Kildare on Friday – attended by, among others, the President and Government ministers – ahead of his final journey home for burial at St Malachy’s on Saturday.As they awaited the arrival of the cortege, three political opponents stood chatting at the church gates – the Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, former Ulster Unionist MP and member of the House of Lords, Ken Maginnis, and the former SDLP MP Alasdair McDonnell.MarchBoth Mr Molloy and Mr Currie had been there at the start both had marched on the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in August 1968.“He was one of the ones that stood up the very start,” said Mr Molloy. “We probably disagreed on most things, but I admired that he did stand up ... it was high risk, all of it, it was unknown territory, but he had the courage to do it.”“Austin and I were very close,” said Mr Maginnis. “When the civil rights movement started I was at the first few meetings with Austin – he invited me along - and we had the same mind on the unfairness of housing allocation.“Austin was the fairest-minded man that I ever knew and ever worked with, and we were always able to work together. He had an eye to the future and could see beyond differences and knew what was important - housing and jobs.”“He was a political colossus but he was also a friend of mine since the early 1970s, and I admired him,” said Mr McDonnell.“My son, who is a history buff, says he was the Rosa Parks of the civil rights movement, because he was the guy that had the courage to do things that were dangerous.“He was always there for people – and he paid a high price – but he never put his own interests first.”As the cortege made its way towards the church, preceded a piper and accompanied by a guard of honour from the local GAA club, its route echoed that of the first civil rights march.Members of the SDLP unfurled a civil rights banner and stood guard behind it as the coffin - covered in the Tricolour that was his due as a former Minister of State - was removed from the hearse and carried up the hill into the church.“He fought the good fight for justice and equality and for peace in a long an exemplary political life,” Dean Donaghy told mourners.His family – his wife Annita and their five children and 13 grandchildren – were at the heart of the service his daughter Estelle read a tribute on behalf of the family, and the gifts – including a poster for the civil rights march in Duke Street in Derry in 1969, Edendork and Tyrone GAA jerseys, a copy of his autobiography and a tv remote - were brought up by his grandchildren.SharedIn a special reading on behalf of her mother, his daughter Emer shared the words her parents would say to affirm their love for each other.Yet for all his achievements – not least as the only person to have served in government both North and South – Mr Currie’s greatest legacy, said SDLP veteran Joe Hendron, will always remain the sit-in in Caledon, Co Tyrone in June 1968, which drew national attention to housing discrimination and, it is argued, sparked the civil rights movement.“Even if he had never done anything else but that .... that was fantastic,” he said.Today, more than 50 years on from the beginning of the civil rights movement, many reflected that this was the “end of an era” the last time they had seen Mr Currie was at the funeral of Pat Hume last September, who herself had been predeceased by her husband John, by Ivan Cooper and by others whose names will be forever associated with the civil rights movement.Among the mourners, a few wore pins bearing the civil rights logo – an oak leaf in black and white – on their lapels in tribute the civil rights anthem, We Shall Overcome, played as Mr Currie’s remains were carried from the church.He was buried beside his parents, Johnny and Minnie Austin Currie, the son of Edendork, had finally come home."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Saint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"apostrophe marked extinction language becomes less formal","story":"There are few grammatical constructs that stir as much passion as the apostrophe. But language traditionalists will be saddened to hear that the punctuation mark could soon be a thing of the past.There has been a noticeable decline in its use, according to the largest ever study of how spoken and written language has evolved over the past three decades.Researchers from Lancaster University have amassed a database of 100 million words that they have used to analyse trends from the early Nineties to the present.“The most striking thing you can see is how informal language has become,” said Dr Vaclav Brezina who led the study. “There has been a systematic shift not only towards more informal vocabulary but also towards more informal grammar.”Dr Brezina, an expert in linguistics, said this was one of the more surprising findings, since normally grammar is more resistant to changes over time.“There has been a very noticeable drop in the use of apostrophes,” he said, explaining that this was a change that had been prompted by the increasing use of social media platforms, where they were often dropped for brevity and speed.“We still maintain some editorial standards - newspapers and academic journals would have some processes to keep them in place and they are part of our perceived standards. We can see the emergence of dropping apostrophes on social media, but the question is how much more time will it take for this to extend to elsewhere?”Academics used their corpus - which is the largest balanced and structured sample of the English language - to analyse how many times per million a particular word was used in the early Nineties compared to now.They found that there has been an eight per cent decrease in the uses where the apostrophe is used after a plural noun - such as birds’ beaks - from 308.47 uses per million in the Nineties to 282.88 uses per million in present day English.Formal research reports today include almost twice as many informal expressions such as “it’s” instead of “it is” than a research report in the early Nineties.Dr Brezina told The  that modal verbs such as shall, must and may are declining “dramatically”, adding: “This started in the first half of the twentieth century. We still use them now, but with significantly decreased frequency.”“Shall”, “must” and “may” have decreased by 60 per cent, 40 per cent and 41 per cent respectively, while “whom” has decreased by 52 per cent, researchers found.Another example of the trend towards more informal language was the decreasing use of formal terms of address such as Mr and Mrs, which have decreased by 35 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively.“We might be more likely to use first names now in official letters or sources of communications,” Dr Brezina said. “All these things tell a story not only about language but also our society.”Meanwhile, there has also been a “significant increase” in the use of the exclamation mark since the 1990s, the research showed. Although this did not break any grammatical rules, traditionalists may see it as an “overuse”, Dr Brezina said.There has also been a major increase in the use of formerly frowned upon linguistic features such as the split infinitive. English speakers are now three times more likely to use a phrase such as “to gradually bring” or “to effectively tell” both in speech and writing than they were in the early 1990s.The database uses balanced samples of written and spoken language from a range of different samples including newspapers, magazines, television shows, works of fiction, social media, blog posts, academic journals and political speeches.Dr Brezina explained that social media has had a big influence on the evolution of the English language, both in terms of grammar - such as the dropping of the apostrophe - but also in terms of words.Social media influences language more generally and the words that originate in social media get picked up in other registrars,” he said. “You have a selection of words that are strikingly different when we compare the old and new datasets. These come from social media in particular, where the medium itself forces the language.”New words and expressions related to technology - such as vlog, fitbit and bitcoin - have come into existence, while shorthands such as “omg” (oh my god), “tbh” (to be honest) and “defo” (definitely) have come into common parlance.The word “amazing” has increased in use five-fold from 16.6 times per million to 88.6 times per million, while the use of “maybe” has almost tripled from 89.3 to 236.1 parts per million.More from NewsPrince Charles releases new portrait to mark 73rd birthdayExclusive: Liz Truss tells Vladimir Putin to end ‘shameful’ migrant crisisWe must stand together for freedom and democracySenior members of Royal family honour the fallen at Festival of RemembranceAnger over taxpayers’ money sent to China to fund ‘cruel’ battery chicken farmsSajid Javid hires \u0026#39war room\u0026#39 tsar to tackle NHS backlogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris needs wake late","story":"Boris, I love you, but you’ve got to change direction. Our 55th PM was elected because he was unusually popular with the public, embodied Brexit and was bigger than his party. Some MPs dislike him the membership is increasingly suspicious. The party took a chance on Boris because he alone could break the red wall, hence the relationship is contractual.But suddenly Labour leads the Tories (by as much as six points in one poll), breaking a two year Conservative advantage. It’s not just a short-term reaction to the Owen Paterson saga at least as important is the way No10 handled the scandal, coming to the aid of a mate and signalling that Britain’s brief experiment in ruthless populism is over. Boris won in 2019 much the way he stole his party, by promising to give voters exactly what they want – the elites could go hang. Now, the elites are back in charge.It hasn’t helped that while Westminster debates the influence of big money, Boris has been lost in Glasgow with Joe Biden and Leonardo DiCaprio. It’s like skipping PMQs to attend the Oscars. British voters certainly care about the climate Boris’s leadership has been excellent and appreciated. But every promise to regulate, wind-down, subsidise and compensate is bankrolled by the public, first through taxes and second through prices, both of which are already on the up. My own electricity bill has doubled before I’ve even put the electric blanket on. The polls are going to get worse. Starting with me.Wages might be rising but so are costs (particularly housing), and millions will soon be hit by a National Insurance hike, fiscal drag and, it’s rumoured, a crafty tweak to student loans. Council taxes are bound to go the same way, too.The public is sold this bill on the grounds that healthcare needs funds, and this is one area where the Government is happy to follow the polls. But more money won’t prevent the annual NHS winter crisis or the waiting-list nightmare. When you mix in the possibility of energy shortages, we are going to spend a miserable New Year paying more cash for worse services, all the while that actors and bankers (a dangerous axis of beauty and brains) insist it’s for our own good. One gets the impression that economic policy is being dictated more by schoolchildren than the parents who clothe, feed and educate them.Boris needs to get back to what the adults want. Not all them: the country is ided (quite a few seem to actively dislike it), and the PM will never speak for everyone. But the 44 per cent who voted Tory two years ago are likely to want to see activists who block roads moved on illegal immigration ended woke confronted a green strategy that helps consumers rather than harms them and a reduction in taxes.Hitherto, Boris has coasted on charisma buoyed by Brexit, lockdown solidarity and general joy at the vaccine roll out. But these issues are passing. What one is left with is a small record, big u-turns, accusations of cronyism and the same cultural elitism that Brexit was supposed to exorcise. If the public does get tired of Boris personally, a majority built on so little is bound to collapse.More from NewsPrince Charles releases new portrait to mark 73rd birthdayExclusive: Liz Truss tells Vladimir Putin to end ‘shameful’ migrant crisisWe must stand together for freedom and democracySenior members of Royal family honour the fallen at Festival of RemembranceAnger over taxpayers’ money sent to China to fund ‘cruel’ battery chicken farmsSajid Javid hires \u0026#39war room\u0026#39 tsar to tackle NHS backlogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bravest vc","story":"In a quiet corner of Twickenham Cemetery, south-west London, beneath the outstretched branches of a gnarled cherry tree, there is a black marble tombstone. “Cherished memories of a dearly loved husband, father and grandfather,” reads the inscription.However, it is two letters after the name of the inidual that makes this grave so different from the others: “V.C.”, standing for Victoria Cross, Britain and the Commonwealth’s most prestigious decoration for gallantry in the presence of the enemy.This is the grave of Warrant Officer Norman Jackson VC as someone with a lifelong interest in bravery, I am the privileged custodian of the Jackson medal group. It is part of my VC collection – more than 200 strong and the largest in the world – that is on public display in the Imperial War Museum, London.Yet there is no single VC action that I admire more than the one carried out by Jackson during a bombing mission in the spring of 1944. Nearly 80 years on, the selfless act of valour that Jackson performed still seems impossible to comprehend.Norman Cyril Jackson was born in Ealing, west London, on April 8, 1919 and within months he had been adopted. After attending schools in Twickenham, he became a fitter and turner.On October 20, 1939, less than two months after the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve, initially working as ground crew, then becoming a flight engineer.In July 1943, and by then a sergeant, he joined 106 Squadron at Syerston, Nottinghamshire, and completed around a dozen sorties before the squadron moved to RAF Metheringham, Lincolnshire, in early November.By April 24, 1944, Jackson had completed his scheduled tour of 30 operations, mostly over heavily-defended German targets. However, before taking some time off, he volunteered for one more sortie on the night of April 267 because the rest of the crew were one mission behind him. The target that night for the Lancaster crew was Schweinfurt, which was at the centre of the German ball-bearing industry.The Lancaster’s bombs were dropped successfully and the aircraft was climbing out of the target area when, suddenly, it was attacked by a night fighter at nearly 20,000 feet.The captain took evading action at once, but the enemy Focke-Wulfe 190 secured several hits. A fire started near a petrol tank on the upper surface of the aircraft’s starboard wing.Sergeant Jackson had been thrown to the floor during the attack and he was also wounded by shell splinters in his right leg and shoulder. Recovering his composure, he obtained his captain’s permission to try to put out the flames.Pushing a small fire extinguisher into the top of his flying jacket and grabbing small axe, he jettisoned the escape hatch. He then started to climb out in order to reach the burning wing.With the Lancaster travelling at 200 mph, he released his parachute inside the aircraft. This enabled other crew to hold on to the rigging lines, paying them out as Jackson crawled into the unknown. As he inched his way towards the fire, he slipped and grasped on to the leading edge of the starboard wing.Using the axe to secure a grip, he fought the blaze with the extinguisher. Despite his best efforts, the fire spread and soon his face, hands and clothing were severely burnt. Even worse, the enemy fighter came back and strafed the Lancaster a second time, forcing Jackson to drop the fire extinguisher. Unable to keep his hold on, Jackson was swept through the flames and into the night.When last seen falling towards the ground, his parachute was only partly inflated and was burning in a number of places. Jackson, with his parachute ablaze, was unable to control his descent and landed heavily. He suffered a broken ankle, his right eye was closed and his hands were burnt so badly as to render them useless.At daybreak, he crawled to the nearest village on his knees and elbows because his hands were such a mess. Once the German authorities were alerted to his presence, he was taken as a Prisoner of War and transported to Dulag Luft, a prison camp that acted as collection and interrogation centre for newly-captured Allied aircrew before they were transferred to more permanent camps.However, due to his 17 separate injuries, Jackson spent his first ten months in hospital before being imprisoned with other POWs. During his captivity, he made two escape attempts, the second, close to the end of the war in Europe, was successful. He met up with troops from General Patton’s Third Army near Munich.Jackson eventually learned that four others from the seven Lancaster crew had survived the attack. After the war he was reunited with his wife Alma, whom he had married in London on Boxing Day 1942. They eventually had seven children, four sons and three daughters.As the full story of Jackson’s courage emerged, he was recommended for the VC. His decoration was announced in The London Gazette on October 26, 1945 when his citation ended, “By his ready willingness to face these dangers he set an example of self-sacrifice which will ever be remembered.”Jackson returned to Britain on VE Day and received his VC at Buckingham Palace from George VI on November 13, 1945.  He retired in the rank of warrant officer with a disability pension and was always modest about his wartime role, once saying of his VC action: “I was the most experienced member of the crew, and they all looked to me to do something.”He worked as a travelling salesman for Haig whisky after the war, and died at Hampton Hill, Middlesex, on March 26, 1994, aged 74.Jackson’s VC was auctioned in London in 2004 at the request of his family. The medal group fetched a hammer price of £200,000, plus auctioneer’s commission. At the time, this was the highest auction price ever paid for a VC but one that reflected the incredible story behind the award.Furthermore, it was because of brave men like Norman Jackson that, more than a decade ago, I pledged £1million towards a £6.7million fund to build a permanent Bomber Command Memorial in London’s Green Park. This was built and unveiled by the Queen in the summer of 2012.Earlier this week, I visited Twickenham Cemetery to pay my respects to Jackson at his graveside and to meet one of his five surviving children. David Jackson, 68, a semi-retired businessman, told me: “Dad was a wonderful man with a great sense of humour. He was humble and rarely discussed his VC action but there is no doubt that the bravery he showed was simply incredible.”This week, as we commemorate our war dead, my thoughts have turned again and again to Norman Jackson VC, a man whose courage and self-sacrifice must never be forgotten and who, arguably, carried out the greatest VC action of all time.Lord Ashcroft KCMG PC is a businessman, philanthropist, author and pollster.

Only Streatham South saw a decrease from 16 to 13 applications, with Knight’s Hill remaining unchanged at 11 permits for both 2019 and 2020.In 2020, 43,090 permits were actually issued by the council, an 11.9 per cent increase on 2019, when 38,510 were distributed to residents and businesses. Annual parking permits cost between £38 and £324.50 in Lambeth.A spokeswoman for One Lambeth, which is opposed to the LTNs, said: The premise of LTNs, as stated by both Lambeth Council and the Department for Transport, was to encourage a \u0027modal shift\u0027 away from cars to walking and cycling.“This data proves the schemes do no such thing, instead in Lambeth it has increased the numbers of cars. Worse still, it means the borough is going in the opposite direction to the rest of London and the country where car use over the same period is in decline.“The council, encouraged by Grant Shapps, has been rolling out LTNs under the auspices of a \u0027climate emergency\u0027 claiming that the reduction in pandemic traffic was a means to encourage people out of their cars.“In fact, more people are driving and LTNs have contributed to worsening congestion and pollution on surrounding roads. The irony is that this is a Labour council embracing a Tory policy.A Lambeth Council spokesman said: “Less dependence on motor vehicle use means we can reduce air pollution and improve air quality. The need for urgent action was clear at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but it has been underlined in recent days by the warnings about the climate emergency, coming from Cop26, the annual UN climate conference.“There is no evidence to suggest that LTNs, established to help reduce traffic, improve road safety and enable active travel such as walking or cycling, have contributed to an increase in parking permits.We believe the number of permits issued increased for a number of reasons – including the introduction of Estate Permits into our system in 2020, and also a temporary shift in citizens moving to vehicles during the pandemic because of the restrictions and confidence in public transport. A new controlled parking zone in Streatham Hill and the extension of part of the Tulse Hill scheme on their own accounted for a 2.4 per cent increase.”More from NewsPrince Charles releases new portrait to mark 73rd birthdayExclusive: Liz Truss tells Vladimir Putin to end ‘shameful’ migrant crisisWe must stand together for freedom and democracySenior members of Royal family honour the fallen at Festival of RemembranceAnger over taxpayers’ money sent to China to fund ‘cruel’ battery chicken farmsSajid Javid hires \u0026#39war room\u0026#39 tsar to tackle NHS backlogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must stand together freedom democracy","story":"We believe in freedom and democracy. Freedom-loving societies are not just the best places to live, they are the most successful. When the Berlin Wall fell and the Iron Curtain came crashing down three decades ago, renewed democracies were established across eastern Europe. People have become freer, living better lives and their children have better futures. But these hard-won gains are now at risk with malign, autocratic regimes seeking to take away people’s freedom.Look at what’s happening in Belarus. The escalating stand-off at the Polish border marks the latest step by the Lukashenko regime to undermine regional security. He is using desperate migrants as pawns in his bid to create instability and cling on to power, regardless of the human cost.The United Kingdom will not look away. We will stand with our allies in the region, who are on the frontier of freedom. That’s why we are proud to be the first European country to assist Poland by agreeing to send a small team of personnel to provide engineering support to ease pressure at the border.In the same way, we were the first European country to put sanctions on the Lukashenko regime, targeting more than 100 iniduals and organisations with measures including asset freezes and travel bans. This shows we are ready to take the lead in standing up for freedom and democracy, acting robustly, decisively and relentlessly to take on malign actors wherever they are in the world.We are not just standing side by side with Poland as it bears the brunt of this shameful manufactured migrant crisis, but also the others in the Visegrad Four – Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – and our friends in the Baltics and Ukraine.In Belarus, this carefully crafted crisis is an attempt to ert attention away from the litany of abhorrent acts and human rights violations that the regime has already committed. Since the fraudulent election in August 2020, we have seen members of the opposition, journalists and activists beaten, jailed and killed, while others have been forced into exile.In contrast to their tyrannical leaders, the people of Belarus are true democrats. We have seen ordinary citizens risking everything to stand up for their rights and keep the flame of freedom alive. As the chairman of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, Andrei Bastunets, said: “Today, the law does not defend us. Today, we defend the law.” Russia has a clear responsibility here. It must press the Belarusian authorities to end the crisis and enter into dialogue.We need to fight for the rule of law, freedom and democracy, and we must take that fight to where that ideological battle is. Security is no longer solely about military hardware. The battle is now taking place in cyberspace, the economy and in the appalling use of people as collateral.We will join forces with our partners to advance our shared interests. At the Nato foreign ministers’ summit in Riga in a few weeks’ time, we will put forward new proposals to challenge the 21st-century methods of aggression being used by those who threaten our freedoms, economies and democracies.The world is changing and modern threats are more complex. That idea lies at the heart of the Integrated Review of security, defence, development and foreign policy the Government published earlier this year. We need to work with allies who believe we must have a world where freedom-loving democracies don’t just survive, but thrive.That is why we remain the largest European spender on defence in Nato – the world’s greatest defence alliance. It is why we are working with friends and allies in south-east Asia, where we are deepening our defence, maritime and security ties. This week in Indonesia, the world’s third-largest democracy, I agreed new ties in cyber. I also visited Thailand and Malaysia, where our co-operation includes the Five Power Defence Arrangements. We are also increasing our defence collaboration with India, Israel and many others around the world. Through Aukus we are collaborating with the US and Australia on the next generation of technologies.I want our friends across Europe to join us. That means standing together, for example in opposing the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. It risks undermining European security by allowing Russia to tighten its grip on those nations who rely on its gas, despite the pandemic reminding us about the importance of having erse supply chains to avoid being strategically dependent on unreliable partners.At this critical time, we should be deepening our investment and trade ties with countries that follow the rules and allow free-market economies to thrive. We cannot, and will not, ever give succour to those who want to undermine freedom and democracy.Together with our friends and allies, we can build a network of liberty, working to repel these malign actors to ensure freedom-loving people can live in peace.More from NewsPrince Charles releases new portrait to mark 73rd birthdayExclusive: Liz Truss tells Vladimir Putin to end ‘shameful’ migrant crisisSenior members of Royal family honour the fallen at Festival of RemembranceAnger over taxpayers’ money sent to China to fund ‘cruel’ battery chicken farmsSajid Javid hires \u0026#39war room\u0026#39 tsar to tackle NHS backlogCar usage appears to increase in London borough after low traffic neighbourhoods introducedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"geoffrey cox accused feathering nest","story":"Geoffrey Cox accused of feathering his nest as voters in Torys constituency hit outConservative MP Sir Geoffrey Cox has been facing criticism over his work outside Parliament. Voters in Tavistock, in his Torridge and West Devon constituency, share their viewsFormer Attorney General Sir Geoffrey Cox Image: REUTERSByChristine Grfin:,  Nov | commentsTory MP Sir Geoffrey Cox has been under fire this week after he was accused of using his parliamentary office for his £million-a-year second job. The former Attorney General was reported to the standards watchdog when footage emerged of him appearing to use his Commons office for his work advising the Government of the British Virgin Islands on a corruption probe triggered by the UK. Sir Geoffrey, who has practised as a QC since before his election in , put out a defiant statement denying that he had broken any rules, and said he had been clear about his work as a leading barrister. In a statement, his office said: Sir Geoffrey’s view is that it is up to the electors of Torridge and West Devon whether or not they vote for someone who is a senior and distinguished professional in his field and who still practices that profession. That has been the consistent view of the local Conservative Association and although at every election his political opponents have sought to make a prominent issue of his professional practice.  It has so far been the consistent view of the voters of Torridge and West Devon. Sir Geoffrey is very content to abide by their decision. But some voters in Tavistock, a market town in his Torridge and West Devon constituency, took a dferent view. Heaposs feathering his nest Tavistock Foodbank volunteer Brian Eales said he had voted Tory in the past but he was unhappy with the party now. Mr Eales, , said: I’ve never seen Geoffrey Cox at the foodbank in support. I did see him before my father passed away at the care home. He did visit there quite a lot but that was about  years ago. He’s not been seen recently in the office he’s got in Tavistock.  We don’t know what he does with his money do we. I’d like to think that with the sort of money he’s earning he’s making good use of, but he’s not. That’s a dferent kettle of fish. I’ve voted Conservative before but at the moment I wouldn’t vote for them, no. I’d be interested to find out what he is doing with the money. At the moment it seems to be all ‘self’, feathering his own nest shall we call it  I would be hurtI was a foodbank user by the lack of empathy Suzanne Weston, another volunteer in the foodbank cafe, said she thought Sir Geoffrey should stand down. Ms Weston, , said: What’s he’s doing is disgusting, absolutely outrageous and he’s supposedly our MP. He’s earning enough money as it is, and with the best will in the world nobody can do two full-time jobs at once. He can’t be putting his constituency work first while he’s over in the Caribbean, when we’re all having to be careful over here.  “I would imagine that many of the food bank clients are pretty upset about it. If I was in the awful position of having to come to the foodbank, I would be so hurt that someone in his position was not being more empathic towards my situation, just through his practical actions. I have never voted Tory nor would I ever. Although I know that there is always something going on in government, I just think this is awful.” He may have taken a step too far Penelope Tanner, , said he should be appearing more often in his constituency. The retired former councillor said: I think Geoffrey Cox is an extremely talented professional person who may have taken a step too far, but he was asked by the Government to take up his position.  “I feel he could appear in person a bit more often in his constituency here and his work should be measured. I think the Government has lost its way… they should be setting an example to the country particularly now with Covid. He shouldnapost resign - but he has abused his position -year-old Phil Hellier said Sir Geoffrey needed to think about ordinary folk in his constituency. I don’t think he should resign, but he’s abused his position and he should be thinking about what he could be doing for the ordinary person in the street, she said.  There’s not ever a day goes by when we don’t hear something and we’re not talking about small sums of money! There are people going without and he should put his constituency first. He lives here and I have heard he’s helped with local causes and done all he can to help. I’m dumbfounded with the lot of them. Itaposs ok to do another job Farmer Steve Vincent said he would still back Sir Geoffrey. The -year-old said: “I don’t know him, but I would still support him. If he’s doing another job that’s OK as long as he’s paying his taxes, there’s no reason why not to.  Itaposs not a crime as long as he delivers what heaposs supposed to Paul Reid, , said the MP was fine to have another job as long as he was meeting his commitments. He said: “It’s not obvious that he’s broken any rules. There’s a fine line, I work from home and occasionally I’ll manage to do a few other things. It’s not a crime as long as he delivers what he’s supposed to. Assuming he’s doing everything he should do, he seems experienced in what he’s doing.”   Iaposm appalled by the situation Angela Evans, , said it was wrong for the MP to be off earning large sums of cash outside of the area. She said: “I’m personally appalled by the situation. I would not want him to be ed to office and I feel really strongly about this. In fact, we emailed his office a couple of days ago to say how wrong it is that he is over in the British Virgin Islands and that he is not giving his effort and time to his constituents.  “On the surface Tavistock is seemingly a wealthier town compared to some towns but there are signicant amounts of people who are not making ends meet, and they are working but they still cannot make ends meet and there are signicant numbers of people who are homeless, and many are ‘sofa surfing’. “I think he’s quite good at appearing benevolence in front of cameras, but I think it’s quite shallow. I feel very angry about it. It just feels wrong to me to be off earning huge amounts of money and not even in the area.

They locked lips, just as they did in the MP’s office back in June, when social distancing did not seem to be uppermost in their minds. Mr Hancock, who had presided over the Government’s shambolic handling of the pandemic, later fell on his sword and resigned. Neighbours in West Hampstead say the couple look very happy together. One said: “Wasn’t it Theresa May who said that taking the bins out was a boy’s job  Looks like Matt’s turned that on its head. “It looks like they’ve settled in pretty quickly, and they’re obviously really cosy with each other.”The pair have enjoyed two getaways in recent weeks – to the Swiss Alps and Croatia. Mr Hancock’s marriage of  years to we Martha broke down in the wake of the CCTV clinch scandal.At the time he said: “The last thing I would want is for my private le to distract attention from the single-minded focus that is leading us out of this crisis. “I reiterate my apology for breaking the guidance, and apologise to my family and loved ones for putting them through this.

Not that he would have been quids in with the UN role helping Africa’s economy recover from Covid – as it was unpaid. But it would have given him the kudos he needs to rebuild his shattered political career. The UN withdrew last month’s offer after finding an obscure rule which says sitting MPs are prohibited from the post – and Africa was spared. Now Hancock will need a few more stf drinks before the sleaze row rocking Westminster engulfs him, too. It will not be long before his own cronyism is back under the microscope. The National Audit Office said half the £billion on pandemic contracts was awarded without competitive tender. Even the MP’s local pub landlord won a deal for Covid tests. Nothing to do with me, guv, said Hancock. And he’d better get a good stock of hooch in before the public inquiry into the pandemic begins as flowers bloom next spring. He won’t come up smelling of roses. PPE shortages, the test and trace fiasco and discharging patients with Covid back into care homes are mistakes likely to be laid at his door.

It started with the Prime Minister changing the rules to save his mate. Owen Paterson has now resigned, but not before hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money was paid to Randox, the company paying Paterson to lobby the Government. The Government continued to award Randox Covid contracts after the company was forced to recall up to , test kits because they weren’t up to scratch. We need an inquiry into whether Paterson’s lobbying influenced the Government’s decision to hand over millions in public funds without tender. Paterson may be gone, but the sleaze story is going nowhere. Reports suggest one in four Tory MPs are moonlighting in second, third and even fourth jobs.  Many look to be cashing in on their connections and insights as former ministers, while others are speaking in the House of Commons on issues relating to their employers. Cash for questions is back. Now it’s emerged that a Tory MP has been taking money from a firm caught up in Chinese state-surveillance claims. Is there no opportunity to line their pockets that these Tories won’t take  It’s hard to know where to start with Geoffrey Cox, who has been heard from just twice in two years in the House of Commons.  Not only has he been doing a full-time job, earning a fortune and failing to put his constituents first, Cox has been working on behalf of a tax haven, the British Virgin Islands, facing allegations of corruption. And it appears the whole thing has been sanctioned by the Government’s Chief Whip. That Cox is working to defend a tax haven really sticks in the throat. His colleague Adam Afriyie is currently facing potential bankruptcy for unpaid taxes. Yet both MPs loyally voted through the Conservative Government’s tax increases on working families. As the revelations have unfolded, Boris Johnson looks paralysed. He won’t apologise. He has no plan to clean up politics. It’s not clear whether he understands that what his MPs have been up to is wrong. Don’t forget, he described his own outside earnings of £, a year as “chicken feed”. I had £ to my name when I was first elected to Parliament. Compare and contrast with Keir Starmer. Before he came into politics, Keir headed up the Crown Prosecution Service. He took the decision to prosecute MPs who cheated on their expenses, ensuring they faced jail time. Throughout his career, he spent much of his time doing unpaid work for causes he believed in – standing up for ordinary people against powerful interests.  And while the Prime Minister has focused on trying to get his mates off the hook, Keir has a plan to clean up our politics. Ban MPs from paid consultancies and directorships. Ban ministers from taking on lobbying gigs for five years. And set up an Office for Value for Money, to make sure that every pound of taxpayers’ money is spent wisely. I know who I trust to clean up this mess.

The former Health Secretary wants to reveal all on his aposheroicapos role in the UK vaccine campaign, as well as aposheatedapos lockdown rows with ministers, aides, scientists and medics.Mr Hancock, who the Prime Minister called aposf***ing hopelessapos during his time as Health Secretary, is said to be in talks with HarperCollins about the book, which could earn him around £,, the Daily Mail reports.Itaposs reported the book will give Mr Hancock the chance to dispute claims that he was to blame for key blunders in the pandemic, and also hit out at former No  aide Dominic Cummings, who accused him of incompetence.Mr Hancock last night told the Mail: I have been approached to write a book, but no decisions have been made. The shamed ex-Cabinet Minister is believed to want the book published just before the official Covid inquiry starts in the spring. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror  According to the Mail, Mr Hancock intends to portray himself in a aposheroic lightapos and aposget his version of events out thereapos before he faces the inquiry. The former Health Secretary was forced to resign in June for breaching his own Covid restrictions when pictures emerged of him in a clinch with adviser Gina Coladangelo.Mr Hancock’s affair was exposed after The Sun published CCTV footage from inside the Tory MP’s office, showing the couple - who have known each other since university - enjoying a steamy kiss. He faced a barrage of calls to resign, after breaching the special distancing guidelines he had helped to establish as Health Secretary, and despite having the full support of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Mr Hancock resigned just days after his affair hit the headlines. He has since left his we.According to the Mail, Mr Hancock is keen to resist pressure to use the book to describe the affair with aide Gina Coladangelo that led to his resignation in June. Instead, itaposs believed he will use the book to take aim at Mr Cummings, and elaborate on the claim that Mr Cummingsapos aposdestructive anticsapos delayed the vaccine breakthrough. Itaposs thought he will also take aim at EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen over Covid jab rows. A well-placed source told the Mail: Matt paints a picture of a man burning the midnight oil night after night, staying cool under fire, saving the NHS and rising above petty Downing Street squabbles.If you believe the book, the vaccine is all down to him for backing it against all odds, treating anti-vaxxers with contempt and winning over a sceptical public. Mr Hancock also may reportedly go out of his way to be flatteringapos about Mr Johnson in the book, which some say is a clear sign that he is determined to win back his seat at the Cabinet table. Mr Hancockaposs handling of the Covid pandemic has come under scrutiny in the past, most notably after he claimed to have thrown a protective ring around care homes, only for Covid to rip through care homes after many elderly people were discharged from hospitals to free up beds. This resulted in thousands of people dying. He was at one stage branded aposf***ing hopeless’ by the Prime Minister, while on another occasion he absurdly denied a scarcity of PPE led to anyone dying on the Covid frontline. The news of the book deal comes after Mr Hancockaposs attempt to mount a political comeback faltered when the United Nations withdrew an offer of a job as a top envoy to Africa. Mr Hancock boasted of his appointment as an unpaid “UN special representative on financial innovation and climate change” for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. But the job offer was cancelled amid a furious public backlash. It also came the same day that a highly critical joint probe by the Commons health and science committees found Mr Hancock had presided over one of the most important public health failures in UK history at the start of the pandemic. The report found ministers had made a “serious error” by taking a sluggish approach to imposing lockdowns last year. A spokesperson for Matt Hancock said: “Matt has been approached to write a book about his experiences in the pandemic, but no decisions have been made. There is no deal. The people who were heroic during the pandemic were the NHS staff who worked round the clock to save lives.” Comment MORE ON HarpercollinsBoris JohnsonPoliticsMatthew Hancock MPCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

For too long, mental health has been ignored, treated as less important than physical health. But attitudes have changed and we all realise its importance. All, it seems, except the Government. The last decade or so of Tory rule has seen mental health provision slashed to the bone. Services have gone, units closed, beds disappeared. Those in charge have been careless. It’s bad enough during normal times. But in a pandemic it’s downright dangerous.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Now the seeds they have sown are bearing fruit. Last year every hospital had , people in a mental health crisis brought to AE by ambulance. That’s a % jump since . The system couldn’t cope anyway. Now it’s breaking. Ambulances are backing up outside hospitals, waiting lists are at all-time highs, paramedics and police are struggling to cope. The solutions are clear: proper funding for health services and proper provision for mental health, a revolution in social care, better pay and conditions for our health service staff. It’s a lot, but this Government has a knack of finding money when it needs to. This isn’t for a trip to the Cayman Islands though. This is big money to save our NHS, end the mental health crisis and enable our health service do what it does best: caring for people and saving lives. Meghan court out The beauty of the justice system is that it is blind. Rich or poor, those before the courts are judged on the facts of their case and nothing more. Even Meghan Markle is finding this out now. She “forgot” certain vital information during a hearing. What’s frightening for her is that others might now remember things that were forgotten. No-one wishes her ill. She has had a tough time of it in the past couple of years. But the courts are based on a system that applies to everyone. Even a Duchess.

The undeclared income included £,. from  football matches in  and , and £, in a top-up salary from his role as an MSP.The SNP said that, since being elected, Mr Ross has missed multiple votes, important events, and parliamentary meetings at Westminster and Holyrood to earn thousands of pounds from his outside interests, including running the line on a football pitch.  SNP Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald MP said: The rule-breaking Scottish Tory leader must sht his attention from maximising his outside earnings and start focusing on his role as an MSP, which is supposed to be a full-time job. Failing to declare thousands of pounds from multiple side hustles is a clear breach of the rules but the bigger concern is that Mr Ross isnapost doing the day job. Heaposs missed crucial votes, including on Tory universal credit cuts, to rake in extra cash running the line at football matches. It is time to blow the whistle on Tory sleaze.

Ms Oswald added: By desperately clinging onto his Westminster seat, Mr Ross has scored an own goal. Voters are not impressed, and people will rightly question whether heaposs doing it to make more money or because heaposs secretly planning to quit as an MSP when he is inevitably replaced as Scottish Tory leader.

The dference is this one was hiding in plain sight. The Register of Members’ Interests is packed with facts and figures on MPs’ outside earnings and the identities of companies paying them. But it is such a dry document few of us would choose it for our bedtime reading. It is only because Prime Minister Boris Johnson bungled an outrageous attempt to save the career of corrupt MP Owen Paterson that the spotlight is now shining on it. The MPs involved say the public does not carethey pocket a few quid on the side – even though a few quid in their world adds up to £.million in consultancies and directorships alone so far this year.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section That £.million is petty cash compared to the fortune Geoffrey Cox has raked in from legal fees representing a dodgy Caribbean regime. He can make in an hour what a Brit on average earnings of £, makes in a month.

During the same three months, from October to December , Mr Cox devoted  hours to four outside jobs which paid him a total of £,.At the end of this spell, PM Boris Johnson gave Mr Cox a knighthood for his “parliamentary and political service”.Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the committee on standards in public le, said: “At first sight of the evidence available, it appears that Sir Geoffrey has questions to answer.

Nobody can do two full-time jobs at once.” Angela Evans, , said: “I’m personally appalled by the situation. I would not want him to be ed to office.”  The Mirror examined Mr Cox’s record in the last quarter of  and found no evidence he spoke in Parliament or asked written questions and he was not listed on any parliamentary committees. He completed the -mile round trip by car from his constituency home in Tavistock, Devon, to London seven times in the three months and claimed £. from the taxpayer each way.

Investcorp helped bankroll a firm which worked for the Chinese government on surveillance systems capable of tracking oppressed Uyghur Muslims. It is feared a million Uyghurs are held in “brainwashing” detention camps, that women have been sterilised and children taken away.  Articial intelligencecompany Sense Time said its technology could identy Uyghurs by facial recognition.

His earnings are within the rules, but the new details come as the Tories are mired in sleaze over extra income and Boris Johnson is under pressure to ban secondary jobs for his MPs. Last night Labour ’s deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “The corruption scandal that has engulfed the Conservative Party gets worse by the day.“We need an investigation to get to the bottom of whether this relationship has put our national ­security at risk and whether this technology has aided human rights abuses in China.”  MPs are paid £,.

But while kids will be painting pictures of them on their Christmas cards and singing the praises of Rudolph and his chums, British hunters will be paying up to £, to shoot them for kicks.Even more shockingly, the animals are officially classied as “vulnerable” and are already extinct in parts of Lapland. And scientists say hunting is one of the main reasons for their decline.The Santa slay holidays are being organised by a Russian winter safari company – whose website even features a grotesque image of a Christmas tree made of antlers from slaughtered beasts.  Other pictures show satisfied gun-toting ­customers proudly posing with slain reindeer, bears and other wildle in the snow. Adverts aimed at the lucrative UK market offer guided stalking holidays and guaranteed “kills”, starting at £, for seven-day reindeer hunts. Hunters wanting to take trophies such as antlers home to Britain will have to pay another £. “Mixed bags”, including bears, grouse, moose, wolves and lynx, rise in price, with a reindeer and moose package costing £,.  Anti-hunt groups have slammed the tours. Eduardo Goncalves, of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, said: “These sick serial animal killers spoil Christmas for children everywhere. “Rudolph and his mates pulling the sleigh are part and parcel of Christmas time for kids. Now it’s Rudolph lying dead in the snow. Reindeer may go extinctthings carry on as they are.” The hunts are organised by Baikal Royal Safari and take place in forests near Lake Baikal in southern Siberia. Participants are housed for up to a week in specially equipped hunting lodges or a “traditional hunting camp”, with saunas, wi-fi, skis, ­snow-mobiles, quad bikes and ammunition.  Online ads are designed to appeal to frequent hunters with their own weapons, such as rles and crossbows, and highlight reindeer special promotions over the Christmas period. Under a photograph of a gun-toting hunter and a slaughtered, bloodied stag with huge antlers, company owner Vladislav Lee promises “the most interesting and effective winter hunting in snow”. Under the terms of the deals, only high-calibre rles are allowed and promotional material stresses the price of any trophy “is not included”, but is negotiable. Advice on shipments of trophies is offered, as is the help of the company’s ­recommended taxidermist. Lee boasts the ­company was founded in  and operates in  Russian territories. Campaigners expect a Black Friday sale for the hunting trips to be online shortly.The hunts are legal in Russia and former leader Leonid Brezhnev was a keen participant. In Britain, the Safari Club International awards prizes for the highest number of reindeer kills chalked up by members. Its UK president, Steve Jones, said he had no connection with the Russian outfit but ­defended hunting and his company’s practice of making awards for kills. He said: “Critics are often ill-informed and motivated by financial or political gain. Hunting contributes to the protection of habitat and species that are threatened by ­poaching and human encroachment. Hunters enjoy making a valuable ­contribution.”  In , Mr Jones memorably clashed with presenter Piers Morgan when he appeared on breakfast TV to defend hunting because fans “enjoyed it”. Morgan threatened to shoot him with a bow and arrow, skin him alive and stick his body on a wall.Mr Jones is a former Tory mayor of Beaconsfield who defected to UKIP. In  he posted a snap of himself with Boris Johnson at a Tory party social event under the caption: “Out with my mate tonight.”The Prime Minister is under pressure to fulfil a two-year old vow to ban trophy imports. But a Bill has been delayed as Whitehall officials undertake a new round of consultation amid fears the new law will be watered down.  Campaigners fear a loophole will allow hunters to continue as normal for a “blood money” ­payment to conservation projects. Reindeer trophies such as antlers would still be legal under the proposed ban. The new law is likely to cover species listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species’ list of animals threatened with extinction. But reindeer are classed as ­vulnerable on the red list of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature – just one level below endangered.Campaigners want future legislation to cover trophy imports from all species and Labour MP John Spellar is preparing his own Bill. It is backed by the Sunday People and a host of celebrities, including Ricky Gervais.The comic behind The Office and After Le spoke out when we ran a picture of a shot polar bear projected by campaigners at Glasgow’s COP climate summit.  Campaigner Mr Goncalves said: “Boris Johnson says he plans to ban hunting trophies from some species. We need a total ban to ­discourage these people from killing reindeer and other defenceless animals.” Mr Goncalves, who recently received a “ days of Xmas” offer for hunting gear from a trophy hunting newsletter, added: “You literally can’t make it up!” Shadow Environment Secretary Luke Pollard said: “Trophy hunting is cruel and unjustiable. We need to ban imports of trophies from ­endangered species now.” aposMy bill to ban sickosapos - Comment, by John Spellar, Labour MP for Warley I’, backing the Sunday People’s campaign to outlaw sick souvenirs of trophy hunting such as reindeer.Next month, I willbe putting a Bill before Parliament to put this in law and I’m now inviting the Government to support it.Many of us remember the magnicent creature Cecil, the lion shot in Zimbabwe by a trophy-hunting American dentist in . Following an international uproar, the Government said it would ban British hunters from bringing home lion trophies, then promised to outlaw ALL trophies of endangered species. But the ban never materialised. And now the Government has postponed its own legislation, saying there’s not enough time in its schedule. So I’m offering them a solution. The Government can adopt my Bill. That way, we get the ban they’ve promised – and which nine in  voters want. Disgracefully, since , the year Cecil was killed, another  lion trophies have been brought into the UK by British hunters.  In all, around , trophies of elephants, giraffes, zebras, and monkeys have been brought back to Britainsince then.British trophy hunters even brought back the body of a polar bear last year. Now a company is even offering sick hunters the chance to slaughter reindeer for Christmas So, Boris, let’s give wildle, and voters, something to cheer this Christmas. Let’s ban trophies from Britain now.

With high levels of Covid immunity and a strong booster vaccination programme, the epidemiologist said he very much hopes a clampdown of the sort being ordered in some parts of Europe can be avoided in the UK. The Imperial College London academic also said he would be in favour of booster vaccinations being rolled out to younger age groups, once the most vulnerable have been given top-up jabs, in order to slow transmission. He said modelling from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine has indicated that expanding eligibility for the booster shots could help drive down transmission to low levels. The prediction comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Friday that storm clouds of a new coronavirus -gtcoronavirus wave are gathering over parts of Europe.Many European countries are seeing an increase in cases and preparing to step up restrictions. The Netherlands has confirmed a three-week partial lockdown amid surging cases, Austria is set to impose a lockdown on unvaccinated people, while German politicians are considering legislation that would pave the way for new measures at the same time as the countryaposs disease control centre is urging people to cancel or avoid large events.  Prof Ferguson - dubbed Professor Lockdown in some sections of the media - said the UK is in quite a dferent situation to its European counterparts due to having a greater level of immunity among its population following months of high virus prevalence. He said the fast rollout of booster jabs has also given the UK an advantage in the fight to control Covid.Acknowledging, however, that the UK is seeing a hint of an uptick in the last few days following weeks of declining case numbers and hospital admissions, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Weaposve had very high case numbers - between , and , a day - really for the last four months, since the beginning of July. That has obviously had some downsides. It has also paradoxically had an upside of boosting the immunity of the population compared with countries like Germany, the Netherlands and France, which have had much lower case numbers and are only now seeing an uptick. Prof Ferguson said he hopes the immunity levels mean the UK can avoid ing to social distancing restrictions this winter. He added: I think it is unlikely we will get anything close to what we had last year, that catastrophic winter wave. We might see slow increases as we did in October, for instance, but not anything as rapid as we saw last year.  We canapost be complacent, but at the moment I donapost think weaposll be in a situation the Netherlands is coming into where they really do need to get on top of rising case numbers using social distancing. I very much hope we can avoid that in this country. New data from the Office for National Statisticshas suggested infection levels are continuing to fall across the UK. The figures show about one in  people in private households in England had Covid- in the week to November , down from one in  the previous week. In Wales, about one in  people is estimated to have had the virus in the week to November , down from one in  the previous week. In Northern Ireland, the figure is about one in  people, down from one in  the previous week, while in Scotland it is one in  - down from one in . Meanwhile, the i newspaper has reported that the Government does not expect the pandemic to be over for at least another year, and in a worst case scenario lockdowns could be needed until . It said officials are working to three scenarios of how the pandemic might play out - optimistic, middle and pessimistic - with the most positive scenario predicting the virus will move into being treated like a routine infectious disease sometime between this year and . A Government spokesman said it is preparing for all eventualities with contingency planning when it comes to dealing with the virus.

Most people who pass by the address in Cardfaposs Lisvane suburb have no idea behind the overgrown hedges and wild garden is a vintage Victorian villa called Blair Athol which once had its own coach house. Itaposs deemed important enough to be included in Coflein, the online catalogue of archaeology, buildings, industrial and maritime heritage in Wales.And it is now going to auction for a guide price of £,,, reports Wales Online. The archive site describes the property as being a large brick mansion with a dressed stone entrance facade and fine Victorian veranda, dating back to the late th century and set in its own formal lawns to the front.  A photo of the exterior of the home before it was abandoned to ruin shows off its grandeur with a columned ground-floor veranda and balcony above it allowing for views across the city. The basic infrastructure is still largely intact, albeit the views obscured, but the interior paints a far more tragic picture. Graffiti on the walls and bordered up stained glass windows suffocate the glamorous urban mansion, while some of its period features, including fire places and a staircase appear to have been replaced.  But what the property does boast is plenty of space, including a number of basement rooms. The garden also stretches three-quarters of an acre. Huw Edwards, head of auctions and auctioneer at Seel  Co, said: The house itself is an attractive Victorian villa with many original features, though is currently in a poor condition with the grounds particularly to the front of the house overgrown.  In May  planning permission was granted for the demolition of the existing house and the construction of two houses and six apartments on the land instead. A cottage at the rear of the site that was converted from the villaaposs former coach house has already been flattened. The planning consent has now lapsed and came with a planning obligation under section  of the Town and Country Planning Act .  Briefly, this means that any developer must agree with the local authority, and is legally binding, to take agreed steps to reduce their impact on the local community and infrastructure. Mr Edwards added: The site is considerably larger than average for the road and could provide a development opportunity, subject to re-obtaining any necessary consents, or may be suitable for a landmark single Lisvane property considering the position and size of the plot. The existing house is in need of complete renovation but could still provide accommodation to be part of any development or demolished as per the previous planning consent. The building is going under the hammer with Seel  Co on Tuesday, December , at pm but interested parties must register via the companyaposs website in advance.

During the classroom visit, Meghan was snapped holding up a red pen as the kids shouted out the English words for colours. A spokesman for the Sussexes said the couple praised the tireless efforts. The visit coincided with Armistice Day as well as texts Meghan sent slamming the royals for berating Harry being made public.The duchess sent the SMS messages to ex-aide Jason Knauf in August  after Harry had stayed with Prince Charles for several days. She informed Mr Knauf she was drafting a letter to her estranged dad, Thomas Markle, at the time.  Meghan told Mr Knauf the catalyst was seeing how much pain Harry was being caused by his family in relation to her strained relationship with Mr Markle.

She is claiming the Duchess of Sussex ly briefed about her to the authors of a controversial book. And Samantha is to meet with her legal team again on Monday about the possibility of suing Meghan for “defamation, libel and slander” as well as “breach of privacy”.She told the Sunday People : “I’m speaking to one lawyer in England and one in the US as there are dferent statutory windows and dferent issues.”Samantha, , said she was left in shock on Wednesday when Meghan apologised to the Court of Appeal after emails were disclosed, contradicting a claim that she had not collaborated with the co-authors of biography Finding Freedom.  The messages, revealed by the Duchess’ ex-communications secretary Jason Knauf, show she sent him details about Samantha and brother Thomas Jr, asking him to pass them to writers Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. Writing in the third person, she also urged him to say that her siblings had “dropped out of high school” and that she had “never had a relationship with either of them”. She added: “Upon Meghan dating Harry, Samantha changed her name back to Markle and began a career creating stories to sell to the press. She had lost custody of all three of her children from dferent fathers.” Meghan has not spoken to Samantha since meeting Prince Harry in . Samantha, who disputes a number of Meghan’s claims, said: “I’m looking at suing for defamation in the US. In the UK, I’m looking at a breach of privacy and data privacy act breach because the statutory window for defamation is only one year in the UK.“Jason Knauf is subpoenable and the messages to [him] are evidence she was libelling and slandering me.

Some of her messages were presented as evidence against her claim the letter was purely private. The Mail on Sunday is seeking to overturn a High Court ruling that it unlawfully breached Meghan’s privacy by publishing extracts from it.  Meghan said she had “forgotten” giving Mr Knauf details of what to reveal to Scobie and Durand. Samantha, who has her own book, The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister, said: “It shows she’s manipulative.” It comes as Harry and Meghan are believed to be in talks to sign with crisis PR guru Howard Bragman, who has worked with both accusers and accused in the #MeToo movement.

The photogenic creatures, stars of the video game Minecraft, grow to cm , are rampant breeders, carry disease – and don’t do much . Experts worry that once the novelty wears off, many will be abandoned. Chris Newman, of the National Centre for Reptile Welfare, cautioned: “They’re not the ideal pet for everyone. People shouldn’t buy them thinking they’re going to be like highly interactive cartoon or game console characters – they’re not. “They’re not a hugely challenging animal to look after and they’re quite cute, butI’m being perfectly honest, they’re not the most exciting either – they don’t actually do an awful lot.”  Chris, who notes that they have a lespan of approximately  years, estimates there are already tens of thousands of axolotls in captivity in the UK. And there are fears they could end up being dumped in British rivers and lakes – just as terrapins were following the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles craze of the s. And axolotls, a type of salamander native to Mexico, carry a fungal disease that has made  other species extinct.  Lana Davison, of Southwest Axolotls, said: “Some people only want them because they’re in the game. We have heard of people who have dumped axolotls in lakes.” She added: “They can breed with other things we have already in this country and become an invasive species.” The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists axolotls as critically endangered in the wild. But the amphibians are also bred in home aquariums and science labs around the world, and are widely available on the internet. They sell for anywhere between £ and £. We found one owner in Doncaster offering an axolotl for free, however, because they had “lost interest”.

It’s frustrating. I’m a single parent with two kids and that extra petrol money has been used. I’ve had to take time out of my day to get there. I know I am unemployed but it’s still about respect and they are treating us like we are stupid. Just because we are unemployed we are not second-rate citizens. I felt like we were treated like second-class citizens and it’s all on their terms. It’s not right.They are a double-edged sword. They can punish you for not turning up on their terms. I even asked them how do I claim my petrol back  And they said I have to do it next week when I come in. I’m not sure how much fuel it cost but it’s a -mile round trip. It cost me my time and petrol. I rushed around and got my six-year-old to school and then went straight to Kidsgrove so I could be there on time. I have got a -year-old who walks to school. I have to arrange these appointments around the school run. Andrea received a text message from the DWP regarding the cancelled appointment as she was leaving the jobcentre on Wednesday morning. The DWP has confirmed that the building was closed for a deep clean. It said staff contacted affected customers virtually. A DWP spokesman said: Staff and customer safety is our priority as our Jobcentres provide vital support to those who need it. We continue to work closely with the unions to ensure our sites are Covid-secure in line with public health and Government guidance and keep health and safety under constant review.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Single mum Jen Otter, , was determined not to fill her new home with unloved toys when she ed to England in March , after living in Thailand for seven years - then five months pregnant with Rosie, now two, and with daughter Lilly, four. So, she killed three birds with one stone by joining the toy swapping website Whirli, which helps the environment by reducing waste, allows Jen to save money and cut back on clutter in her home all at the same time. Costing just £. a month- compared to a recent Nationwide building society survey claiming parents spend on average £ per child at Christmas alone - Jen of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, was thrilled by the concept. She said: Itaposs great. As a single mum, I canapost afford high-end gts, but by swapping them I can get my kids really nice presents for a fraction of the cost - and I get to send them back when theyaposre done with them! For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The early years teacher has no qualms about ing presents the moment her children tire of them. She said: Last year I sent Lillyaposs present back on New Yearaposs Eve. She had this big Lottie treehouse with all the dolls. It was amazing and should have cost around £. But within a few days, she was bored and wasnapost playing with it anymore, so I sent it back. This has to be far better for the environment than binning unwanted items and seeing them end up in landfill. Returning from Bangkok in Thailand in  after splitting with her partner, Jen and arrived back in England virtually empty-handed.  She said: Lilly was nearly two and I was five months pregnant with Rosie. We moved in with one suitcase, so we didnapost have any toys with us. Friends offered to buy them for Lilly, but the idea of having all these new toys annoyed me because it was such a waste. She added: I witnessed her show interest in toys for a few months and then get bored of them, so I wanted to find a way to not create a lot of landfill. When her research revealed sites where she could rent toys, she decided the borrowing scheme was a far better option and meant she could afford to get them big ticket presents for Christmas and birthdays that she could never normally afford. I use it for their birthday and Christmas presents, she said. She added: My children feel treated and get access to really high-end toys which I wouldnapost be able to afford and then they go back when theyaposre done. At the moment, Rosie has this ride on recycling truck that she loves and would have cost about £ to buy. But I know in a few days sheaposll be bored of it, so itaposll be going back for another family to use. The scheme means Jen can rent toys all year round and she selects her Christmas items in early December, then s them as early as New Year. You can rent the toys for as long as you want, she said.  So there are dferent packages, but on mine I get  tokens to spend on the website, which is equivalent to £. The extra £ is for free pick up and delivery. She added: If you keep a toy for over eight months itaposs yours to keep forever andyou want a really popular toy, you can get it waitlisted. Soyouaposre organised, you could do that at the beginning of December and then hide it away until the th. Iaposve always been able to get the toys the girls want as there are so many and you never have to wait very long. She added: Last year, Lillyaposs Lottie treehouse was beautul. She woke up on Christmas morning to it and loved it.  But then, by New Year, I sent it back because she stopped playing with it. Itaposs completely normal to my daughters now for their toys not to be there forever. With a poll by the British Heart Foundation reporting that a quarter of parents admit to throwing away toys that work perfectly, while children have an average of four toys they have never played with, Jen is determined her family will buck this wasteful trend. She said: We live in a two-bedroom house and donapost have the space for lots of toys. In the past, I would buy from charity shops and then when the kids were done with the toys, Iaposd give them back. But then I worried about them not being used, as you donapost always know what will happen to that toy once youaposve given it away. She added: I like renting the kidsapos toys because instead of going to a landfill or gathering dust on a shelf, they go to another family for their children to enjoy. Obviously, my kids also have permanent toys like magnet tiles, a toy kitchen, a dolls house, wooden dolls and lots of books. But I do feel, especially with Christmas gts, that by swapping them for other toys we get the best of both worlds. And she encourages her family to buy experiences like dance lessons or theatre tickets for her girls, rather than toys, to further reduce the risk of things being thrown away. People always askthey can buy them gts, but I say no, suggesting they get them an experience instead, she said. Thataposs far more valuable and the memory will stay with them for a long time, rather than wasting money on a gt theyaposll be bored with in a matter of days. But Jen is clear thather girls love a present she will keep it. If the girls ever get really attached to something, I will buy it, she said. The site we use allows you to buy the toy youaposre renting. So a few months ago we got a Toniebox, an audio and music player, and they just loved it. She added: It stayed for about four months and in the end, I decided to buy it. The longer you rent a toy the more it decreases in value so it was actually at a discounted price when I bought it. I paid £ when it would have been £Iaposd bought it new in a shop. By doing it this way I was able to make sure that the girls liked it before spending a lot of money on it. Now Jen hopes to inspire more parents to join the Christmas revolution, by renting instead of buying their little onesapos festive gts.  I do hope people think about renting over buying, she said. She added: I think people find it hard to wrap their head around renting gts, but I think itaposs the new way to do Christmas. Sometimes I go to peopleaposs houses and there are just so many toys. They have loads of stuff and it just never gets played with. Renting toys does not reduce the fun and excitement on Christmas Day, according to Jen, who says the most expensive item she has rented was the Lottie dollaposs house. She also rented a micro scooter with a seat which would have cost approximately £ to buy. She said: I tell my daughters that I give money to Santa. Lilly will choose the toys she wants, or talk to me about them, then I hide them away for December.  She added: By swapping the kids toys throughout the year I am able to afford high end presents and not spend a fortune. I think itaposs a great idea and is a great way to ensure an exciting Christmas for the little ones without breaking the bank. It makes Christmas affordable but also it means that youaposre not buying presents for the sake of it. Youaposre getting the kids what they want. She added: Itaposs great because even though they get bored of them in a few days, we just swap them for something . Instead of the toy becoming unused, we swap it for something  they love in a few weeks time and the excitement happens all over again.

She told Wales Online: When I found out about an incident involving a motorbike, I immediately rang him and just knew it was him, I didn’t want to believe it and it’s hard to explain how I felt but my heart felt empty, I just knew. The pain, the heartache, feeling numb, disbelief, you don’t want to believe it and you think it will never happen to you, I still don’t want to believe it, he was so young and we just started le as a family - that’s what hurts the most. The family were expecting to move into a new home, but were unable to after Mikeaposs sudden passing. Amy said Mike was such a loving, affectionate partner, my best friend.

After Mike passed we have come together as a family and I think Ayla and Zion have played a massive part in that, they certainly keep everyone busy. Through all this heartbreak, Amy wants to raise awareness that le can suddenly change for anyone. Mike was such a positive person and that was the way to be in le, he taught me to be positive and I’m going to carry that on in his memory, times like this you have to be positive. Don’t get me wrong, I cry every day, I just miss him so much, but it’s ok to cry, it’s ok to be sad. If I’ve learnt anything it’s to be in the present rather than the future because le can change in a blink of an eye. Be grateful for every second that you get to spend with the people you love.

And it seems the threat to the natural world has also affected his eight-year-old son Prince George. Prince William once admitted the young royal was left so saddened by a Sir David Attenborough documentary about extinction, he told his father: I donapost want to watch this anymore. Speaking to Sky News last year, the future king said the episode proved too much for young George. William said: The most recent one - the extinction one - actually George and I had to turn it off, we got so sad about it halfway through. He said to me aposyou know I donapost want to watch this anymoreapos.  Why has it come to this and you know heaposs seven years old and heaposs asking me these questions already, he really feels it, and I think every seven-year-old out there can relate to that. Williamaposs comments came after George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis quizzed Sir David last year asking him questions about topics including his favourite animal, and the threat of extinction. In the cute clip, George asked Sir David which animal he thinks will become extinct next.

Earlier this week, adventurer Bear Grylls recalled how he convinced George to eat an ant and has shared his excitement in convincing a future king to eat an insect. Bear was a guest at Prince William’s Kings Cup event where he struck up a conversation with the third in line with the throne. While Bear hadn’t exactly set out to convince George to eat the insect, he was stunned when the future king did agree to give it a go and said he thinks the young man is a “little hero” for throwing caution to the wind.

Sally Morgan, who was Princess Diana’s spiritual guide, met Harry when he was seven during a visit to Kensington Palace.And as our exclusive picture reveals, they were reunited at a swanky fancy dress party where Harry rushed up to her saying: “You knew my mother.” Sally, who started her career telling futures for free but can now charge £, a session, claims: ■ She predicted Diana’s tragic end ■ She knew that Harry would marry a brunette ■ And she foretold the couple would stay together despite going through a “tempestuous time”. Sally also claims she still receives messages from beyond the grave, where Diana watches over her sons. Diana died aged  alongside partner Dodi Fayed in a  car crash in Paris. It was around  years later that Harry called Sally to ask: “What do you think about how my mother died ”  He also asked her concerned ­questions about his “bruv” Prince William – as well as what colour hair his future we would have. Sally, , recalls how she met the adult Harry at the fancy dress do at Kensington Roof Gardens around . “He was there dressed in medical scrubs,” she said. “He wouldn’t have any ­photographs taken and he came over to me and said, ‘Sally, you’re the lady who used to see my mother’. “I said, ‘Yes I did. The last time I saw you, you were about seven’. “And he said, ‘Oh, Sally, I remember, my mother would often talk about you, she spoke to you a lot’. “I said that she did and then he askedI wanted a picture. “He was with a group of lads and they were all tipsy, and I remember he bought everyone a round of drinks. It was a fun party.”  But it wasn’t until eight years ago that Sally received a phone call from Harry asking for a reading. They spoke for  minutes in what Sally believes was his first attempt to get to grips with his mental health, which he has since publicly spoken about many times. Sally said: “I was on holiday in St Tropez and he called me and the first thing he said was, ‘What do you think about how my mother died ’.” She says she told him to speak to Diana’s elder sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, because “she will tell you what I told her before your mother passed away”. Sally claimed: “I had spoken to Sarah before Diana’s death and had made a prediction the Queen was going to die, that she was in a really dark place and I could see a pavement. “I said they are going to drag her out and give her CPR and she is going to have a heart attack. That is what the Princess of Wales died of, a heart attack. I said a week later the Queen Mother will die because I can see her funeral. Well the Princess of Wales had the Queen Mother’s funeral that had been arranged because they had all their funerals arranged, and Diana took that. I didn’t tell Harry that though, I just told him to speak to his aunt.”  Following Diana’s death, Sarah questioned Sally about her prediction. Sally said: “After Diana died, Sarah said, ‘Well, you said the Queen’. “But I predicted that before she did the interview with Martin Bashir, where she said, ‘I want to be known as the Queen of Hearts’.” During the call with Harry, they also discussed his fears for his brother and who his own future we would be.  “How is my bruv going to be  Is he going to be OK ” she says Harry asked. Sally said she replied: “Of course he is. He will be good and he will be king, but he is in a dferent bubble to you.” She said he replied: “That is why I am always going to worry about him”. At that point Harry was still a bachelor, had dated mainly blonde women and was on off with Cressida Bonas.  But Sally says she told him he would marry someone very dferent. She said: “One of the sweetest things he said to me was, ‘What colour hair will my future we have  Will she have blonde hair ’ I said he would marry someone with dark hair.” Sally believes that their conversation was a prelude to “him waking up to his own mental health” struggles. It wasn’t until  that Harry spoke publicly about it but he has since then championed the ­subject for others.  He admitted to years of attacks both of panic and rage, disclosing that his le was in “total chaos” for two years. In her new book, Secret Spirit, Sally praises Harry’s openness, of which Diana “would have been very proud”. She says the princess told her “as a royal, you were expected to brush those kinds of feelings under the carpet”. “Harry and Meghan are helping drive the debate forward,” Sally added. Despite her le being very dferent to Harry’s, Sally can relate to his “awful” grief – she lost husband John in September, aged . They were married for  years and together for . Now, Sally is helping others with bereavement with John being her guiding light in the spiritual world. And she believes no matter what lies ahead for them Harry, , and Meghan,  – who have kids Archie, two, and Lilibet, five months – will “be together forever”, adding: “Harry will never abandon his children.”For details on Sally’s services visit sallymorgan.tv.

The six-year-old is fourth in line to the throne and already used to public events where she and her brothers have been brought up to be dignied and amazingly rarely throw tantrums. Prince Charles and William have made efforts to reduce the size of the Royal Family but Charlotte will remain a key figure andher dad does become king then she will be given a title to reflect this.The reigning monarch usually hands out new titles to royals who get married but the six-year-old may get another title altogether regardless of whether she marries or not, reports The Express. As Princess Charlotte is set one day be the daughter of the king she may well be given the Princess Royal title which is used for the eldest daughter of the British sovereign.  The title was first introduced to mimic the French royal title of Madame Royale back in the s. The is Princess Royal status is not automatically given to the king or queenaposs eldest daughter and it has to be bestowed by the monarch themselves. Currently it is Princess Anne who is the Princess Royal as she is the Queen and Prince Philipaposs only daughter. Before Princess Anne, the title was held by King George VIaposs sister, Princess Mary.Royal expert and author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story, Duncan Larcombe, told TownandCountrymag: “The title of Princess Royal is traditionally bestowed on the eldest daughter of the monarch.It is a title that remains for le, so Princess Charlotte will have to wait at least until the death of the current Princess Royal.  Princess Anne didnapost get her Princess Royal title until the Queen had been on the throne for  years. Mr Larcombe added: Princess Anne had to wait until  before her mother the Queen bestowed the title of Princess Royal on her, even though the title had been vacant since . The Princess Royal title would be separate to becoming a duchess which is a status which is sometimes given by the monarch when a member of the Royal Family marries. But there is not a lot of consistency to this as female members of the Royal Family in recent years have not been given a duchess title like Princess Margaret. In the case of the Queenaposs sister, her husband Antony Armstrong-Jones was made the Earl of Snowdon rather than a Duke. But it will be in the hands of William what royal titles he decides to give out to Charlotte and her brothers George and Louis.

I saw it this week and she certainly gives an extraordinary portrayal of a fragile and paranoid bulimic trapped in a miserable marriage. She even looks a bit like the princess too, thanks to skilful styling and identical clothes. But this celluloid Spencer is most definitely NOT Diana. And the depiction of her nightmare Sandringham Christmas in  is an absolute travesty. Anyone expecting a Diana biopic soon learns this is “a fable from a true tragedy”. Or rather, a fairytale woven from fact and fiction to tug at the heartstrings. I don’t expect many people will leave the cinema believing that Diana really talked to her dead father’s jacket or ate the pearls from a broken necklace with her soup.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section And even the most ardent fans would struggle to believe she was saved from suicide by the ghost of Anne Boleyn. But mixing truth and fantasy in this way is damaging – because it tarnishes the real Diana’s memory and taints the monarchy too. Netflix hit The Crown does the same. Diana’s friend Jemima Khan quit as an advisor saying the new series fails to show her enough “respect or compassion”. Prince William is furious that the focus on Diana’s final months will “perpetuate the  narratives” about his mother. But Prince Harry is keeping schtum.  He has admitted watching The Crown and says while it’s only “ loosely based on fact” he is “way more comfortable with that than I am [with] seeing stories written about my family or my we”. And, of course, there’s that £million deal he’s struck with Netflix to make his own shows. This week Meghan and Harry both took another pop at the “toxic” tabloid news media. But then Meghan had to apologise to a court for “forgetting” she had asked an aide to brief the authors of that biography she and Haz didn’t co-operate with. It was interesting that she referred to herself in the third person in emails… like the star of her own royal movie. And that she wrote a letter to her father, calling him “Daddy” in order to “pull at the heartstrings” in case it leaked. As a result of this mix-up she may now be called to give evidence on oath at a trial of her newspaper privacy claim. And while the American actress could easily give us an Oscar-winning performance, the Duchess of Sussex can’t. Because Megxit has killed this royal fairytale – and now we just want the facts.

The Tu- ‘White Swans’ targeted the North Sea, the Moscow defence ministry admitted. Their -hour flights came amid some of the highest East West tensions since the end of the Cold War three decades ago. Russia admitted that British reports were correct and the strategic bombers were escorted by RAF Typhoons as they approached the UK. It came as tens of thousands of Russian soldiers are camping near the border with Ukraine amid fears an invasion is being planned within the Kremlin. It was confirmed by the RAF that British planes had intercepted two Tu- bombers before the footage emerged.  Two strategic Tu- long-range aviation rocket carriers performed a scheduled flight in the air space above the neutral waters of the Barents, Norwegian and North Seas,” said the Russian defence ministry. “The duration of the flight amounted to about  hours.” During their voyages the Russian aircraft were intercepted and escorted by the Royal Air Force, reported TASS, citing military sources.  The Tu-s, supersonic iable sweep wing heavy strategic nuclear bombers known in the West as Blackjacks, were intercepted by Typhoons from RAF Lossiemouth and Coningsby, said British military sources. An RAF source said: Typhoon fighters were scrambled against unidentied aircraft approaching the UK area. Russia said: ”All flights of aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Force are performed in strict compliance with the international rules of using air space.”  The Mirror told of the jets being intercepted yesterday which followed a similar incident in August involving Typhoons being scrambled.Planes were also then sent from RAF Lossiemouth to intercept the Russian planes. The RAF later released an update regarding the earlier incident and said Typhoons were joined by an RAF Voyager from RAF Brize Norton which were also sent to assist.  The two Tu-s were deployed yesterday by Vladimir Putin over Belarus where a migrant camp is the focus of major international concern. The West accuses Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko of aposweaponisingapos asylum-seekers in a aposhybrid warapos with the West. He has allowed them to come to Belarus so they can seek to pour into Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, before seeking entry to Germany and other EU countries plus Britain.

And while the monarchs may be expected to be dining on everything from caviar to foie gras on the big day, a former palace chef has revealed the Christmas meal he served up couldn’t have been more traditional.It will be the first festive holiday in years that the Queen has sat down to a Christmas dinner without Prince Phillip, who passed away on April , aged . The late Duke of Edinburgh spent four nights in King Edward VIIaposs hospita l in central London receiving treatment for a pre-existing condition from December  in , prompting concerns he would miss out on a family Christmas.However, he was discharged at .am on Christmas Eve, allowing him to head back to Sandingham to spend Christmas with Queen Elizabeth. And on Christmas Day in , The Duke of Edinburgh was away from home on a voyage around the Commonwealth. The Queen remained at Sandringham House, where she has spent every Christmas since her father’s death in . The Royal Family’s traditional Christmas celebrations at Sandringham House are back on this year, after the Queen and Prince Philip spent the day apart from their loved ones last year for a Covid-safe affair. A former palace chef has previously spilled the beans on what their festive meal might entail describing a traditional, but fairly lavish, Christmas feast.Darren McGrady, who used to work in the royal kitchens, said the family was likely to dine on a big lunch after church, which would feature “a salad with shrimp or lobster, and a roasted turkey, and all of your traditional side dishes like parsnips, carrots, Brussels sprouts, and Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert”. Theyaposre actually boring when it comes to festivities. They didnapost do hams or anything, just traditional turkeys. “We did three turkeys for the Queen and her family in the royal dining room, one for the childrenaposs nursery and then more for the  or so staff, so everyone had a Christmas lunch. McGrady went on to add: “The turkey is served with mashed and roast potatoes, chestnut or sage and onion stuffing, cranberry sauce and bread sauce. Vegetables include brussels sprouts, carrots and roast parsnips.”  A traditional homemade Christmas pudding is served after the main meal and is “decorated in holly, doused in brandy, and the palace steward would carry it, flaming, into the royal dining room,” says McGrady. Mr McGrady claimed the family stuck with the same meal “year after year”. However, last year Mike Tindall gave a dferent account. Speaking on his rugby podcast last year, he said the royals do much of their festive celebrating on Christmas Eve, and give their staff Christmas Day off. Christmas Day is a little more quiet because itaposs actually a cold buffet because they give everyone the day off, and their big day is Christmas Eve,” he said. While a festive tipple would usually be considered a must on the big day, it is unclear whether the monarch will be enjoying a wine, or a gin this year, following on from reports she has been advised to go teetotal. The Queen, who has recently used a walking stick for the first time on royal visits, is said to be recovering after she had tests and spent a night in hospital last month. However, the Mirror exclusively revealed earlier this month how the Queen was “totally committed” to hosting the festive holidays for all her extended family again this year.A source said: “Her Majesty is very much looking forward to hosting her family at her Norfolk home for the Christmas holiday and there is much preparation to be done in time to accommodate everyone who has been invited. “The Queen has many happy memories of being at Sandringham with the family over Christmas.It was not yet known whether Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would be making their way over from the United States for the occasion.Comment MORE ON The QueenChristmasRoyal FamilyChristmas dinner\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As the fire alarm wailed, she ran into the room and found huge flames climbing up the walls where the candle had been placed.Pauline and her son Matthew, , didnapost even have shoes on when they raced outside to safety. Fire crews rushed to the home but the flat was completely gutted, and everything not burnt to a crisp is now smoke-damaged.Pauline told the Record: Itaposs been awful. My mission is to get everyone to get rid of these candle burners.  They are lethal. I was in the house when this happened. I came in from my work and lit my candles because I love the smell of them. I went from the living room into the kitchen - and I was just hanging up washing on the phone to my aunt when five or ten minutes later I heard my smoke alarm going off. I grabbed a tea towel to wave the smoke away from the fire alarm - but then I could smell something. Out the corner of my eye I saw everything was on fire at the side where my candle was. I had dried flowers at the side of my fireplace and they had already caught fire.  By the time I was in the room there was no way I could have tackled it. I live with my youngest son and he was in the house so my priority was just to get us out. It caught very fast, it was going up the walls and everything. After running down the stairs, they heard a loud bang which also alerted their downstairs neighbours. Fire crews raced to the scene of the blaze but Paulineaposs council flat was gutted by the flames.  They managed to contain the fire to the living room but all of their possessions in the property have been smoke damaged beyond repair. Video footage and pictures show the property devastated by the blaze. The fire service contained the blaze to the living room but everything  was damaged by the smoke. Pauline fears the worst because she didnapost have insurance, which she called a luxury I couldnapost afford. Despite her best attempts to salvage some items, they all stink of smoke, she says. Pauline tragically lost her husband Ron Foster four years ago when he was diagnosed with lung cancer and died six weeks later. Family friend George Haney has set up a fundraiser to help support Pauline and Matthew and try to get them back on their feet again.

At the age of , mum-of-two Emma Hughes thought she was too young to have cancer, Wales Online reports. But after finding a lump in her right breast she decided to go to her GP just to be cautious. It was the start of a long and traumatic journey for Emma who not only needed both breasts removed, but also both oies which brought on early menopause. Emma is sharing her story to support the Stand Up To Cancer campaign in Wales. I ignored it for a while, but eventually went to my GP when it didnapost go away and seemed asit might be getting bigger, recalled Emma, who first saw her doctor in . The GP assured me it was probably nothing because of my age, but did refer me to the breast clinic where after being examined I was given an ultrasound. When they did another in my armpit area and said they wanted to take biopsies I began to worry, although at  I still did not think it could be cancer.  Emma said she was taken into a room and askedshe could come back the following Friday to discuss her results. I brought my sister with me when I came back to be given the devastating news that I had breast cancer which had spread to my lymph nodes, she said. It was a complete and utter shock and my sister was in tears. I felt guilty for putting her through this, at the same time thinking I was going to die and worrying about my sons.I had such an intense feeling of guilt that I had waited before going to the doctor to get the lump sorted, and I was scared.I then had a lot of scans and blood tests to see what kind of cancer it was. It was a relief to find it was still at stage three and not spread anywhere .Sharing the news with her two sons Iestyn, , and Bailey, , was dficult for Emma, now .My younger son has autism and profound learning dficulties - he is non-verbal. But my eldest, who was  at the time, is quite grown up and took it very well when I told him, with the support of the family care nurse, that I had cancer. We gave him a child-friendly book to explain everything, and I made it clear to him I was never going to give up fighting it.The boysapos father helped take care of the kids, even though we are not still together, and social workers helped me get respite care. I also had my sister, mum, dad and friends around me who were all fantastic. Emma had six rounds of chemotherapy and  sessions of radiotherapy. As a preventative measure, she also had her breasts and oies removed.She said: I lost all my hair, including my brows and lashes, and felt exhausted and sick. My treatment was finished by the end of June, , and my oncologist called me in to discuss preventative treatment. My cancer was hormone-based so he suggested removing my oies.In October I had the operation, and in February, , I had a double mastectomy with reconstruction as a further preventative measure. It was a good thing I did, as pathology after the operation showed traces of cancer the size of a grain of sand, although they had not shown up on a CT scan prior to surgery.I am now on Letrozole which makes me a bit tired and achy and I will have to stay on for  years.Emma, from Blackwood, described how her cancer diagnosis led to positive changes in her le. She said: Since the end of my cancer treatment I have gone from strength to strength, in spite of the oy removal putting me into early menopause which gave me hot flushes and panic attacks which I realise, having had counselling before my operation, are just hormonal.I have lost three stone, left my job at a call centre and am training as a nurse. I have turned my le around and have a new outlook. I no longer take anything for granted and try to appreciate all the little things. I realise health is wealth you can have everything, butyour le is on the line, nothing  matters.Emma is backing the Stand Up To Cancer campaign in Wales, the joint fundraising effort from Cancer Research UK and Channel , and is calling on everyone to stand united against the disease by raising money to accelerate le-saving research.Itaposs thanks to research and treatment that I’m still standing and can look forward to a future full of special moments with my loved ones, she added.In Wales, around , people are diagnosed with cancer every year. Stand Up To Cancer helps to take breakthroughs from the lab and transform them into cutting-edge treatments that could help save the lives of more people like Emma. To donate or fundraise, visit suc.org.uk Emma added: With charities having been hit so hard by the pandemic, it feels more important than ever for everyone to do what they can. So, I hope people in Wales will stand up for me and everyone affected by this devastating disease. The campaign, now in its ninth year in the UK, has raised more than £m, funding  clinical trials and projects involving over , cancer patients across the country. These include the development of new treatments that use viruses to fight cancer, clinical trials testing potentially more effective ways to deliver radiotherapy and improved surgical techniques for bowel cancer. Ruth Amies, Cancer Research UK spokeswoman for Wales, said: We are very grateful to Emma for helping us to continue our mission. One in two of us will get cancer in our letime, but all of us can play a part to help beat it. By raising vital funds, supporters could make a real dference to people like Lizzy. Every penny will go directly to our le-saving research, helping our tireless scientists to develop tests and treatments for those who need them most. If we all stand together, we can save lives.

Posting on Mumsnet, the woman wrote: I canapost eat first thing in the morning so I have always eaten mid-morning, at my desk, sometimes something cold, sometimes something that needs a minute or two in the staff microwave.Past employers have never had an issue with this. Iaposm fairly new to this job but in the past two months, no-one has ever raised it as an issue. We have access to a microwave and toaster so sometimes Iaposll bring in a tub of beans, or eggs that Iaposve already put in a bowl and whisked at home so it takes  minutes in the microwave to heat them.  All during the space of time it takes me to make my first cup of tea of the day - which is taken after having already put in - hours work since I got in that morning. All of a sudden my line manager took me aside and said aposit had been noticedapos that I was heating up my breakfast and that I was no longer to do this as it was in work time, that the microwave and toaster were only for lunch breaks, unless I decided to split my break over both. The woman continued: This seems ridiculous to me as it takes max  minutes and I then bring it back to eat at my desk whilst working. I have seen colleagues gone for much much longer than thisthey get into social conversation with colleagues. Also, this instruction was directed only to me, not the team or department as a whole, so it feels very personal. The woman said is important to take regular breaks throughout the day. She added: Am I being unreasonable here  Do others do this at work with no issue  As I said, past employers have never had issue with it and I donapost take the p*** with it. One mum said the woman wasnapost being treated like an adult. She continued: It annoys me when a workplace doesnapost treat people like adults. So I would probably sweetly say aposOkay thataposs fine, Iaposll take the five minutes out of my lunch hour and just have a  minute lunch breakapos. I imagine smokers take up much longer out of their day to have smoke breaks. Others thought the woman was in the wrong. One mum wrote: Beans egg on toast is taking the p*** and stinks the office out. Iaposve never, ever seen anyone at work have more than a bowl of cereal or a yogurt. You are being unreasonable - and cheeky. Another said: I used to have a colleague who did this and it annoyed me so much. While she was stirring up her porridge and blowing it to cool it down, she couldnapost properly perform tasks. She could only type with one hand, often couldnapost answer the phone as she was chewing. It would take her longer to so a simple email or input some data while she was eating than it would normally, and while this was only for - minutes per day, it was every day and very annoying. Also microwave eggs stink.

The cute tots, a boy and a girl, are biological half-siblings. Little Elijah John and Olivia Eva share a room with their mums Zoe and Holly Anderson Ross, who are “over the moon” with their new arrivals. Holly, who gave birth to Olivia on October , said: “We are so happy and relieved they are here with us and they’re both healthy and perfect. “It’s taken a long time to get here, so it’s a massive relief. Our ­family is now complete. They both feel like both of our babies. It’s not like Olivia is mine because I gave birth to her and Elijah is Zoe’s because she gave birth to him. They are both equally our ­children and they are both so loved.”  The couple, of Hailsham, East Sussex, were dating male pals when they met at a party and experienced an ­irresistible “instant attraction”. At first they dismissed their boyfriends’ suspicions that they fancied each other. But the truth finally came out and Zoe and Holly got together in . They married four years later, with Holly becoming a second mum to Zoe’s daughter Shannon, now .And they told their remarkable story in an interview with the Sunday People seven years ago. Since then they have been trying for a family but suffered three ­miscarriages. Joy finally came when they fell pregnant at the same time via DIY insemination. Zoe, , who had Elijah by Caesarian ­section, said: “It took a long time to get to this point, with two little cherubs in our home. “After trying for so long, we almost gave up. But then we decided to double our chances by both getting inseminated. The next month we fell pregnant to the same donor – it was like fate.”  The sperm donor does not want to be involved with the babies but he is happy for them to contact him when they turn . And the pair’s former boyfriends are no longer in their lives. Holly, also , said: “I imagine our exes will be indferent when they hear we’ve had babies. It wasn’t nice for them when we met and fell in love. “So I don’t imagine they’ll think much of us having kids together.” While barely four weeks since Eliljah arrived on October , both tots are already in a happy routine. Holly added: “Elijah is the more vocal of the two while Olivia is quieter – they’re both quite laidback.  “We’re very lucky. The first week after bringing them home was a total whirlwind of feeding, changing ­nappies and trying to sleep for the odd hour or two before attending to the babies again. “When one slept, the other was awake and vice-versa. “It’s like having twins. It’s total luck of the draw who gets the dirty nappies and who feeds the crabbiest one – we share them both equally. “Over the past three days they’ve fallen into a great routine where they’re feeding every three hours and sleeping at the same time.  “So me and Zoe have started to get more rest.” Holly was able to be at Elijah’s birth, while she was still heavily pregnant with Olivia. But when it was her turn to give birth, a medical condition and being induced at short notice meant she ended up doing it alone. She said: “Being at Zoe’s elective C-section was great and it all ran smoothly. It also meant I had  days to really bond with Elijah before Olivia came along. I cherished that time. “I was induced a week early, ­because I had obstetric cholestasis, a liver condition which can cause foetal distress. Once I was induced, my waters broke quickly and it all went much faster than we were expecting.  “My dad was meant to be my birthing partner, because Zoe had just had the C-section so she wasn’t allowed in the hospital because of Covid. But he didn’t make it in time.” Luckily, all went well and the ­siblings were introduced to each other later that day. Holly – who like Zoe is now a full-time mum – went on: “There was an instant bond, they lay together staring at each other and touching each other’s faces. “Now they look for each other when they’re apart and they sleep in the same room. “They’ll share a cot when they’re old enough and can top and tail. I hope they grow up with the strongest bond. “Elijah can look out for his little sister and protect her, no one needs to know he’s only  days older. “Elijah was lb oz, while Olivia was lb oz, so he’s bigger – but they were both the same . They look like each other. They both have dark hair and blue eyes. You can tell they’re siblings – they’re adorable.”  Zoe’s daughter Shannon is loving being a big sister. Holly said: “They are very cuddly babies, so Shannon is making the most of all the cuddles. She lets them hold her finger with their tiny hands. “They’ve already got such a lovely bond. She’s a great big sister.” Zoe said: “I’m so glad the pregnancies are over and everything is fine. We have everything we wanted.” And Holly added: “Christmas this year will be brilliant! We’ll be enjoying the fact we’ve finally got the family we’ve waited so long for.” Comment MORE ON HospitalsPregnancyGiving birthMiscarriageTwinsSperm donationFertilityChristmas partySunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sean MacDonald, , a chef from Toronto, Canada, lives with his -month-old puppy, Hazelnut – who eats better than most humans. The doting dog owner spends a few thousands of pounds on his pooch every year, feeding her meals that have TikTok users drooling. His fantastic dishes such as foie gras, puppy-friendly sushi and rack of lamb have seen the chef rack up . million likes for his videos, as well as , dedicated followers. Hazelnutaposs first-ever human-inspired meal was a plate of A wagyu ribeye steak, pea puree and carrots.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I spent a lot on the first wagyu meal - but she’s my baby and she comes first before me, Sean said. I think her most luxurious meal has recently been beef with foie gras, bone marrow, truffle and lobster. I research everything before I feed it to her and I make sure it’s safe for dogs. These are all treat meals and I feed her a well-balanced diet of raw meat, vegetables and high-quality dog food. Sean later uploaded the dish to TikTok where, overnight, the video gained up over , views. Sean first became interested in cooking when he was just  but didn’t start his career as a chef until five years later. He said: I would help my mum with making dinner and I would always look forward to meals more than anything . I enrolled in a culinary school and travelled around the world, working under dferent chefs and was very studious with cookbooks. The process of making the food and putting care and attention to detail throughout is what I love the most. Overwhelmed but thrilled with the reaction from people on TikTok, he continued to post more videos, with their most popular attracting . million views and over , likes. In the clip, a tiny Hazelnut wags her tail and licks her lips, excited at the thought of her gourmet meal to come. The dish comprises poached prawns and celery, covered in a broth made from prawn shells, roasted celery and peanut.  Hazelnut is clearly a fan, happily lapping up every last bit. One person commented: Ok I understand the point of this video is you making your dog good food, but I would genuinely die for her. Another wrote: Your dog eating better than me. Meanwhile I give my dog two extra treats and his poops are weird for days, said a third. I just ate a crunch wrap supreme and your dog is eating Michelin star quality food, someone  commented.  Despite receiving a few negative comments, Hazelnut has built a loyal following and has even been puppy-spotted in real le, while out on daily walks. Sean added: People will stop us in the street and say, ‘Is that baby puppy Hazelnut ’ and I’ve had people yell from car windows and others who have named their puppies after her. I started to do this frequently because I realised how much people enjoyed watching them and it was more toward posting something positive and fun for people to watch during Covid. If we could make someone smile, we were doing something good and she’s grown up to be a very happy and healthy pup.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

In a video that has since been deleted, Hannah wrote: I’ve been waiting to tell my story, adding that she was a #StubbleSurvivor. A few people tried to diagnose the wound, with a few saying it looked like a staph infection - a highly contagious infection caused by staphylococcus bacteria, types of germs commonly found on the skin or in the nose of even healthy iniduals. So was it a staph infection or did he have beard oil in and you had a bad allergic reaction to it  one person asked.

Units from the SAS and Parachute Regiment have been warned they could be sent to the country within hours. The preparation comes after defence chiefs and the head of MI advised No that Russian President Vladimir Putin represents a clear and present danger to Ukraine and the West. Video footage that emerged appears to show Russian tanks, armoured vehicles and troops massing near Ukraine. Now a British force – consisting of SAS members, the Special Reconnaissance Regiment, medics, engineers, signallers and up to  paratroopers from  Air Assault Brigade based in Aldershot, Hants – is being set up.  A source said: “The high readiness element of the brigade was told it may need to deploy at very short notice. “Between  and  troops are ready. Their equipment is packed and they are ready to fly to Ukraine and either land or parachute in. They have trained for both eventualities.” Britain’s most senior military officer, General Sir Nick Carter, warned that there is a greater risk of accidental war erupting between the West and Russia than at any time since the Cold War. General Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, said: “We have to be careful that people don’t end up allowing the bellicose nature of some of our politics to finish in a position where escalation leads to miscalculation.”  Tensions have been rising in eastern Europe after the EU accused Belarus of flying in thousands of migrants to engineer a humanitarian crisis on its border with Poland, a dispute that threatens to draw in Russia and Nato. Putin warned that unscheduled Nato drills in the Black Sea posed a serious challenge for Moscow and that Russia had nothing to do with the crisis on ally Belarus’ border with the bloc. US officials have alerted European allies about a possible attack, which would be the culmination of a long-running Kremlin feud with Ukraine. Russian officials insisted their troops were only sent to the border in response to the increased Nato border activity.  Senior British defence sources said hundreds of paras supported by artillery units could drop into the region within  hours of the green light. Footage on social media appears to show huge amounts of Russian military gear near the city of Voronezh,  miles east of the Ukrainian border. A large number of Russian tanks, howitzers and armoured vehicles were reported to have been moved there. The Kremlin has said the West was “playing with fire” by deploying warships and spy planes in the Black Sea. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reassured Ukraine of Washington’s “ironclad” commitment to its security. The Ministry of Defence said: “The UK and our allies are unwavering in support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.” On Friday, the RAF said its Typhoons escorted two Russian Tu Blackjack bombers away from a ‘UK area of interest’ over the North Sea.

As COP was originally to be held in November that year, a small group of Scottish artists planned to use the power of music in a live performance to promote global wellbeing and climate justice.With pilot funding from Creative Scotland, community music group Oi Musica, specialising in street band music, joined forces with the all-inclusive Soundhouse Choir and award-winning folk musician Karine Polwart.As inspiration, Karine drew on the mythology of Saint Mungo and Glasgow#s famous #the tree, the bird, the fish and the bell#.The song Enough is Enough was born.As the pandemic took hold and the conference was postponed, plans changed. The piece became a music video, and the idea to invite many more people to add their voice took shape.An invitation was put out to community groups to record their own version of the song to increase pressure on leaders to make decisive action at COP .Described as #a crashing, tumbling outpouring of music that starts with a few small drops, gathering pace and momentum as more people join, and building to a climax# the full force was unleashed at .pm on Wednesday November  in Govan with a mass performance as part of COP .At Govan was Tayvallich-based musician Sarah Phizacklea # but on the Saturday before travelling to Glasgow Sarah invited a group of people from Tayvallich, Carsaig and Crinan to her barn to create their version of Enough is Enough.Sarah explained: #It felt wonderful to add some weight to such an important cause, a bit more pressure on our leaders to actually commit to tackling climate change. And it was so much fun!#Our video has been uploaded to the growing collection of voices from all over the country and globally.#There were about  of us in total.

Born in , the fourth child of John Forbes-Sempill, baronet of Craigie, Ewan was thought to be a girl at birth and christened Elisabeth. But from the earliest age, he identied as male. So pronounced was his masculinity that by the time he was six, his mother was encouraging family members to call him ldquoBenjie and consulting paediatricians about possible medical interventions.After a sometimes dficult adolescence and ious treatments, Elisabeth became Ewan. He qualied as a doctor, and began working as a GP in Alford, Aberdeenshire, with little controversy. When he fell in love with his housekeeper Isabella, known as Patty, his birth certicate was amended ndash as was possible back then ndash so he could marry her.Wedlock was one thing, though inheritance another. The rule of primogeniture decreed that when Forbesrsquos older brother William died in , the baronetcy should pass to the next male sibling. That ought to have been Ewan. But not everyone agreed. One cousin, John, mounted a legal challenge on the basis Ewan \"is now, and has been all along, of the female sex\".Zoeuml Playdonrsquos book, The Hidden Case of Ewan Forbes, recounts these events and, more importantly, the extraordinary ones that followed. Emeritus professor in medical humanities at the University of London, she stumbled across the legal challenge while fighting for trans equality in . She and some lawyers had taken a High Court action to allow trans people to once again amend their birth certicates. That right had been swept away by a precedent-setting case known as Corbett v Corbett in . Then, a judge dissolved the marriage between trans woman April Ashley and her husband Arthur Corbett on the grounds that Ashley had always been a man and could not alter her birth certicate.Playdonrsquos side lost the case, but remained mystied. They knew people had successfully altered their birth certicates in the past and could not understand what had prompted the change. But then one of the lawyers was contacted by Ashleyrsquos solicitor, Terrence Walton. He said that before going into court in , he had been called into the judgersquos chamber and shown a previous case, then sworn to secrecy.That case was Forbesrsquos. And now, Playdon is revealing the details Walton couldnrsquot. Preparation for the court battle had been traumatic. Forbes was subjected to intimate physical examinations by a specialist who pronounced him to have two X chromosomes and therefore to be genetically female. But then Forbes did something audacious. He told doctors a coughing fit had caused a ldquotesticle to suddenly descend. He performed his own \"biopsy\" and sent the specimen to a lab.Forbess claim was medically impossible he must have bought the testis sample and faked the biopsy. But it was impossible to disprove. Eventually, the judge found in his favour. Forbes gained the title and kept his marriage. But, according to Walton, the case had led to a \"blanket ban\" on altering future birth certicates because ldquothere are some interests it is more important to protect than the rights of the iniduals.The victory proved pyrrhic for Forbes, too. The widespread conviction that he had committed perjury affected his standing. He deregistered himself from the General Medical Council and became moody and irascible.The case of Ewan Forbes was a landmark, and kudos to Playdon for unearthing it. But her book is not without its problems. The first ndash not Playdonrsquos fault ndash is that a lack of first-hand material means we donrsquot get a feel for Forbes as a person. He never wrote in any detail about how it felt to be presented to the Queen as a ldquodebutante while sporting HRT-induced hair on his chin, or to have his genitalia the subject of legal speculation. There is no suggestion he ever embraced the role of trans campaigner.The reader, then, relies on Playdonrsquos ability to enter that imaginative space. But she has so fully embraced the role of trans campaigner, she sacrices nuance for polemic. Take her treatment of Forbesrsquos older sister Margaret. Margaret initially sided with John, providing a written statement to the effect that her brother had been brought up as a girl. Later she changed her mind but she died before she could alter her testimony.Playdon has no time for Margaret. She makes reference to her \"deadnaming\" Ewan. And, of course, Margaret was in the wrong. But it doesnrsquot take much fellow feeling to understand why she behaved as she did. As a lesbian, she was barred from marrying her own partner. Yet she watched Forbes change sex and marry his. In addition, the rule of primogeniture discriminates against women. Whether Forbes was male or female, she was the older sibling. No wonder she felt resentment. I would have liked to have seen that intersection of injustices properly acknowledged, and the emotional conflicts more fully explored.Instead, Playdon attempts to write a definitive history of transphobia, weaving reports and symposiums in and out of her account of Forbess le. Every line of thinking she agrees with is legitimate everything she disagrees with is ldquopseudo-medicine, which is not to say that she is wrong, just that the black-and-white way in which she presents her argument has the effect of undermining it.This is not helped by her comparison of the subtle sht in official policy on trans people to \"the quiet bureaucratic process\" that led to the Holocaust, or her habit of dismissing wholesale media representations of trans people such as Coronation Streets Haley Cropper.The irony is that a greater focus on the human story with all its sadnesses might have played to her advantage.At present in the UK, trans men and women still require a Gender Recognition Certicate to legally change sex and even those who obtain one cannot inherit a title. Playdonrsquos aim is to convince the reader of the virtues of self-identication. In the end, though, it was the ability to empathise with Forbess suffering, much more than her proselytizing, that left me wondering why society makes it so dficult for trans people to be themselves."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13195534.jpg?type=article-full","title":"princess-switch-3-romancing-star---scotland-makes-cameo-netflix-festive-film","story":"The Princess Switch : Romancing the Star.Wait, didnrsquot we watch that last year That was The Princess Switch: Switched Again.

Itrsquos poignant and heartfelt ndash considering yoursquore not very bright rsquoNot surprisingly, Cox takes less than a nano second to work up an ire, to offer at least a hint of the fearsome creature hersquos revealed all too often on stage and screen. ldquoAre you talking about yourself, I presume Indeed, not. \"Let me explain.\" Or rather, let me grovel for a couple of minutes in the hope this interview doesnrsquot collapse before itrsquos begun.\"There is a line in the book, Brian, in which your mother once wrote to your prospective mother-in-law saying, Brianrsquos not awfully bright. But hersquos got a good heart. I was quoting Molly Cox ndash and attempting to highlight how our parents can be a little inappropriate at times. I realise you probably wrote this book at least a year ago, and some of the detail will have slipped to the outer edges of the mind. Sorry, Brian, I was trying to be funny.\"Thankfully, the penny drops and the Dundonian blood s to room temperature. ldquoAh, yes, I forgot about that, he says, laughing, perhaps in relief hersquos not having to converse with a self-destructive idiot. ldquoMy ma was trying to be kind. But sometimes the wording Scots mothers use isnrsquot exactly right.For sure. I tell him the tale of how I once had a parachute accident and a few days later, while I was in hospital, my mother told a friend I was going to be OK. She added: lsquoTherersquos very little sign of brain damage.rsquoCox laughs at this. Hard. I like him a lot for letting me off the hook. ldquoYes, Scots mothers do that. And they are wonderful.Brian Cox had a wonderful mother who worked hard to look after her five children in a two-roomed flat in Dundee. But she had serious mental health issues, no doubt exacerbated when Coxrsquos father, Chic, a shopkeeper, died when young Brian was just eight years old.For most of his early le, he was looked after by his older sisters and an aunt. ldquoYou donrsquot think about it at the time. You just get on with it. But what I didnrsquot realise until I wrote the book was that when yoursquore eight there is a certain resilience. What I also didnrsquot appreciate was that my brother, Charlie, who was  at the time, must have been really affected in terms of grief.He adds: ldquoI have a -year-old son now. And being a teenager is tough enough. When we think of teenage hormone attacks, we think of females. But we should also remember that male teenagers go through all levels of s***.Charlie ran off to the army. Young Brian endured an early le of eating scraps from the chippy. Surviving. Is it fair to say this early tragedy created a sense of detachment  And did that, perhaps, play a part in his becoming an actor, perhaps separating himself from the real world  ldquoYou know, I think you are absolutely right. In le, you sometimes have to find ways to protect yourself.He adds: ldquoItrsquos funny you should mention that detachment because I later came to realise that it led to a sense of absence growing up, and it has really been something Irsquove had to deal with.The actor, who has undergone therapy, admits he was absent a great deal during his first marriage to we Caroline, and lsquohad little affinity with the process of fatheringrsquo his two children. ldquoI still beat myself up about that. It was almost a medical fact. There was nothing I could do about it. But it takes over me sometimes. I still feel a sense of grief about relationships Irsquove had in the past, the break-ups with ladies Irsquove had. I have to acknowledge that this feeling of being absent is still with me yet try and move on. Itrsquos about the journey.Brian Coxrsquos lucky escape from poverty came about when he discovered Dundee Rep. Aged , this lsquorough-speaking urchinrsquo found work as the lowest assistant. But he loved the world, of sweeping up, banking cash, setting Lynn Redgraversquos stage wig in rollers. ldquoIt was a blessing. It was an egalitarian world where I was welcomed. Donrsquot get me wrong, I knew I was also a curiosity. [He mimics his old accent lsquoTalkinrsquo like that, ken.] But I couldnrsquot believe my luck and the kindness shown to me.Cox resolved to study acting and took himself off to LAMDA in London. And this career choice offered up a surrogate father in acting legend Fulton Mackay, who would later find TV fame as Mr Mackay in Porridge.ldquoHe was probably the most important man in my le. He had also gone into therapy because his mother died when he was young from diabetes, and his father travelled all over with the NAAFI. Fulton had no real home. And he shared all this knowledge with me.Cox offers a warm smile. ldquoI found in theatre the family I craved. And [that connection with other actors] continues. I also have this right now with the Succession family. I love all of them. Sure, there are moments, but I deeply adore them.Brian Coxrsquos acting ndash and le ndash story features a rainbow of colours. His journey from Dundee to RADA is full of passion, his tales of rep theatre companies illuminating. One minute hersquos appearing on stage as Captain Ahab in Moby Dickthe next hersquos sharing actor Linda Thorsonrsquos flat in New York with thousands of cockroaches. Or hersquos warding off dressing room advances from a fruity, very handy, Princess Margaret. He laughs when you suggest had the roles been reversed, he would have been taken to the Tower.Along the way the actor picked up major acclaim and theatre prizes such as two Olivier Awards. What emerges however is that Cox has never assumed technical greatness he has continually looked at technique and style. ldquoYes, and Fulton encouraged that need to improve. He was a great learner.But what of the rejection  Itrsquos also a world in which you can be turned down because you are too small, too tall, too heavy, too slight . . .you canrsquot ride a horse like Willie Carson . . . ldquoYes, itrsquos hard, but especially for females in the business. And Irsquove seen many who have been under siege at the hands of the likes of the horribleWeinstein. I have nothing but respect for those whorsquove survived this element of the business. But of course, the women had to keep it secret. They were under so much pressure not to reveal. But now they can.Cox speaks of egalitarianism in theatre. But he admits there were glass ceilings facing working class hopefuls. Scots, for example, could play army sergeants, but not officers. ldquoThatrsquos true. It goes back to the time when we lived in a feudal society, where everyone knew their place. We still have that. We still have monarchy.Brian Cox is most certainly a class warrior, but interestingly he supports teaching of Received Pronunciation, which was once forced upon working class students. ldquoThe thing about the sound of RP is that you have  vowel sounds you can choose from. And in standard accents, Scots, Irish or Welsh, there are only  vowels to choose from. It actually increases your range. So, itrsquos not a class thing at all. When you think of people such as [John] Gielgud or [Paul] Scofield, they had a tremendous range. And it was really important for me to learn clarity.He adds: ldquoOne of the problems in movies these days is there is not enough clarity. Too much mumbling. Brando mumbled in Streetcar, of course, but his Marc Anthony revealed immense clarity.Brian Cox became, undoubtably, one of the greatest theatre actors of his generation. But he decided to side line that part of his career in a bid to conquer Hollywood. Does he regret moving to the States and becoming a multi-millionaire film star, living in New York, working with the likes of Brad Pitt in Troywhen he could have been appearing at the Royal Court for pound a week ldquoNo, he says, laughing. ldquoAnd remember, for me the cinema was essentially the proletarian art form. Thatrsquos where I first saw Albert Finney who gave me hope and possibility. In Dundee we had  cinemas, which showed double features and I could see eight films a week. I could see Danny Kaye and James Dean and Brando. And the films did have a classless element to them. I always knew thatrsquos where I wanted to go.Itrsquos no real surprise that Cox has made such a success of his film career. He brings with him a weight, a confidence and a toughness. He has little hesitation in telling directors what he thinks of their instruction. ldquoWe Celts came from Europe and settled in Ireland and Scotland. We have a tough character.Invoking his cultural history sees the actor leap onto his political soapbox with such ease yoursquod never guess he had -year-old knees. He expounds for at least a few minutes about his incredible disappointment with Labour, how he was appalled by Tony Blairrsquos decision to invade Iraq and the demise of social democracy in the UK. ldquoI used to think the Scots Nats were a joke party but now I think the only place that social democracy seems to be ing is my home country. So perhaps thatrsquos where my allegiance lies.Does he believe independence can contend with economic realities  ldquoThose realities are now being defined by the condition of the planet, he says. ldquoThatrsquos why kids really are the future. Wersquove taken so much for granted and we canrsquot anymore. My big problem is that I fly. When Irsquom playing Logan Roy, I can be in the likes of Dubrovnik next week and I have to get there. Wersquore on the horns of a horric dilemma. And Russia and China wonrsquot come to the party.And even our friends the Australians who insist on mining coal. Arenrsquot they a set of selfish drongos  ldquoYoursquore right there, pal. And Irsquom also intolerant of America when it comes to coal, because it doesnrsquot make any sense. The government is behaving like frat night in a minor university.Brian Cox calls it as he sees it. He certainly isnrsquot backwards about coming forwards about the movie stars he doesnrsquot rate. Cox adores the likes of Alan Rickman but hersquos not a huge Michael Caine fan, although he admits Caine is ldquoan institution.Edward Norton is ldquoa pain in the a***. Steven Segal however is up there on the Hopeless list. And he turned down the chance to star alongside Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean because Depprsquos acting is panto.But does he feel perhaps his criticisms went a little too far  ldquoYes, thatrsquos a very good question and Irsquom planning to write an addendum. Irsquove been getting a lot of brouhaha, in particular from Johnny Depp fans. But itrsquos also made me think I want to put a perspective on things. Yes, I have called people an ass**** in the book, but then I realised that this referred to a time.ldquoSo, what Irsquom going to do for the American publication, is write that there is a possibility that people can change.Cox admits the business can cause allow people to behave very badly. ldquoYou can,yoursquore not very careful, lose the plot. And you do. During rehearsals for his first play in New York, he remembers asking the stage manager to fetch him a cup of tea. \"He looked at me with absolute astonishment and said, Why dont you get your own tea  And I thought, Yes, absolutely right. Why dont I get my own tea \"He adds: ldquoBut we should allow for the fact that sometimes we go through a dark tunnel ndash and hopefully come out the other side of it. There may have been something extraordinary going on in actors lives which impacts upon their performance.The theme of the book appears to be an actor in search of an identity  Is this fair  ldquoOh, yes, he agrees. ldquoI feel the search to be an on-going process. You really never stop. Yoursquore always weighing up the good stuff and the crap that goes on around you. And you spend your le trying to get a balance.He grins. ldquoAndyoursquore a Gemini like me, itrsquos doubly hard.And me, Brian. ldquoWhat  Yoursquore a Gemini as well  Oh, yes.He breaks into a loud laugh. ldquoWell, as a fellow Gemini yoursquoll know exactly what Irsquom talking about. We have this side of personality that says lsquof*** them.rsquo And then therersquos the other side that says lsquoOh, no. We have to consider this opinion.rsquoHe becomes even more exercised. Not Logan Roy angry at all, but certainly Agamemnon loud and commanding.ldquoYou know, Brian, therersquos a constant dialogue in my head. My whole le has been about this, with my head battling with the idea of what makes right and wrong. And the opposite sides of my head canrsquot agree a lot of the time.Perhaps it has helped make him he actor he is  Take Logan Roy, for example. He has real angularity. Hersquos a man conflicted. ldquoYou know. You understand, he says.I do. And I now know not to suggest actors may be a bit dim.Putting the Rabbit in the Hat, My Autobiography by Brian Cox.

insanely - still driving senior clinicians and other staff out of the NHS earlier than they otherwise would have planned to.ldquoThe problem with that is that workforce planning is based on the number of people we have coming in at the bottom meeting the number of people leaving at the end, andyou are losing five years of a consultant career - and didnrsquot factor that in  years ago when you were planning intakes to medical school - then yoursquore going to start seeing these gaps.ldquoYou donrsquot have the specialists there to train the young doctors coming through, and you donrsquot have the people experienced enough to replace the senior consultants whorsquore leaving.ldquoThese were going to be the people wersquore depending on to get through the backlog of work, so thatrsquos going to be one of the big issues.ldquoBut for many small units where you may only have one or two people doing very specialist things, especially in areas like the Borders or Inverness or the Western Isles, losing one person can be the dference between a safe, sustainable service and a service that collapses.ldquoRetirement is one part, but % of the consultants we surveyed said they are planning on reducing their clinical sessions in the next year, and therersquos not the ability of those left behind to suck up the extra work because theyrsquore exhausted too.ldquoIf therersquos no solution to the pension tax issue, then people are just not going to have any incentive to stick with it - theyrsquore burnt out and itrsquos costing them a fortune to keep working.Dr Graeme EunsonDr Eunson said he was aware of one senior medic in Scotland who had paid pound, in pension tax over the past five years in addition to income tax and pension contributions.Recent UK figures indicate that the number of NHS doctors taking early retirement has tripled over the past decade, with Graham Crossley of wealth management experts Quilter blaming ldquoeye-watering pensions tax bills for ldquo[disincentivising] doctors to take on extra hours at a time when the health service is creaking.Many are reportedly turning to financial advisors for help after receiving five- or six-figure tax bills unexpectedly.The long-runnning problem relates to the NHS defined benefit system, which means that any growth in salary can translate into a large perceived growth in pension contribution.: Whats really behind the worst winter crisis facing Scotlands NHS Most workers are allowed to save pound, a year into their pension tax-free, but for higher earners this tapers down to just pound - above which they begin to trigger a tax bill.Chancellor Rishi Sunak sought to ameliorate the issue in the March  Budget by raising the salary at which this taper threshold kicks in from pound, to pound,, but a change in working patterns during the pandemic - including consultants working extra shts - has tipped many more into the bracket for high charges.ldquoFor most people staying on longer doesnrsquot get you a better pension, it doesnrsquot get you more money, it just brings you larger and larger tax bills each year,\" said Dr Eunson.ldquoAt the moment, all people have is the option to refuse to take on extra responsibilities or to reduce their hours below  sessions a week.Chancellor Rishi Sunak raised the taper threshold from pound, to pound, in March A similar initiative is already in place in some English NHS trusts, and the Welsh government has written to its health boards encouraging them to pursue this option.Dr Eunson said this would give senior medics a \"powerful incentive to delay retirement\".: Warning social care in Scotland at very real risk of collapse this winterA spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said its powers to resolve the issue are ldquoseverely limited as pension taxation is reserved to Westminster.She added: ldquoWe wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on  June  asking for such consideration to be given to the current pension taxation regime to help ensure that health workers in Scotland can fully contribute to our recovery efforts.

Setting books, such as Carved in Stone, describe the world in which the adventure takes place, and can be used with any TTRPG rules system, including Dungeons and Dragons.Carved in Stone takes players to a period just after the Battle of Nechtansmere in  CE, when the Picts defeated the Northumbrians to become the leading political force in what is now Scotland.Carved in Stone, with its historically accurate details, will enable narrators to create adventures in which players explore the landscape, meet members of society, and create their own stories.The cover image of Carve in StoneDr Jeff Sanders, Project Manager of Dig It!, said the intention was to use role play games as a vehicles to help people explore, enjoy and learn about Scotlandrsquos past.ldquoWe chose to set it in Scotland at the end of the th century because so much recent work that has completely changed our understanding of this medieval Scotland, he added.ldquoItrsquos a fun, exciting and dferent world that is starting to resemble the Scotland we know but is still a long way from it too.ldquoMost roleplay games are set in a fantasy world, but this is set in real world setting.The setting is built around the aftermath of the Battle of Nechtansmere, when King Mac Bridei, a charismatic but ruthless figure who remains in the background of the Carved in Stone setting, defeated the Northumbrian threat and set the wheels in motion for a unied Scotland.Excavation at a Pictish fort at Burghead, MorayPlayers must prepare for the Kingrsquos arrival in a small village where a funeral is to take place, requiring a series of quests to gather necessary items.ldquoThey will have to get their booze from the monks, get cows and embark on a hunt, he adds. ldquoThe game allows us to introduce all the core themes of Pictish le: subsistence, the economy, farming, technology and Scotlandrsquos place in the world.ldquoThe Romans have been gone for several centuries, but trade networks are there, so Scotland is still importing from the continentyoursquore a high-status Pict, you will want to dress in colourful silks and drink fine wine.The book provides historically accurate details about elements of le at the time that could help or hinder players during their adventures.

I felt he was curious about me. He always had that look. He moved around with a group of about twenty stags that lived away up the head of a glen and most of them keep their distance a little bit. But he would always come that bit closer and he was always one that had that curious look on his face.Red deer are one of the photographers big loves, which is why he has followed up his book, On The Trail Of Red Squirrels, with another on these imposing animals. That love started young. McIntyrersquos father was a gamekeeper and deerstalker who took him out with him sometimes while he was working in Perthshire, and later the Highlands. Always, the young boy noticed, there was something about the deer that stood out more than other animals. He recalls on one occasion, as a small child, on a visit to a nearby estate, he came very close to a stag for the first time.ldquoI had never realised how large the deer were, he writes, ldquountil one was standing right in front of me. His shoulders were above my head ndash of course a full-grown stag would be far taller than a six-year-old-boy, but seeing it was overwhelming. His breath seemed like smoke in the freezing air. The head, antlers bigger than his shoulders, dipped back and forth over the food. I remember holding up my hands and realising that one antler would be longer than my arm. It would have taken both my childish hands to wrap around it.The stag wasnrsquot there for very long but it made an impression. ldquoI remember,\" he says,\"looking up at this huge, impressive stag, and meeting his dark brown eye. I remember losing sight of him in the crowd as more and more deer ran down from the hills to join the feast. I remember longing to reach out and touch their magnicence, and my fatherrsquos gentle warning, lsquoTheyrsquore wild, not for trusting.rsquoEver since then, he says, he has been fascinated with red deer. Though McIntyre didnrsquot become a gamekeeper like his father, or his brother, or his nephew, he became another type of stalker, a wildle photographer. He recalls there were only a few times that he shot deer himself, though for him, growing up in the stalking family he did, that was very much a rite of passage.ldquoI never wanted to be a deerstalker myself, he says. ldquoI have shot a few deer obviously, being brought up with it, but from a very early age I would rather take their picture. But Irsquove experienced it and done it and thatrsquos maybe not a bad thing. Itrsquos let me see how itrsquos done. Itrsquos not as easy as some people make out. It does involve quite a lot of skills to do it properly.He shot a couple of hinds when his father was doing the hind cull, and in his late teens even shot a stag. ldquoAnd that was it,\" he recalls. \"Once Irsquod done it, I didnrsquot particularly want to.In recent decades, the deer has become a target in the firing line of another mission: the fight against climate change and bioersity loss. Its numbers, ious reports have said, must be controlled because of the ways in which deer browse on young trees and prevent reforestation. Its an issue that seems all the more potent in the wake of COP, as we strive to hit national targets.In  a report was published by the Scottish Governmentrsquos independent Deer Working Group, which delivered a range of recommendations including phasing out the use of lead ammunition to cull deer, modernisation of existing deer legislation, the development of robust deer management plans and enhanced monitoring of deer numbers.Earlier this year, when Ben Macpherson, then Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment, announced the policy proposals, he made clear what the strategy was about. ldquoAs the scale of tackling climate change and the bioersity crisis increases, and the measures needed to address these challenges become ever more necessary, it is evident that a signicant stepping-up of deer management efforts are required.In , when the Red Deer Commission was set up it was estimated that the speciesrsquos population was around ,. In more recent years the population has been estimated at around , to ,.McIntyre writes in his book, ldquoEveryone has their own ideas about what would be a stable population for red deer across the country. My research shows that in  , a total of , red deer were culled from an estimated Scottish population of ,ndash,. Contrary to what some would like you to think, this population is in decline. Some would say that not only is this a good thing but they hope it will continue, suggesting that a more stable number is somewhere in the region of , total population. That implies a horric number of red deer would have to die.He remains a fierce advocate for the red deer and a critic of the stronger deer control measures and some of the working grouprsquos recommended policies. Above all, he wants to bring back love and respect to the deer. ldquoThat was a big part of doing the book, he says, ldquoto try to get some respect back for them, because sadly over the last literally two decades their stature so to speak has been much maligned, reduced to nothing more than a pest in some peoplersquos mind.This defence is partly informed by his own family history. He comes from a line of men involved in the deer business and has observed the way their management has changed over the years. ldquoMy grandfather broke in deer ponies after the war, he says. ldquoThe Highland ponies were very much in use for getting the carcasses off the hill. And my grandfather used to train them. That was his job for Glen Artney down near Comrie. He used to get train loads of Highland garrons in and they would all get trained up to carry deer. They would get sent out all over Scotland to ious dferent estates.By the time McIntyre himself arrived in the world, his grandfather had already finished up work in that business. ldquoHe had been kicked so many times with the horses he became quite crippled - so he sort of retired from that a bit earlier than he would normally have done just because of so many kicks he had in the legs from working with the horses.It was, he recalls, by going out with his father, by listening to him and watching the deer, he would learn about their habits and the best way to approach them - which would stand him in good stead in his career as a wildle photographer. ldquoThese things became almost instinctive and not something I really thought about.Coal, steam, empire and COP : Glasgows emissions storyIt also gave him an appreciation of the way of le of the gamekeeper and deerstalker, which has made him an advocate, even in times when a lot of the drive in conservation and rewilding is towards dramatically cutting deer numbers, even zero tolerance, in order to promote forest regeneration.\"Therersquos nobody,\" he says, \"really has more respect and admiration for the deer than a proper deerstalker. They do their job in a very considered way - and I think they probably know more about deer than anybody.McIntyre is a reminder that urban advocates of rewilding, like myself, can have their view of the deer, but they donrsquot really know them, or the impact they have, like he does. He is also an advocate for the rural worker, who comes in many dferent forms, and for their continued existence on the land. Some of his arguments remind me of those of crofters, who speak for a kind of nature restoration that still allows room for people in the landscape.His love of the deer is clear in his photography. One of his most prized shots is of a stag shaking off water in the winter. ldquoThe deer obviously spend quite a bit of time in the rain,\" he says. \"And you get stags or hinds when theyrsquore lying down for a long time,itrsquos pouring down theyrsquoll just become like a big sponge. You can almost guarantee the very first thing theyrsquoll do when they stand up is shake and you get this amazing plume of water comes off them. Their head stays almost motionless, but their whole body twists and this fantastic spray of water comes off.Its also clear from his writing how intimately he has got to know the deer. He writes, for instance, about how they struggle in spring, describes their rolling in the peat, the way that hinds and stags live separate lives until mating season, the spectacle of the rut. ldquoOn one occasion, he recalls, ldquoI was on the Rothiemurchus Estate and could hear stags roaring above me. I was about fty yards from where I needed to be to see them when I heard two crashing together ndash a sound not unlike the clash of wooden swords. I knew immediately that it must be antlers locking together. Desperate to witness this battle, still unsighted, I ran the last fty yards until I could peer cautiously over the knoll to see them. The light was poor and the photographs are not among my best but the spectacle was amazing: the sound and the power of two stags locked together, pushing at each other.\"What McIntyre is most critical of is the zero tolerance approach to deer adopted by some estates. ldquoThere are several rewilding estates that have followed that strategy, he says. ldquoIt suits their agenda. They want full scale natural regeneration, and therersquos no getting away from the fact there has been over-grazing, and theyrsquove adopted this policy which is how theyrsquove managed to get such prolic regeneration. But that has resulted in the deer virtually being wiped out of these areas. His anger is clear. ldquoItrsquos not management. They dress it up, theyrsquore very careful with their words, theyrsquore not stupid these people. Theyrsquoll say things like wersquore increasing deer cull numbers or wersquoll increase the management, but what they actually mean is itrsquos zero tolerance. Anditrsquos a deer itrsquos shot regardless of what age or sex. Itrsquos not about selecting animals. The deer has just become like a pest.Among the recommendations of the working group report of which McIntyre is critical, is the removal of the close season for males, so that they could be shot at any time, and reducing theof the female close season. ldquoThatrsquos reducing them to an even lower status than they are now. The impact would be, I think, quite catastrophic. It means deer can be shot any time.The question of to what degree red deer numbers need to be controlled, and how to control them, is one that has exercised a great many estate managers, environmentalists and conservationists. I have long been aware of the debate and the controversy around it, and have spoken to many out there who would argue against McIntyre. Even Simon King, writing the foreword of Mcintyrersquos book, notes that they do not agree on the matter of deer management.Im sceptical too, and nervous, about promoting a stepback from deer control at such a critical point in our history, in the midst of a climate and bioersity crisisin which forms of rewilding, to which large populations of deer are no friend, arebeing seen as an answer.: Rewild Scotland: \"Beavers in all rivers. Lynx and wolf back.Nevertheless, theres also something I appreciate about McIntyrersquos fierce defence of the deer. I too have felt sad about the way in which those animals which have prolerated because of the way we humans have shaped the landscape, have become themselves demonised.Anti-deer sentiment, he writes, ldquoseems to have been growing over the years. Forestry and red deer have always been in conflict because of the supposed damage the deer do to trees. However, the rewilding movement, which has been gaining support in recent years, is even more averse to deer.Whatever strategy we take in terms of their control and management, I dont think we humans will ever stop admiring the red deer, and in particular its mature stag. Its asthat response to their presence and physicality is built into us. McIntyres photographs are testimony to their beauty and magnicence. Catch sight of a stag on the hill, or in one of his photographs, and it takes your breath away.Chasing the Deer: The Red Deer Through The Seasons by Neil McIntyre is published by Sandstone pressWe want to bring you the best The Herald has to offer every day.

She spent the war operating in the North Sea, taking part in a raid on British convoy to Norway in  which resulted in the sinking of two Royal Navy destroyers and nine merchant ships.SMS Karlsruhe was a light cruiser, launched in  in Kiel and named after the Imperial German Navy’s famous raiding cruiser which was lost in the Caribbean at the start of the First World War.

As of this evening  pupils have been confirmed as COVID-positive, along with five members of staff. A further four members of staff have recorded positive lateral flow test results.As a result, the nursery has been forced to close entirely, while four primary classes will remain home.The classes to close from Monday to Wednesday are: PM, PE. Classes PE and PM are to close on Monday only at this time. Online learning will be offered to affected pupils.According to a statement released by OIC, this evening, the situation will remain under daily review andthe position changes, parents and staff will be updated.The remainder of classes at Papdale Primary School will be open on Monday as usual.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Staff have been working tirelessly over the last week to try and ensure Papdale Primary and Nursery were able to remain open in full, however, this has now reached the point where it is simply no longer possible. There are several factors for this including staff reporting positive PCR test results, being contact traced by Public Health, and the supply teaching staff list having been exhausted.“We realise that this may cause childcare issues for working parents and that is partly why we will keep the closures to an absolute minimum and monitor and manage the situation on a daily basis, ensuring that the settings are able to reopen once it is safe to do so with the appropriate staffing levels in place. It is also vital that we keep our educational facilities open whenever possible for the learning of our children, who have already missed out on so much these past  months of the pandemic.“I, again, take this opportunity to thank our staff, parents and pupils for the way in which we all continue to manage these situations, which are challenging for everyone. We must all continue to do our bit to try and stem the transmission of the virus, which is undoubtedly here for some time to come.

They should be in our communities protecting the vulnerable people who need them most.ldquoThatrsquos why our Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill is so necessary.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way. Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The rise will take effect from December ,  and affects firmus customers in Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon , Limavady, Derry Londonderry, Newry and more than  other towns and villages in the surrounding areas. firmus say wholesale global gas prices have increased by % from a year ago and by % since the previous tarf review that came into effect on the st October. The change in tarf means an extra pound. per week on to the average household bill. Dr David Dobbin, Chairman of firmus energy, said: We very much regret having to increase our tarf however steep increases in global wholesale gas prices have forced our hand. This is a not a firmus issue, but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. We know this is an unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable. We have been consulting with key stakeholders and will be introducing a support scheme to be delivered through a local charity which will offer targeted help to those most in need, especially over the winter period. The scheme will be launched in the coming weeks and will go live around the same time as the increase we announced today takes effect.

Keynote speaker at the event, Athletics NI President, Gerry Carson, said: “Indeed, since Jason won his first sprint title at Beijing in , he has the distinction of never having been beaten in a career which so far has seen him compete in four Paralympics Games.” Jason does not just win gold medals, he continued “He sets records galore.

EUROSPAR Rossdowney champions a number of local suppliers in the North West area, from in-store florist Wild Berry Boutique to Higgins  Sons Family Butchers and McDaid’s Bakery with their famous burnt buns. The supermarket has also been developed with the local shoppers’ specic missions in mind – to pick up fresh, local food-to-go for now, and groceries for later. EUROSPAR Rossdowney is also the first home of the new Nourish deli, offering a nutritious selection of bowls, wraps and smoothies throughout the day. The concept has been created by Henderson Retail to offer shoppers even more choice from their popular food-to-go counters. Mark McCammond, retail director at Henderson Group, said the store represented all that was great and good about the local area. He added: “The people of the Waterside area are what makes it, and the local links for the new EUROSPAR Rossdowney store are second to none. “Not only do we have a team that has served the local community for decades, but we also have extensive ranges of products sourced from local suppliers which keep our food miles down. “We have researched the local shopper demographic extensively, so this store has been built with what they’re looking for directly in mind – fresh, locally produced ingredients for tonight’s tea, and on-site options, made fresh in-store for now.” Store manager, Keith Wilson, has been in charge throughout the build, and said the addition of  parking spaces, a two-pump MAXOL forecourt featuring regular grades and new % carbon offset Premium fuel grades, and a host of additional services on site made it the most convenient site in town. He added: “Shoppers can expect a wide range of services in-store including the Post Office and the extended range of products available from the butchery counter, alongside the first ever Nourish deli counter and all-new Barista Bar coffee, now serving flat whites and luxury hot chocolate and all the Barista coffee favourites. “Local is at the heart of everything we do, from our North West supplier roster which features Limavady’s Milgro and Broighter Gold, Derry’s Doherty Meats, Bonds Potatoes and McDaid’s Bakery alongside Coleraine’s Scott’s Crispy Onions and our top-class butchery serve over from Higgins Family Butchers in Castlerock. “We also have The CHEF range of home-cooked, pre-prepared meals which have recently been awarded Great Taste Awards. Our staff are all friendly faces, well-known and trusted in the area and our shoppers know they will be getting the best range, choice and value in-store.”  Bernie Friars, Lesley Ann Curry, Joyce Logan-Wilson, Grainne McLaughlin, Tina McElhinney, who have over  years of EUROSPAR experience between them, declare the all-new EUROSPAR Rossdowney officially open.  Over , big brand products have been price matched to Tesco, bringing even more value at a local level.

Her family said they are incredibly proud of Ava for using her own birthday to raise money and help other children.Ava even decided to have her birthday cake made with the charity’s colours. Her proud mum, Becky McEvoy, said: “The idea came about by me explaining to her that there are children who dont have any hair due to dferent types of sicknesses and their treatments. “I then showed her The Little Princess Trust’s Instagram posts and she automatically said Mammy, can I do that  I want to help boys and girls have beautul hair like mine.’ “Of course, it was no surprise to me, her daddy and the rest of our family. Ava is such a loving, kind and caring little girl that it is just in her nature to help others. “Ava was due to have her hair trimmed when I spoke to her about it so she already had about nine inches of donatable hair but we hoped that Ava would have - inches as she had only decided in the August and her birthday was on November . “My sister, Ava’s aunty Cheryl, set up a Just Giving page to raise money for the charity and we had originally set a target of pound to help the charity with the cost of turning Ava’s hair into a wig for a young person.” Ava has since smashed this target and has raised over pound between the fundraising page and cash donations from family, friends, her primary school and Irish dancing school. Becky continued: “We asked Courtney, at local hairdressers, Hair by CC, to cut Ava’s hair the day after her birthday. “Once Courtney had cut Ava’shair,she jumped up to go look in the mirror and check out her new hairstyle and of course loved it. “Every morning she gets up and looks in the mirror and says Mammy, I just love my new hair. “As her Mammy, I am incredibly proud of Ava, so is her daddy and the rest of her family. Ava is just an inspiration to everyone. “We cant thank everyone enough who was able to donate to help her help a young person feel like themselves again. “Ava has a younger brother who is ten months old and we cant wait until he grows up a bit so we can explain to him how incredible his big sister is.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jamie McGonigle celebrates the first of two goals.

Her family said they are incredibly proud of Ava for using her own birthday to raise money and help other children.Ava even decided to have her birthday cake made with the charity’s colours. Her proud mum, Becky McEvoy, said: “The idea came about by me explaining to her that there are children who dont have any hair due to dferent types of sicknesses and their treatments. “I then showed her The Little Princess Trust’s Instagram posts and she automatically said Mammy, can I do that  I want to help boys and girls have beautul hair like mine.’ “Of course, it was no surprise to me, her daddy and the rest of our family. Ava is such a loving, kind and caring little girl that it is just in her nature to help others. “Ava was due to have her hair trimmed when I spoke to her about it so she already had about nine inches of donatable hair but we hoped that Ava would have - inches as she had only decided in the August and her birthday was on November . “My sister, Ava’s aunty Cheryl, set up a Just Giving page to raise money for the charity and we had originally set a target of pound to help the charity with the cost of turning Ava’s hair into a wig for a young person.” Ava has since smashed this target and has raised over pound between the fundraising page and cash donations from family, friends, her primary school and Irish dancing school. Becky continued: “We asked Courtney, at local hairdressers, Hair by CC, to cut Ava’s hair the day after her birthday. “Once Courtney had cut Ava’shair,she jumped up to go look in the mirror and check out her new hairstyle and of course loved it. “Every morning she gets up and looks in the mirror and says Mammy, I just love my new hair. “As her Mammy, I am incredibly proud of Ava, so is her daddy and the rest of her family. Ava is just an inspiration to everyone. “We cant thank everyone enough who was able to donate to help her help a young person feel like themselves again. “Ava has a younger brother who is ten months old and we cant wait until he grows up a bit so we can explain to him how incredible his big sister is.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jamie McGonigle celebrates the first of two goals.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jamie McGonigle celebrates the first of two goals.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jamie McGonigle celebrates the first of two goals.

The department confirmed that traffic attendants will be deployed to the area and work is ongoing to extend parkin at the former Foyle College pitch area. Mr Durkan said: “The saga of inconsiderate often dangerous parking along the Duncreggan Road has been a bugbear for many over the years and is an issue which I’ve pushed to resolve. “The area in the vicinity of Magee University is a direct route into the city centre and is extremely busy throughout the week. “Both university staff and students regularly use the Duncreggan Road for parking. However, it is clear that parking is causing a great deal of disruption for residents, motorists and pedestrians alike. “Residents have complained that some iniduals parking in the area often block the entrance to their driveways, preventing them from leaving their homes. “In addition, this is a long established residential area with a majority of elderly residents health and safety concerns have been raised that the area is completely inaccessible for emergency services during the day. “I’m pleased that steps are now being taken by the department to employ more traffic wardens to the area and that Magee are working to extend parking provision in the area. I have also asked Roads Service to consider implementing additional measures, including double yellow lines.” A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: “Occupancy figures for theCampus car park show that there has only been one day since term began that the University’s car park has been over subscribed. We are aware that some iniduals choose to park irresponsibly in the area, and we have recently advised all staff and students to park legally and considerately and reiterated that parking permits are available to provide them with an affordable means to park conveniently and safely on campus. We have recently increased car parking capacity and we also continue to work closely with the Council, PSNI and local Residents Association and we understand that they are communicating considerate parking messages to the general public who may also park in the area to travel to work.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jamie McGonigle celebrates the first of two goals.

In a separate ballot askingmembers would be in favour of industrial action other than walking out on strike, . per cent of Ulster Universitys union members voted a resounding yes. Queens University in Belfast saw resounding majorities for both ballots as well with the national UK average for all UCU members being . per cent in favour of strike action with . per cent in favour of action other than a walkout. The dispute is over pay and working conditions. The UCU have demanded a national yearly pay rise of pound for all staff as well as an end to race, gender and disability pay injustice a framework to eliminate zero-hours and other casualised contracts and meaningful action to tackle unmanageable workloads. A date for strike action for the Ulster University campuses at Magee College, Coleraine and Jordanstown has yet to be set as negotiations that may prevent a walkout are expected to take place. Cllr Shaun Harkin said: “University bosses need to take stock of the resounding vote by lecturers and staff for strike action over pay, conditions and pensions. “People Before Profit send our solidarity to lecturers and staff at  universities, including Ulster University and Queens, following their overwhelming declaration for strike action over pay, working conditions and pensions. People Before Profit fully back the UCUs demands. Wages of university staff has fallen  per cent in real terms since . “A recently published report documented a widespread workload and mental health crisis in universities. Nearly a third of staff say they feel emotionally drained from work pressure. “University bosses are acting no dferently from private sector bosses. This is about turning universities and education into factories for profit. A university shouldnt be run like a corporation focused primarily on churning out profit. “Cancellation of classes will be entirely down to the belligerence and arrogance of university bosses and their disregard for workers and students. “Cynical university bosses will look for any opportunity to ide and conquer by pitting students against staff. “It needs to be remembered that university bosses didnt lt a finger to help students or staff during the pandemic. This is why solidarity between lecturers, staff and students is key. “We encourage all students to join and support the newly formed Students Supporting Industrial Action network. Well do everything we can to back the demands of lecturers and staff. “Across every sector of society employers and government are attempting to put the burden of the pandemic onto the shoulders of workers and the least well-off. The most effective way to respond is with people power resistance and solidarity.” UCU general secretary Jo Grady added: “This result is a clear vote of no confidence in the so-called leaders of our universities, with staff telling them in no uncertain terms that they have had enough of pay and working conditions being run into the ground. “UCU members have yet again beaten the Tory anti-union laws. Alongside our pension ballot result, this means we have a big mandate to take strike action, at a time of our choosing. “It is scandalous that university vice-chancellors on overinflated salaries seem to think doing nothing on pay, casualisation and inequality is acceptable in a sector awash with money. “We truly hope that disruption can be avoided, that is what staff and students alike all want. But this is entirely in the gt of employers who simply need to end their attacks on pensions, pay and working conditions and finally demonstrate they value their staff.” Ulster University has been approached for comment.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jamie McGonigle celebrates the first of two goals.

In addition to pre-loved quality toys, the charity is also keen to receive donations of unused toys and games, which often prove popular in the run up to Christmas when customers are looking for presents at reasonable prices. Unused toiletries that can be used as gts for teenagers are also popular in Barnardo’s shops, as well as the usual clothing and accessory donations that the charity welcomes all year round. Paula Flood, Area Business Manager for Barnardo’s Retail in Northern Ireland said: “With preparations for Christmas getting underway, this is the time of year many people need to make space for new toys and gts, so we are asking them to keep Barnardo’s in mind and donate any of their good quality pre-loved toys, or clothes, to our charity’s shops. “It’s amazing what people unearth when they start looking in the back of cupboards and at the bottom of the toybox. “It’s a great way to clear out any toys or clothes your children and grandchildren no longer play with or wear, as well as any pre-loved clothes you are not wearing. We’re particularly keen to receive any ‘winter woolly’ type items that we can sell over the coming months. “The donated items will help to raise funds for work carried out to support local children and families who need a little bit of extra help. “We’d like to thank all of our customers and donors for their continued support, which really does make a dference to so many local children’s lives.” Any donations will be received at your local Barnardo’s store at their branches in Shipquay Street and Bishops Street, Derry.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jamie McGonigle celebrates the first of two goals.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big. urdquo u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over  upound. uc p ue r n ucp ueManus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. u uc p ue r n ucp ueTwo versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute  ulsquoshort version ursquo by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board. uc p ue r n ucp ue ucspan style ud \"color: #ff \" ue ucstrong ueClick the Next ugt tab to go through the gallery uc strong ue uc span ue uc p ue r n ucp ue[articlepreview id ud \" \" link ud \"https:www.derrynow video multimedia  watch-the-story-of-the-undertones-.html \"] uc p ue r n uc  ue r n uc  ue r n uc class ud \"vc_story_telling \" data-position ud \" \" data-story ud \" \" ue r n ucp class ud \"vc_story_telling_title \" ue u uc p ue r n uc class ud \"vc_story_telling_text \" ue r n ucp ue ucspan style ud \"color: #ff \" ue ucstrong ueThe Undertones Premier. . .

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jamie McGonigle celebrates the first of two goals.

When he took the Glen managerial post, there was only one target in his mind – to repeat the feat he managed  years previous with The Loup. He inherited a side that knew they were close but were reeling from a  final defeat against Magherafelt and then a quarter-final exit last year at the hands of the eventual champions, Slaughtneil. The only word for their campaign leading to Sunday was dominance. But this one was the acid test. Were they now ready to make that last step  “The boys put in serious hard work from the start of the year, and I suppose we all dreamt of a day like this that we could get over the line,” said the former Monaghan manager. “When you see how much it means to so many people, it’s a great feeling. We worked hard all year and the boys really put their shoulder to the wheel. “They were determined thatthey got the chance again that they were going to grab it, and I suppose that’s what they did.” As the championship ticked on, O’Rourke’s men only became more scintillating, free-flowing and relentless. A - to - semi-final victory over The Loup sent the loudest of warning signs. They were gearing up for a battle. “We felt that the boys were going well. They were training hard and they were really focused,” he explained.  “We had a good win in the semi-final but we always felt that there was more and we knew we would have to have more because of the tremendous experience that Slaughtneil have and their ability to win games. We knew we had to put in a big performance. “We started the game very well and I suppose we never let go of that stranglehold we got at the start. It was a great performance and I’m delighted to get through it.” The men in green and gold looked sharp from the get go, holding Slaughtneil to just one point in the opening half. Leading - to - ticking into the final seconds before the break, a lovely move involving Tiarnan Flanagan and Conor Glass was finished off by Danny Tallon to the net. It was the ultimate sucker punch. “Our display in the first half maybe merited being another couple of points in front, but we kicked a couple of wides so that goal gave us that buffer that was crucial at half-time. “I suppose it meant thatwe just kept our heads in the second half and played controlled football then it was always going to be hard for them to get back into it, and that’s how it turned out.” For Glen it may turn out that county championships are like buses – you wait so long for one then suddenly many come along. The age profile of this team and the frightening levels of talent would certainly indicate it. But for their manager, there’s no complacency, be it the upcoming Ulster campaign or the years to come. “Derry football is very strong and you can never look too far ahead. I’m just delighted to get through today and delighted to get the first championship for the club. “A lot will depend on the next couple of weeks and how the boys get on. We’ll not be putting any handbrake on them for the immediate future – we’ll let them enjoy it because that’s a big part of football as well. “We’ll assess things at the end of the week and see how we’re going, but we’ll enjoy this one.”  WATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final  St Mary’s PS Glenview has a number of past pupils involved in Slaughtneil v Glen.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Sligo Rovers  googletag.cmd.push  Jamie McGonigle downed Sligo Rovers with two fantastic goals as Derry City comfortably won their last home game of the season. The striker struck either side of half time, with quality finishes to add to keep City’s hopesEuropean qualication alive ahead of the final game at Dundalk.  A peach of a finish from the striker gave City the lead on  minutes. The goal was reward for a positive start from the home side as Joe Thomson set up McGonigle, wh sent a superb left-footed volley past Richard Brush and into the net to make it -. Liam Buckley could not have been happy with his team at all in a one-sided first half, but his mood almost improved when Sligo created their first chance on  minutes, Mark Byrne breaking into the Derry penalty area, but his low effort was parried by Nathan Gartside who stopped the shot with a strong right hand. Gartside came to Derry’s rescue with an even better save five minutes later. Sligo were pushing hard for an equaliser before half time and they very nearly got it when Walter Figueira’s corner found the run of Garry Buckley at the back post, but the defender’s downward header was brilliantly stopped by the City goalkeeper. For all that Sligo pressure, it should have been - Derry City at the break, as McGonigle was able to race completely free through on goal. The striker showed tremendous poise as he dinked the ball over the oncoming Brush, but Lewis Bank was there to stop the ball on the line, much to the disbelief of the City fans. Lewis Banks then performed more heroics at the other end when Brush was caught in no man’s land trying to challenge Akintunde in the air before McGonigle rounded him and got away a strike that was denied on the line by the right back. Derry eventually doubled their lead in sensational fashion on  minutes. Will Fitzgerald ran at the Sligo defence and crossed the ball, only for Garry Buckley to head it away. The ball fell out of the sky straight onto the foot of McGonigle who lashed it powerfully beyond Brush and onto the top corner for -.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Sligo Rovers  googletag.cmd.push  Jamie McGonigle downed Sligo Rovers with two fantastic goals as Derry City comfortably won their last home game of the season. The striker struck either side of half time, with quality finishes to add to keep City’s hopesEuropean qualication alive ahead of the final game at Dundalk.  A peach of a finish from the striker gave City the lead on  minutes. The goal was reward for a positive start from the home side as Joe Thomson set up McGonigle, wh sent a superb left-footed volley past Richard Brush and into the net to make it -. Liam Buckley could not have been happy with his team at all in a one-sided first half, but his mood almost improved when Sligo created their first chance on  minutes, Mark Byrne breaking into the Derry penalty area, but his low effort was parried by Nathan Gartside who stopped the shot with a strong right hand. Gartside came to Derry’s rescue with an even better save five minutes later. Sligo were pushing hard for an equaliser before half time and they very nearly got it when Walter Figueira’s corner found the run of Garry Buckley at the back post, but the defender’s downward header was brilliantly stopped by the City goalkeeper. For all that Sligo pressure, it should have been - Derry City at the break, as McGonigle was able to race completely free through on goal. The striker showed tremendous poise as he dinked the ball over the oncoming Brush, but Lewis Bank was there to stop the ball on the line, much to the disbelief of the City fans. Lewis Banks then performed more heroics at the other end when Brush was caught in no man’s land trying to challenge Akintunde in the air before McGonigle rounded him and got away a strike that was denied on the line by the right back. Derry eventually doubled their lead in sensational fashion on  minutes. Will Fitzgerald ran at the Sligo defence and crossed the ball, only for Garry Buckley to head it away. The ball fell out of the sky straight onto the foot of McGonigle who lashed it powerfully beyond Brush and onto the top corner for -.

Probably not like. Anyway. For those not familiar and familiar with the process Aaron Cunningham, deputy editor at Chordblossom Addison Paterson, Alastair Simpson, Andrew Lemon, The Thin Air Brendan McKeown, Mr Brian Coney, editor at The Thin Air, Chris Corrigan, head of music Queens University Belfast, Carolyn Mathers, Director of Snow Water middot Christopher McBride, Ciara McMullan, photographer Erika Clarke, Chris Flack, Colin Harper, Colum Fitzsimons, David Roy, Dan Hegarty, Davy Sims, Rachael Campbell Palmer, director Black Box, Dolores Vischer, Monk, Edwin McFee, journalist Gerry Sheppard, Hannah Anderson, Hannah Gibson, Mark Hornby, James Ayo, Robert Brown, Editor at Chordblossom middot John DArcy, Jamie Taylor, beautul Everton fan, Janis Leaden, Amy Nolan, Jimmy Devlin, Joe Dougan, Johanna Leech, Jonathan Stewart, Josh Henry, Jo Wright, Kate Barry, Keely, Keith Millar, Me, Les Hume, Lisa Flavelle, Dylan Murphy and Jack Rapanakis, Mari Jackson, Mark Millar, Brendan McGoran, Meghan Gilleece, Thee Micky Ferry, Thee Nance Hall, Nattassa Latcham, Niall Byrne, Olga Kaye, Patricia McConville, Paddy Craig, Music Peter Cinnamond, Phil McCarroll, Ralph McClean, Roisin McNickle, Rory McConnell, Ruth McCarthy, Sara Champ, Sarah Kiely, Sean Kelly, Sean McCann, Simon Oliver, Siobhan McAndrew, Stephen McCaulay of the wonderful taste, handsome Stevie Lennox, Steve Stockman, Stuart Fletcher, Stuart Bailie obviously, Geoff Topley, Thomas Camblin and Saul Duffin have decided that Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic, Arvo Party’s Inheritance, Bicep’s Isles, CATALAN!’s Veritas, Danni Larkin’s Notes For A Maiden Warrior, Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave, Jealous Of The Birds’ Peninsula, Joshua Burnside’s Into The Depths Of Hell, New Pagans’s The Seed The Vessel The Roots And All, Peter J McCauley’s Amnesty, Saint Sister’s Where I Should End, This Ship Argo’s Always The Bees Never The Honey, TRUacute’s No Fixed Abode and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won have all been nominated for the best album at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and Amy Montgomery’sIntangible, Bicep’smiddot Apricots, Cherym’sListening To My Head, Dea Matrona’sStamp On It, Enola Gay’sSofa Surfing, Invaderband’sI Wont Remember You, Jordan Adetunji’s Wokeup! and Waldorf  Cannon’sWe Are Your Governmenthave been nominated for best single at event. There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse.

The area will also be power washed.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange.New safety railings are to be installed outside  Church Street, while a mural will be painted on one of the gable walls at the entrance to the car park at this part of the town.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Plans have also been outlined to provide new festive lighting on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.The draft plan confirms a proposal to appoint a quantity surveyor to oversee the substantial investment with hopes that the work can start as soon as the document secures approval from the steering group.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the opportunity business and property owners are being given to revitalise what he described as a key part of the town.ldquoThe proposed Church Street investment is welcome news in a part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses whose links with Downpatrick stretch back over several generations, he said.ldquoThe draft plan provides a vision for the future and business owners welcome the signicant investment which will considerably help Church Street which has missed out on funding for some considerable time.Cllr Curran said the revitalisation scheme provided a firm  on which to build for the future and he hoped that business and property owners will be encouraged to spend some of their own money on their respective properties to make them even better.He is also keen to see progress on the Irish Street scheme which has not made the progress many would have hoped by this stage.Cllr Curran added: ldquoRedeveloping the former police base site and neighbouring properties will be a game-changer and act as a catalyst to secure more investment, increasing footfall which will benefit existing traders.ldquoDownpatrick is a county town and its status warrants not only a vibrant retail hub, but a place where all buildings look smart and welcoming.ldquoSignicant sums of money have been invested in other town centre streets and I am delighted that it is now Church Streetrsquos turn to benefit from some much-needed, but very welcome investment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin make history  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN were crowned junior champions for the first time in their  year history after a pulsating contest with Dundrum concluded in a three-point victory at Pairc Esler on Friday night.Despite a commendable second half surge from John Clarkersquos Dundrum men, the lsquoFin showed their experience in the competition and managed to cling on to achieve intermediate status for next yearrsquos campaign.Dundrum began on the offence straight from the start, winning the throw-in and immediately attacking the opposition.This set the tone for what would be a highly paced and energetic contest, as Aughlisnafinrsquos Oran Flanagan fouled Dundrumrsquos Michael McGrattan for a free within the opening minute.However, what should have been a straight forward conversion was missed by Cormac Venney.Breannain McComiskey immediately made Venney rue his miss, as the Aughlisnafin man kicked over the bar following good build-up play from Shea Croskery for the opening score of the final.The lsquoFin kept their foot on the pedal and won the following kick-out, with Flanagan making up for his earlier foul to convert a point from play.Referee Conor Curran was kept busy throughout the game and first brandished his yellow card just four minutes in to Aughlisnafinrsquos Noel Travers after a sloppy high tackle.Following patient build up play, Croskery added his sidersquos third point of the game, with Dundrum now desperate to get on the board.It was clear nerves were playing a part in the early stages, as Venney failed to convert another free wide, this time dragging his shot right of the posts.With Aughlisnafin piling the pressure on the Dundrum defence the ball was worked back to lsquokeeper Walsh who played a fist pass out to team-mate Thomas McShane  metres from goal.However, disaster struck as the Dundrum man fumbled the ball in the danger area, allowing Flanagan to pick up the scraps and bury the ball into the back of the net to give The lsquoFin a six point lead less than ten minutes in.Michael McGrattan tried to answer for Dundrum but saw his effort drt wide before custodian Walsh finally got his side off the mark with a converted free.McComiskey replied sharply, notching his second point by kicking over the black spot from open play, although Venney did answer this with a point of his own that he desperately needed just before the water-break.At the conclusion of the opening quarter, Aughlisnafin were by far the dominant side and led - to -.On the restart Dundrum managed to find their groove and make up for earlier mistakes courtesy of successive points from Venney and McGrattan.However, Aughlisnafin would soon hit their opponents with a damaging blow as Tiernan Noadersquos high ball over the top found lsquoFin forward Adam Garland, who converted his sweetly struck shot into the top left corner for the second goal of the game after  minutes.Noade won a turnover from the resultant kick-out, but saw his effort sail wide before McGrattan replied with a point for Dundrum after winning an inidual battle with Aughlisnafin defender Sean Fitzsimmons.The contest was beginning to ebb and flow with both sets of supporters making their voices heard, as Garland dummied his man, but missed the target.Despite Noade pulling his shot wide a minute later, Aughlisnafinrsquos high balls over the top were clearly causing Dundrum all sorts of bother as their defence struggled to maintain the pressing forward line.Garland kicked over a free to give his side a - score line as Dundrum prepared to introduce substitute Odhran McKibbin to the pitch.Perhaps overeager to impress, McKibbin received a yellow card immediately following a late tackle, as referee Curran continued to show efficient officiating beyond his years.Soon after, McComiskey registered his third point of the match, but once again, Dundrum showed why they made it to the final.After overturning the ball in midfield, the ball worked its way to Dundrum captain Aidan Fegan, who played a lovely pass over the top to McGrattan.The forward found himself in acres of space and struck the ball with conviction past lsquoFin lsquokeeper Morgan Croskery and into the net.Garland replied with a free just before half time as the score read Aughlisnafin - Dundrum -.The lsquoFin began the quicker following the restart after a McComiskey lsquorsquo floated into Garland, who pointed over for the first score of the half.A series of wides took up the next five minutes of the game before McComiskey became the latest player to enter Conor Curranrsquos book, receiving a yellow for a high tackle.Travers then pulled his effort wide before his side won the resultant kick-out and forced a fantastic save from Dundrumrsquos Walsh, who stopped a certain goal.Walsh found himself at the opposite end of the pitch a minute later to kick over a fantastic free, which spurred team-mate Venney on to convert one himself in the following passage of play.This was Venneyrsquos third time raising the white flag and the last notable piece of action before the second water-break as Dundrum trailed by four.The last quarter was nothing short of dramatic, as both sets of players were clearly beginning to fatigue and yet still managed to throw everything at eachother.Dundrum really set the scene for a nail-biting last  minutes when they passed the ball neatly from one end of the pitch to the other before skipper Fegan found David McComiskey with only lsquokeeper Croskery to beat.Dundrumrsquos McComiskey duly converted make it a one-point game and now the atmosphere was beginning to reach fever pitch.John Hurley saw his chance sail wide for Dundrum before Garland kicked over a free to double his sidersquos lead.McGrattan continued to battle, winning a free out of nothing, before Walsh stepped up to send the ball over the bar.Shea Croskery received a yellow card in between two wide balls from Dundrum, as they resulted to kicking from range in the final five minutes.Walsh was forced to make another eye-catching save, this time preventing substitute Ruairi Croskery from converting.Garland managed to kick over a point a minute later to add to his impressive personal tally before Flanagan saw his long range effort split the posts to give Aughlisnafin a comfortable three point margin.With just seconds on the clock, Dundrum knew it was now or never and with the last free of the night attempted a short pass to allow an opportunity for a strike on goal.However, Shea Croskery was on hand to block the shot as Curranrsquos whistle sounded for the final time to signal it would be Dolen Croskeryrsquos men who would lt the trophy.Aughlisnafin: M Croskery J Matthews, S Fitzsimmons, S Willoughby O OrsquoToole, B McComiskey , N Travers D Steele , O FlanaganS

Tyrella passed the stringent tests for the seventh successive year.Announcing the disappointing news for Newcastle, Environment Minister, Sam Foster, said the failure of the three beaches was due to sewage dischargers, which he added highlights the problems caused by the lack of investment in sewerage services.However, the Water Service yesterday stressed that it was unlikely the discovery was due to the failure of the multi-million pound sewage treatment plant which was built at the townrsquos harbour in the s.A Water Service spokesman said there has been no failure at the sewage plant since  and it is therefore questionable that it is the source of the problem.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Development Association will be unveiling its latest regeneration scheme at the end of the month.The official ceremony will be performed by former Down councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, who will be joined by a number of people from the town and representatives from the International Fund for Ireland.Work on the High Street project started in January and was completed in September and has transformed the area, with the ambitious pound, project including four ground floor shops, two first floor apartments and a cottage.The cottage has recently been sold and the four retail units are currently available for rental with Association officials confident they can secure tenants.Construction work began at the start of the year and the project team behind the scheme are confident the scheme will greatly enhance this area of Killyleagh which is close to the townrsquos historic castle.CASTLWELLAN mdash Elderly people in Castlwellan are being disturbed by children running through their gardens, according to the local SDLP branch.During a recent meeting of the Castlewellan and Kilcoo branch, the chairman, John Duggan, said he was concerned that some older residents were being bothered by a number of young people.Mr Duggan pointed out that Castlewellan was an excellent place to live but said there was an absolute need for children to pay courtesy to their elders within the neighbourhood.ldquoWhat makes a good community spirit is the ability to have respect for others within the community.

Catherine OrsquoConnor was in fineform and led the EDAC ladies in style.Her aim was top ten and she managed that with ease coming eighth in . for the three miles. She also got the prize for first over  as a further boost to her confidence.Leanne Spick, who has only recently joined the club, is a competent runner and game for anything so, new spikes purchased, she turned up to see what was what.She was second EDAC lady home, th overall in ..

There were nine EDAC representatives, a mix of the experienced and the first timers ready for the five laprace.Gordy Graham prefers the feel of tarmac when he is racing, but he aways commits to whatever challenge is set before him. He, like Catherine, was aiming for a top ten and by virtue of targeting runners ahead hemanoeuvred himself into a good position but had to sprintright to the line to hold his tenth place.He recorded . which is speedy for an off road run.Mackenzie Murray is  but with no junior category for this age, he decided to join in the menrsquos senior team and he proved a useful addition.He found the distance long and at one stage was doubting his ability to stay with the pace but he hung in and even passed more runners to finish th overall in a time of ..Martin Willcox loves cross country, as does Dee Murray, and as old hands they know that pacing is key.They went lap after lap, never showing the strain and finishing in . and . respectively, th and nd.Right behind Dee was Jonny Holmes.

Both distances started at the Mary Peters Track and then headed off into the forest and then along the towpath.There were over  in the K and  in the K. East Down had two runners both doing the K, Sharon Madine and Rachel Madine .Despite her birthday celebrations the night before, Sharon looked fresh as she set off with the lead pack and she was more than able to stick with the pace throughout.While she didnrsquot particularly relish the hill at the start or the climb to the finish, she appreciated the scenery en route.Her efforts placed her third female at the finish and it is worth noting that her time of . was only a few seconds off second place.Rachel equally enjoyed both the route and the race and was pleased to come well up the field in nd place .For Rachel though, this was only part one of her weekend commitments.The annual event organised by Atlas Running on behalf of the Ballynahinch British Legion took place on Sunday morning with a K route along the back roads of the town.Even though she had already raced the day before, Rachel Madine felt that she couldnrsquot let this race go by without taking part as it is right on her doorstep.In fact she could be considered a regular as this is her third time enteringThe  odd runners who turned up were delighted to be greeted with pleasant, bright weather as last year they had to endure torrential rain and high winds.Despite the hilly course, the race was won in a speedy . by Lawrence OrsquoHara of North Belfast.

A good weekendrsquos work for her.It was cross country all the way for the EDAC juniors last weekend but one option was closer to home in Ballyclare while the other necessitated a long drive to Donegal.The home birds were running in the U- race prior to the McConnell Shield cross country in the Six Mile Water Park. It may only have been a mile but it was a tough mile.Matthew Taylor actually ran more than a mile as he arrived late thinking he was in the next race on the program and performed the quickest vest change and number putting on ever seen.He just made it to the back of the pack as the whistle blew. Undeterred he dug in and made his way through the small pack and was barely in his stride when he realised that it was time to sprint for the finish line.He couldnrsquot believe his luck when he was then handed a medal for second boy. Talk about a whirlwind experience - maybe the lack of time to consider what lay ahead was a good thing.Even though he had no time to greet them at the start, he was able to congratulate the two other EDAC runners at the end.Amelia Spick was taking on her first cross country ever and seemed to enjoy the race. Her new spikes are now duly christened and hopefully she willfor another shot at this discipline.She ran an even pace as advised and finished sixth girl and ninth overall. Ky Murray was two places behind and closing in the latter stages.Her lightning sprint brought her within five seconds of Amelia and she was placed eighth girl overall.The juniors then took on the role of supporters, cheering on the adults which was much appreciated encouragement. It is this element of whole club camaraderie that makes cross country so special.Further afield then were the Robinson brothers who had travelled to Stranorlar in Donegal for the NI and Ulster XC Championships .Despite some rain early on in Ballyclare, the athletes raced in dry, almost sunny conditions and there was very little mud to slow them down, but Oliver and Alex were not so lucky.The rain the night before made the course very boggy and although the rainbows on the day suggested it might clear, this was just a tease. Even during the dry spells the biting wind made conditions tough for the runners.Alex was first up running a distance of two kilometres in the U- race. He started safely and quickly became part of the leading pack on the course two loops around two fields.On the second lap he led the breakaway pack and looked comfortable as they disappeared into the second field.When he emerged he had ped to fth and was running with just one shoe having lost the other in the deep mud. The last m metres were heroic as he battled to hold his place only being overtaken in the last m.He was so disappointed with the outcome and on reflection said he should have ditched his shoe sooner instead of losing speed trying to keep it on.A hard lesson to learn but Alex showed his grit and has been rewarded with selection as an inidual into the U- Ulster and NI team for the All-Irelands in Gowran, Kilkenny at the start of December.He was placed sixth out of  runners in a time of ., only  seconds behind the winner. The wayward shoe was retrieved from the mud later.His brother Ollie was in two minds whether to run at all. He was nursing an injury acquired at rugby but he showed commitment by putting his vest on to line up for the U- four-and-a-half kilometre race.He knew he wasnrsquot at his best but didnrsquot want to withdraw without giving it a shot. He went out steadily, wisely treating it as a training run, but still finishing rd out of the field of  runners.When the times are analysed he may well end up at the All-Irelands as part of the county team. Either way, he did the club proud and both boys are to be congratulated on their efforts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Make the Call helps families with £5m aid  ","story":"NEW figures have revealed that over , people across the Newry Mourne and Down area claimed almost poundm in unclaimed benefits last year.The cash was paid under the lsquomake the callrsquo scheme spearheaded by the Department for Communities.The government department said figures for the last financial year reveal that people who used the service became pound better off per week on average, with almost , accessing almost poundm in unclaimed benefits province-wide.The lsquomake the callrsquo service supports people in accessing benefits, services and supports to which they are entitled, but have not been claiming.A total of  people in Newry Mourne and Down claimed pound,, last year.Stormont communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, said her departmentrsquos scheme has helped people who lsquomade the callrsquo become, on average, pound. better off per week.ldquoDuring  , we received over  referrals from our partner organisations which helped ensure people are receiving their full entitlement to benefits, supports and services that can make a real dference to their lives, she explained.ldquoOften people donrsquot realise there is support out there to assist them during dficult times.

Enough is enough, it is time to see these projects delivered to improve the lives of local workers and families.With the approach of winter and worsening road conditions due to weather and darker evenings, Cllr Mason said visibility will become poorer.ldquoWe need to see urgent action from the Minister to address the concerns of the local community to ensure our roads are safe and up to satisfactory standard before winter hits, she contended.ldquoWinter gritting is a huge cause for concern for many in our local rural communities and the Minister needs to deliver a more effective solution to winter gritting on our rural roads with priority for those in more isolated areas who fear another winter stuck in their homes, the councillor continued.ldquoMany farmers who rely on milk collection lorries arriving daily and accessing feed supplies for their animals, need the certainty that their services and routine will not be disrupted. Those who work as frontline staff such as the emergency services and domiciliary care workers must have a safe passage to and from peoplersquos homes, while childcare services and rural schools must be able to operate smoothly.ldquoWe cannot allow ordinary people to suffer and a management plan must be implemented to ensure gritting is carried out throughout the winter period, she added, confirming that she has written to Mrs Mallon to raise her concerns.A DfI spokesman said Mrs Mallon ldquocompletely rejects these unfounded assertions and will continue to work equitably across all council areas, including South Down, to improve the condition of the road network.ldquoThe Minister is fully aware of the condition of roads in South Down and will continue to work for all communities to deliver the infrastructure they need, he said.ldquoThe fact that the Minister has increased the funding for the rural roads fund by % and allocated poundm mdash a % increase on last yearrsquos budget mdash specically for rural roads across the North, including South Down, is a clear demonstration of this commitment to rural communities. This funding is not impacted by current legal challenges.The spokesman explained that as a result of challenges to awarding resurfacing contracts earlier this year, ious schemes which the Department had intended to progress during the current financial year have been delayed in four council areas, including Newry Mourne and Down.But he confirmed the Department is taking forward a new procurement strategy and hopes to be in position to go to tender shortly and to have new term contracts in place next January to continue resurfacing programmes in these areas, including in South Down.ldquoSignicant programmes of work have been delivered across all areas in  , in particular on rural roads and while capacity to reallocate resurfacing budgets across areas is limited, every effort is being made to maximise spend across all areas, said the spokesman.ldquoIn relation to the Ballynahinch bypass, Minister Mallon provided an opening allocation of pound.m for land costs and scheme development in -. The next steps are procurement and progression to construction.ldquoProgression to construction will, however, depend on budget allocations made to the Department in future years. Subject to funding being made available, it is estimated that it would take around  months to the start of construction from any decision to move to procurement, and a further  months to construct the scheme.The spokesman explained that as part of planning for the winter gritting programme, the Department ensures that adequate staff are available, all winter service equipment is in satisfactory working order and that there are adequate supplies of salt.He added: ldquoWhile the Department generally salts the main through routes which carry more than , vehicles per day, in exceptional circumstances, roads with dficult topography carrying between , and , vehicles daily will also be salted.ldquoGrit piles are also available for use by the public on a self-help basis on selected routes not included on the salting schedule and arrangements are in place to enlist the help of private contractors and local farmers to assist in efforts to clear blocked roads in rural areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Multi agency  response call on foul smell  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called for a multi-agency response to two issues of concern in the Dundrum area.Northern Ireland Water, the Department for Infrastructure and Rivers Agency have been asked to address recent damage caused by flood water at the Moneycarragh River, with the utility company and Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos environmental health department asked to investigate the cause of foul smelling liquid seeping from land close to Dam Lane in the village.The appeal for the ious agencies to work together on both issues has been made by Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis.In relation to the Moneycarragh River, the councillor has called for the waterway to be ldquoed to its natural state, with the appeal coming after recent flooding which led to a burst pipe resulting in a number of consumers in the area left without supply.In June, Cllr Lewis raised concerns of local farmers with NI Water after a concrete floor was installed on the floor of the river, directly under Bennettrsquos bridge which runs over it.ldquoThe work prevented water from pooling, which subsequently forced floodwater to erode stone walls and the river bank which exposed a water supply the pipe which was damaged by rocks and it burst, he added.Cllr Lewis claimed rising floodwater has also undermined the integrity of the bridge and widened the river banks which exposed the water supply pipe.ldquoPreviously, farmers were able to drive machinery down the natural land slope to collect water from the river for animals and farm use, but this access has been altered so much that a sizeable dip has been left on the river bank.Cllr Lewis said the damage was ldquopredictable and claimed that the manipulation of the riverrsquos natural flow has, over time, distorted its integrity, warning that erosion which will eventually cause the collapse of the supporting walls at the bridge and adjoining roadway.He has asked NI Water and roads officials to urgently join forces to address the issue andthe river bed to its natural state.Turning to Dam Lane, Cllr Lewis says he hopes local afgghghuthority environmental health officials and NI Water will be able to address the issue.ldquoI recently received numerous complaints regarding a foul smelling fluid which has been seeping onto the pavement at this part of the village. There are suggestions that fluid is coming from a nearby drain or sewer, he explained.Cllr Lewis said that while he is aware that there is a sewage treatment plant nearby, there are no suggestions that the spillage came from it.He added: ldquoIt is in everyonersquos interest to identy what is casing this issue and to recty it as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_kathy.jpg","title":"Newcastle woman Kathy to meet Sir David Attenborough at event  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman will be rubbing shoulders with Sir David Attenborough at a virtual event which will explore ways of ensuring a better future.Kathy Black is taking part in the Festival of Discovery, which begins tomorrow and ends on Saturday.Also joining her in the event, which is being run by the Eden Project, will be comedian John Bishop, best-selling author Ben Miller and BBC gardening presenter Mark Lane.Al of them will be taking part in inspiring sessions about eco-friendly initiatives taking place across the UK.Kathy, who runs Unit T in Newcastle, will be sharing the story of how she and a team of volunteers responded to their local arearsquos needs by opening a sustainable community kitchen during the pandemic.Built from re-purposed materials and located in the heart of the town, Unit T distributes home-grown produce, local goods and food near its sell-by date.As well as providing a vital and sustainable service for the community, Unit T have inspired and involved young people to live within their means and connect with each other and the natural world.The three-day Festival of Discovery is jam-packed with speakers,  and workshops.Tracey Robbins, Head of UK Delivery at Eden Project Communities, said: ldquoWersquore absolutely thrilled to be inviting Kathy to the Festival of Discovery.ldquoHere at Eden Project Communities, we know that there are thousands of amazing people doing their bit to protect the planet by joining forces with their communities and seeing the amazing things that can happen when we work together.ldquoWe canrsquot wait to hear some of their stories and hope that everyone attending will come away feeling inspired and motivated to get together to protect our planet.The Festival of Discovery will take place online.

What does it matterthe Union is secureconcessions to Irish nationalism are so wide-ranging that Northern Ireland is utterly unlike any other part of UK Would it still be part of the UK  etcIt was a fascinating series. By August I was struck by the confidence of essay writers that NI would still be in UK in . They were right. But no-one addressed the possibility of NI being technically in the Union, but so changed as to be halfway to an all-Ireland. I penned the below essay to suggest that coming contributors address that. But I was uneasy expressing a view as then news editor . I was also wary about contradicting the essay writers. After consulting senior colleagues I agreed not to publish it. I do so now because it is  and concerns I raised have even greater relevance now than then. Beneath the article I have add updated thoughts on my points below.THE Union is secure, and will be in , many of our contributors have told us.In the News Letter’s Union  series so far there has been large agreement that the British link will survive past Northern Ireland’s th anniversary.But what does it mean to say that the Union is secure, or indeed what does it matter Those are follow-on questions that have not been so widely considered.What does it matter that the Union has been securedthe concessions to Irish nationalism are so comprehensive and wide-ranging that Northern Ireland in fact looks utterly unlike any other part of the kingdom Some of the following scenarios may seem provocative, but take a moment to imagine them: • A Northern Ireland in which you need a passport to get to Great Britain• A Northern Ireland teeming with powerful enforcers who see discrimination and sectarianism behind all sorts of human failings• A Northern Ireland which is, in terms of its very identity, an enlarged Stroke City, in which the media alternate between using its name Northern Ireland and other labels that deny its existence, such as the north of Ireland• A Northern Ireland that has fiscal powers that remove its economy yet further from the British mainstream• A Northern Ireland in which BBC Radio Ulster is broadcast in gaelic night after night, so that the overwhelming majority of the station’s listeners are unable to understand it during much of evening primetime• A Northern Ireland in which all road signs are jointly in gaelic • A Northern Ireland which toleration of violence in the name of human rights is pushed to the very extremes, providing it is aimed against agents of the state. In which calculated attacks on police, risking paralysis or death, are accepted in preference to a police response involving real force• A Northern Ireland which has a Bill of Rights that includes socio and economic rights, like something out of the old communist Eastern bloc• A Northern Ireland in which there is a growing consensusthat the earlier NI was a failed state• A Northern Ireland in which that coalition agrees that there was widespread collusion – facilitating wholesale murder – between loyalist killers the RUC and British Army • A Northern Ireland in which such assumptions about an entirely malign British form the basis on which the past, or any allegiance to it, is investigated or treated• A Northern Ireland in which those who planned massacres against civilians are not only treated as equals with the British forces, but are able to demand full accountability of those state forces while shamelessly covering up their own history• A Northern Ireland in which the Republic’s president can come and go freely, presiding over official s – a presidency that appears to allow its office-holder to cite political preconditions before the apolitical British head of state can set foot in the Republic [this was before the royal visit of ]• A Northern Ireland in which the Republic’s government can be a partisan player, while demanding neutrality on the part of those who actually have sovereignty• A Northern Ireland which must, necessarily must, include in government a party that the Republic will not tolerate in its own halls of powerTo be clear, imagining these ious scenarios does not mean they likely: as our recent story [published in ] on Northern Irishness pointed out, a large minority of Catholics accept the title and the state.And the Human Rights Commission’s Bill of Rights proposals have been comprehensively rejected by the main GB parties, and received coolly even in the Republic.Further, the Tories under David Cameron have sent out clear “hold on a minute” signals to any assumptions that they must be impartial on matters such as the future of the Union.Meanwhile, there is no suggestion that Northern Ireland will ever lose its Westminster MPs and many unionists, indeed Orangemen, will point to a real change in how they are received south of the border.So it is extreme to assume that all of the scenarios listed above will come to pass. Yet all the scenarios, and more, are at least conceivable within the Union.Some are not hypotheses but the actual position.Andall this could happen within the Union, then the urgent question is – what does the Union matter I raised this question verbally with an interested observer. He responded: ”The subvention perhaps  That may be why it matters.”It sounds convincing to say that the huge subsidy from the Treasury in London is what makes it all worthwhile. After all, that is what makes the province reasonably affluent. But you could just as easily argue that the other way – that the subsidy alongside relentless political concessions means that Irish nationalists within the province can enjoy all of their key demands, and the financial benefit too.One little-noticed, but intriguing, suggestion on the future that would have implications for this anomaly came from a recent writer on our  pages, Garvin Crawford. He suggested the world’s first community state in which people are able to designate themselves as Ulster British or Ulster Irish, and pay taxes and receive benefits accordingly.But, despite its logicality, the idea that those in Northern Ireland who opt for Irish citizenship would lose British benefits would surely provoke uproar amongst Irish nationalists globally.Union  will continue throughout the summer.Perhaps some of the coming contributors will address this question of what a secure Union means, and why it matters.• The essay above was written in August . I am surprised by parts of it, for example my reference to us one day needing a passport to get to Great Britain. There was no prospect of Brexit in , because David Cameron was new to power and had not promised his In-Out vote, but I think the idea was in my head because the Labour government had tried to introduce security measures for cross Irish Sea movements from which it retreated. Also, I had seen or reported on matters such as police sometimes in Belfast airports asking flight passengers from the mainland for a passport, rather than photo ID, and a Tory MP complaining about the same in Dublin in lack of observance of the Common Travel AreaThe sections on legacy above were brewing in  but are far worse now. Also, in  the Irish language push and Bill of Rights push were almost dormant but it was clear they were so central to republican goals that they would arise again.The expanding role of ‘enforcers’ has continued, as it was obvious in  it would.Similarly, the sections on Irish government partisanship, on the Irish presidencyand on contested terms such as Northern Ireland have become much more pronounced since Brexit, but I had forgotten until revisiting this essay the extent to which they were building regardless of the UK’s position in or out of the EU.The double standards in the Dublin establishment with regard to Sinn Fein having to be in power on one side of the border but not being allowed in the other have diminished in recent years as some Irish leaders seem to begin to prepare for striking a deal with them.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor.

He has been a very valuable asset to our union and will be sadly missed.Mr Pricersquos contribution will be acknowledged at the Annual Glamorgan County Dinner that is being held at Cardfrsquos Angel Hotel on Friday November .More than  guests and dignitaries will attend the black-tie dinner, with glasses raised to the Glamorgan first team who beat Devon last month at Long Sutton Golf Club in the final of inter-county league.It had been a long wait since , but the convincing - victory in Somerset - which came after Glamorgan topped their group with just one defeat in the entire season - was the perfect way for Mr Price to bow out of the role.As well as the first team, Price has assisted in running the junior teams and the seniors team. In his time working across these generations, he has steered the union on to a more secure financial footing, attracting new sponsorship and promoting all aspects of the game in the county.OTHER NEWS:Backed by a streamlined executive committee, Mr Pricersquos influence has seen coaching notably improved at all age groups.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast week I joined my fellow Labour MP Ruth Jones, along with Vale of Glamorgan Member of the Senedd Jane Hutt and others, to speak at the s Women of Wales rally in Cardf Bay.The group continues to campaign for justice on their pensions, calling for fair and fast compensation from the UK Government, following the summer finding by the Parliamentary  Health Service Ombudsman that the Department for Work and Pensions should have given more notice of their decision to raise the womenrsquos state pension age.I met group members outside the Senedd, many of whom have faced great hardship as a result of the DWPrsquos actions, and I will continue to support them in their fight for justice.Irsquove recently heard from many constituents about sewage pollution. It is shocking that the UK is ranked th out of  European countries for coastal water quality and only % of waterways meet good ecological status.As a regular open water swimmer myself and someone who loves our beautul rivers, lakes and coastlines, Irsquom deeply alarmed at the ongoing revelations about sewage discharge and other pollution incidents.After UK Conservative MPs tried to block efforts to improve the situation via an amendment to the Environment Bill, the House of Lords emphatically voted to send back the amendment to end the routine discharge of raw sewage into rivers. Unsurprisingly the Government then voted to weaken that amendment.They are simply in the wrong place environmentally and politically ndash which is deeply concerning in the week of COP. We need bolder, more urgent actionwe are to address the climate and nature crisis.While the regulation of water and sewers is generally reserved to the UK Government, here in Wales there are powers to regulate undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales ndash and Irsquom pleased the Welsh Government is committed to tackling pollution by using these powers.This year marks  years of Remembrance as we know it, as the Royal British Legionmarks its centenary..removeAs we approach Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, it was an honour to plant a stake in the first Parliamentary Constituency Garden of Remembrance, to remember all those from Cardf South and Penarth who have served and paid the ultimate sacrice.It brought to mind the huge sacrices of our armed forces across the years and to this day. We owe them all a huge debt of gratitude. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The rough clftop path between bushes resembled a river after previous heavy rainfall and paddling their way along it, a deviation into fields for a quick stop for morning refreshments as overhead there were traces of blue in between the clouds.Crossing a sticky muddy ploughed field brought them to the dismantled railway line where at last the sun made an appearance and following Fort Road and crossing the busy Lavernock Road, a gate led them into Cosmeston Lakes Country Park beside the Medieval Village.A lush green meadow above the Sully Brook brought them to a stile leading into the Community Orchard, planted by volunteers in  and then through a gate into Cogan Wood, where squirrels were bounding and delicately prancing along the ground seeking food before scurrying up into the trees. Reaching Mile Road they continued towards Old Cogan Hall Farm to enter the churchyard of St Peterrsquos where lunch was taken whilst soaking up the sunshine that felt more like May than November.Refreshed they walked on through what had been the deserted medieval settlement of Old Cogan which relates to the th century when the church was built. It appears buildings were set within gardens on either side of a sunken lane and there was a village pond or a well with a mill and leat set to the south of the village..removeA narrow track brought them into woodland at the rear of Myrtle Close to hop across the Sully Brook into the lovely open green space of St Cyres Park with deep blue skies overhead. Then onto pavements taking them through Penarth town by way of Glyndwr Road, Elfed Avenue and across Redlands Road, through Mountjoy Crescent and more open parkland to the lovely upgraded Golden Gates Park and past the Grade II listed St Josephrsquos Church, which took seven years to build as work was interrupted by the Great War.By lane to reach Dingle Road and across the railway footbridge just as a train was approaching and then across the A Windsor Road into Windsor Lane, across Plassey Street to Plassey Square open space and along Harbour View Road to Queen Street. Here they heard the oldest reference to Penarth goes back to Osbert a Norman Knight that granted land there to St Augustinersquos Abbey in Bristol. The land was then taken by King Henry VII and leased out to local well to do families like the Herbertrsquos, Windsorrsquos and Lewis families.This area to the north of Penarth is known as The Bowery and was a poor area without access to education, doctors or a good standard of living. Many of the Irish navvies that came over to build Penarth Docks lodged in this area which became known as lsquoDagger Townrsquo and fights, prostitution, opium dens and gambling along with no doubt a murder or two was re. The Irish making the journey by boat often arrived starving and disease riddenthe journey had taken longer than expected. Whilst to the south of Penarth, it was a dferent story as the middle and upper class residents were better dressed, had moral values and enjoyed wealth and all the other things their counterparts in the north of the town lacked. A lane between houses built into the hillside at the rear of Paget Road brought them to Steep Street for the short walk back to their start, this time with sunny views across Cardf Bay and beyond.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
