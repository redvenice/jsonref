We invested our hearts and so much energy into it over an amazing eleven years,” the statement added. “We believe that together we created one of the country’s best and most loved markets.”The organisers called on Dublin City “to wake up and realise it is essential to provide blank spaces for markets and experimental cultural use, as this is where so many of the seeds of contemporary culture are sown.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department urges schools to engage with parents of children without masks","story":"Third-class pupils at St Clare’s Primary School in Harold’s Cross, Dublin, wearing face masks in the classroom last week.

It will be reviewed in February.Unions and parents’ groups met Department officials on Friday to discuss a range of scenarios where children may attend school without a mask and were invited to identify questions that needed to be answered, a source told The .“Ideally we would have had that available for schools and parents to read over the weekend, but it just wasn’t possible.

I follow it from north and south Utsire (so that’s how it’s spelled!) off the tip of Norway, then clockwise round the coast of Britain to Fastnet, Shannon, Rockall, Malin, Hebrides.Gales, strong gales, storms and violent storms make me glad I’m not a fisherman. I wait for coastal tidings to conjure more neighbourly islands, cliffs and bays. No one mentions Thallabawn, or even Ireland, but I know where these belong in our windswept archipelago.Archipelago was the inspirational, embracing name of an occasional magazine of literature and art launched by Seamus Heaney at Oxford’s Bodleian Library in 2007. Founded and edited by scholar-poet Andrew McNeillie, it ran for 12 issues to 2019 and drew on a vibrant collaboration of 50 or so writers, poets and artists from both islands. A selection of their work now makes up Archipelago: A Reader, a monster paperback of nearly 600 pages, published by Lilliput Press at €25. With such a remarkable abundance of good writing and poems about coastal places, their people and natural world, it becomes the perfect Christmas bedside book for readers of this column. Its original drive was McNeillie’s personal enchantment with the Aran Islands and the corresponding literary treasure of Tim Robinson’s books and maps. The same creative thrust took Robert Macfarlane to Tory in the company of Norman Ackroyd, England’s incomparable etcher of the sea.His images are paced through the book. Darkly intense and atmospheric, they conjure wild waves off Inishbofin, a whirl of gulls off Inishturk, the ghostly pyramids of the Blaskets and more. Offered full page, they help the book to even greater heights of anthology.Connemara also brings poet Richard Murphy, building a house with stones from tumbled bothies and repairing fishing boats that lay “in skirts of seaweed at the quay”. Echoes of the Cleggan disaster prompt Deirdre Ní Chonghaile to an angry meditation on a whole coast of island drownings.The Irish section of Archipelago, launched with a poem by Derek Mahon, is the modest opening to a very big book. Sections on Scotland, England and Wales enlist familiar top talents in nature writing (Tim Dee, Mark Cocker, Roger Deakin, Kathleen Jamie) and poems by Heaney, Longley, Moya Cannon and more. From the Shetlands to Cornwall, Yorkshire and Wales, they shape the many creative bonds to coastal places and people.For more and more Dubliners, the mountains on the southern skyline offer a weekend escape to hilltops, valleys and rivers in landscapes still notably colourful and even wild. The attraction is obvious and never stronger or more popular than in the darker times of the pandemic. There is a national park and way-marked trails and an anorak pocket for the mobile phone.Go back to the 1930s and the texture of the uplands was very different. As Robert Lloyd Praeger described in The Way That I Went, “You can set foot on the heather six miles from the centre of Dublin and, save for crossing two roads, not leave it till you drop down on Aughrim, thirty miles to the southward . . .”At that time, in the outskirts of south Dublin, most minor roads were still gravelled and the Military Road was tarred only to the Co Wicklow boundary. Upland farms were webbed with grassy boreens.This was the landscape, viewed from Rathgar in 1932 that drew the eye of young JB Malone, newly arrived from England. He set out to explore it . A long walk on the lower slopes left him “crippled for a week” but committed to a thorough discovery of the valleys, rivers, cliffs and summits of the Dublin and Wicklow hills.Malone kept notes as he walked, and these fed a long-running column in the Evening Herald. Over the years, this and four books drew more and more Dubliners to the hills. Malone pioneered development of the Wicklow Way promoted Ireland’s network of way-marked trails and helped in the preparation of the Wicklow National Park.All this, as Michael Fewer suggests in his biography of Malone, puts him “in a pantheon that includes Robert Lloyd Praeger, Tim Robinson and Frank Mitchell, men who devoted their lives and studies to aspects of Ireland’s nature and heritage”.JB Malone: The Life and Times of a Walking Pioneer and an Explorer of the Nearby is published by South Dublin Libraries (available for purchase at €20 in all SDL branches). An architect with excellent outdoors writing of his own, Fewer recaptures Malone’s fascination with “those treeless wastes” south of the city.Lastly, there’s a small hardback by an obviously lovely man. In Stolen Moments (Veritas, €17), retired RTÉ broadcaster John Quinn’s second collection of random topics prompts things worth feeling and sharing. From the lost art of whistling to the loss of dream time in the lives of the young, he offers much insight and delight.

Photograph: Getty ImagesMore than 150 passengers have departed Morocco for Ireland on a repatriation flight organised by the Government.The 156 passengers on the flight from Marrakech to Dublin included Irish citizens as well as citizens of several other EU countries and the UK.The journey was organised after flights to and from Morocco were suspended earlier this week until at least December 13th, amid fears over the spread of the new Omicron Covid-19 variant.The repatriation flight on Saturday was operated on behalf of the Government by Ryanair.Responding to news of the flight’s departure, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney hailed the efforts of the Irish Embassy in Rabat in the operation, tweeting: “Well done and thank you!”Meanwhile, live music and theatre venues have been grappling to respond to the new Covid restrictions announced on Friday which will see indoor events limited to half capacity for a month from Tuesday. Ticketmaster urged customers to “please bear with” it while organisers make arrangements following the Government announcement. It said information will be made available as soon as possible.The 3Olympia Theatre in Dublin said it was working with promoters, artists and ticket agents on the logistics involved with shows here in the short term over the ChristmasNew Year’s period.In a statement the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre said it was “currently working with Disney Theatrical Productions to determine how best to manage bookings for the upcoming schedule of The Lion King”. It urged customers to be patient as it worked through the information.Responding to the Government move, the Gaiety Theatre said it was “ working on a system that is fair to our loyal customers and can efficiently handle a large number of ticketing queries that this difficult situation creates”. The Little Mermaid Christmas panto is currently on stage at the theatre. HospitalisationsThe number of Covid patients in hospital has fallen to 487, the lowest level in almost four weeks, the latest official figures show. The number of Covid patients in hospital fell by 41 between Friday and Saturday. There were 5,622 further cases of Covid-19 reported on Saturday. Tweeting about the latest hospital figures on Saturday, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the “plan is working – 3rd doses, masks, test \u0026amp isolate, physical distancing. Thank you for what you are doing. Please don’t lose heart. Let’s all have a safe Christmas.”Meanwhile, waiting times for a Covid booster vaccine were up an hour at Citywest in Dublin on Saturday morning, the HSE said. Boosters are currently being offered to healthcare workers and those aged 60-69 at various walk-in centres across the State. The total number of booster vaccines administered so far is 913,670. The figures come as the Government on Friday announced its most wide-ranging introduction of new restrictions this year after “stark” warnings from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to take immediate action in the face of the threat from the Omicron variant.From Tuesday until at least January 9th, indoor hospitality will be limited to parties of up to six adults per table, while nightclubs will be closed and indoor events limited to half a venue’s capacity. Advice has been issued that households should not host more than three other households in their home, while the use of the vaccine pass is to be extended to gyms and hotel bars and restaurants. Trinity College immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill said the main reason for the new restrictions was the new Omicron variant, and he thought they were needed as the “next three to four weeks are going to be tough”. Speaking to Brendan O’Connor on RTÉ radio, he said it was “strange” that restrictions were being introduced when things are stabilising, with the lowest hospital numbers since November 6th. Prof O’Neill said he was “hopeful” at news that the Omicron variant may have a piece of the common cold virus in it which could make it more like the common cold.On Saturday People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy said the reason for the restrictions was because the Government made “huge mistakes” in terms of cutting contact tracing for schools and restoring full capacity to public transport and offices and not moving quickly enough with antigen testing. CommunicationsThe latest measures were confirmed after tensions re-emerged between the Coalition and its public health advisers during testy exchanges earlier in the day.Nphet had warned that while it was “impossible to quantify the level of risk” from Omicron, this may become clear only “when it may be too late to take mitigating measures”.Saying he shared the “frustration” of the public, Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced a range of restrictions on hospitality as well as associated financial supports.The issue of official communications on Covid-19 was raised at Cabinet, where Ministers took a formal decision that all communications on Covid were now to be managed by and done through the Government Information Service (GIS), which would apply to civil servants and members of advisory bodies. Several well-placed sources said the intervention was seen as a direct response to disquiet among some senior Coalition figures over Nphet’s media strategy.Minister of State Colm Brophy said on Saturday the Government decision meant GIS would “co-ordinate the message” and there would be “one single message”.However, Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin told Virgin Media News on Saturday that while there was a need for clarity of message there was also a need to ensure the Government did not control the message and the public had full access to public health advice. Business Supports The Irish Hotels Federation (IHF) on Saturday described as “extremely disappointing” the “low level” of supports announced by the Government amid the new restrictions. “They fall far short of what is urgently needed given the scale of the crisis now facing the sector,” the IHF said.The Government reopened applications for the pandemic unemployment payment for people from impacted sectors, and a targeted version of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme for the hospitality sector. Businesses such as restaurants and theatres will be able to access the scheme despite not being fully closed. A commercial rates waiver for the first three months of 2022 will be introduced for the hospitality and entertainment sector. An extra €25 million will be made available to support the live entertainment sector. However, the cuts to the employment wage subsidy scheme (EWSS) – the rates of which were cut this week – were not reversed.“It is devastating that the Government has failed to restore employment supports for hotels, despite the collapse in business levels witnessed throughout the country by our sector. We are calling on the Government to revisit this decision and urgently restore EWSS supports to November levels,” IHF president Elaina Fitzgerald Kane said. She said December trade normally sustained very challenging off-peak months but this has been “wiped out”, with occupancy rates of just 35 per cent for December.

Photograph: Nick BradshawEvery Sunday, Fr Stanislaus Hajkowski has about 300 members from Poland and other eastern European countries in his congregation at St Audeon’s in the heart of the Liberties, in Dublin.So far, thankfully, he has not heard of deaths in the Polish community from Covid-19, though the vaccination rates amongst them is far lower than the national average.“A number of people were infected, but they recovered. I didn’t hear of any deaths. In Ireland, we have a young population. Most would be in the early-20s to 40s age group,” said the co-ordinator of the Polish chaplaincy.Fr Hajkowski says he has “been shouted” at by some of his fellow Poles when he has encouraged them to take the Covid-19 vaccine, or to abide by Church and State restrictions.“There are some emotionally imbalanced people in every community,” he said, though they are a minority: “Some may come to provoke me, but a majority understand.”Vaccination rates in eastern Europe lag far behind the Irish performance. Just 53.9 per cent of Poles are fully vaccinated. Vaccination rates in Croatia are at 47.7 per cent, 63.4 per cent in Lithuania, 46.1 per cent Slovakia, and it goes on.Figures from the Health Service Executive this week show that vaccine uptake rates among those from central and eastern Europe living in Ireland are much, much lower.More than a quarter of those in intensive care beds in September and October were not born in Ireland and 57 per cent of them were not vaccinated at all, or just partially vaccinated, said HSE director general Paul Reid.There is, Fr Hajkowski said, “no rational argument” that will persuade those in his community who are steadfast in their opposition to vaccines, or other mitigating measures.Different rulesHis congregation in St Audeon’s accept the need for restrictions, though they query why there are differences between the rules in Poland and Ireland: “Generally, there is little opposition. The rule is ‘use your reason’.”Some Poles hold strong anti-abortion views and fear that some of the vaccines may have been produced using cell lines from aborted foetuses in research and production.Where they do, he refers them to a Vatican statement from December last year, which stated that, where no alternative is available, it is “morally acceptable” to receive such vaccines.Since last year, it has been clarified that mRNA vaccines, such as those developed by Pfizer and Moderna, are synthetic and do not use foetal cell lines in their production.A replica cell line from a foetus aborted in 1973 was used to develop the AstraZenecaOxford University vaccine. However, the vaccine itself does not contain foetal cells.The Vatican document also pointed out that “from the ethical point of view, the morality of vaccination depends not only on the duty to protect one’s own health, but also on the duty to pursue the common good.”SuspiciousSome eastern Europeans, for good reason, have had reason to be suspicious of government-led vaccination programmes in their home countries during the Communist era, he said.Fr Hajkowski also pointed out that “many eastern Europeans live close to nature and, for centuries, developed traditional medicines to deal with disease.”Therefore, “they have been left to their own devices” by authorities. “It’s not the first time they have had to deal with diseases or viruses, after all,” he said, “different countries, different norms and procedures”.Meanwhile, the shadow left by often highly-targeted disinformation and fake news on social media has loomed large over the eastern European community in Ireland.Like many others in the State, many Polish people are worried about the psychological effect of lockdowns on children, believing that “the lockdowns are more damaging to children than the virus”, he said.The 2016 census found that there were just more than 122,500 Poles in Ireland, the largest non-Irish population group, though Fr Hajkowski believes they now number 150,000, with 70,000 or so living in the greater Dublin area.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics the life and legacy of charles j haughey with professor gary murphy","story":"Depending on who you ask, Charles J.

Photograph: Joao SilvaNew York TimesSouth AfricaSouth Africa’s daily number of confirmed Covid-19 cases almost quadrupled since Tuesday as the Omicron variant spread across the country.The country recorded 16,055 infections in the last 24 hours and a positivity rate accelerated to 24.3 per cent from 16.5 per cent on Tuesday, according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases.A South African study of infections since the start of the pandemic found that the risk of reinfection from the Omicron coronavirus variant is three times higher than for any previous strain.More people under 40 are contracting Covid-19 as a fourth wave sweeps across South Africa, early data from the nation’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases showed.BrazilRio de Janeiro has cancelled its New Year’s Eve party due to renewed Covid-19 fears. The city’s mayor Eduardo Paes announced the decision on social media. Mr Paes had previously promised the biggest New Year’s Eve party ever, with multiple firework displays and artists performing on a dozen stages across the city. He said there is no decision about the annual carnival, due to take place in March. The yearly celebration on Copacabana beach has in the past gathered more than one million locals and tourists. Other Brazilian cities, including Sao Paulo and Salvador, have also cancelled New Year’s Eve celebrations due to fears of the omicron variant. So far, the ministry of health has confirmed five Omicron cases in Brazil.AustraliaCovid vaccines could soon be rolled out for children as young as five in Australia, the country’s government has said, as the chief health officer in New South Wales, Kerry Chant, warned of “an uptick” in Omicron cases in metropolitan Sydney. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Saturday that vaccine regulators were set to decide on giving Pfizer to children by the end of the year.If all goes well, the doses will be rolled out from January, and Mr Hunt said the process was “heading in a positive direction”.Thousands of people again turned out in Melbourne on Saturday in the first mass demonstration since the Victorian government passed its new pandemic laws.The mostly maskless crowds shouted “sack Dan Andrews” (premier of Victoria) and “freedom”, and were seen waving Donald Trump placards, United Australia party (UAP) posters, Eureka and national flags, and signs about various conspiracy theories.The UAP leader, Craig Kelly, who has been criticised for posting misleading information about the pandemic online, addressed the crowd. He called Victoria a “fascist medical state” because, when he refused to show his Covid vaccine certificate, he was unable to hire a rental car at Melbourne airport.Counter-protesters, who said hostility to vaccines had become a “gateway to the far right”, marched in Carlton. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the protests, which have been fuelled by the pandemic laws, which give the premier and the health minister more power over public health orders, should be peaceful and “based on up-to-date facts” – suggesting some were complaining about laws that had already been changed.Thirty-nine Covid cases have been linked to protests in the state last month, mostly in unvaccinated people. Three people have been hospitalised and one is in intensive care.A total of 13 Omicron cases have been found in New South Wales, one in Australian Capital Territory, and one in the Northern Territory. South Australia recorded five further Covid cases on Saturday, leading the state’s chief public health officer to recommend that borders be shut. But instead it was agreed to require all arrivals from New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory to be tested upon arrival.In Australia, 87.9 per cent of people aged 16 and over are double vaccinated. The highest rate is in Canberra, where 97.9 per cent of those aged 12 and over are now fully vaccinated. UKGovernment officials and scientific advisers in the UK believe that the danger posed by the Omicron variant may not be clear until January, potentially allowing weeks of intense mixing while the variant spreads.Minutes for the British Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggest there is deep concern about the threat from the new variant, particularly its transmissibility. Though there is a wariness about over-reacting, one government scientific adviser said Downing Street was “putting all its eggs in one basket” by focusing its efforts on the booster vaccine drive.“It should be a balance between social mixing and immunity. That will affect how quickly it spreads,” the adviser said. “At the moment we are not really doing anything to reduce mixing. It’s disruptive and it’s damaging to the economy, but at the very least we could encourage people to think about their contacts.”Some senior Sage scientists have made the case privately that the additional precaution of home working should be taken in the run-up to Christmas and that the government should start to suggest that people take sensible steps to minimise social contact in the days before seeing loved ones.“We may wait till next year to see an exponential increase and then introduce plan B. And then that doesn’t work and we end up having to do more intense things. It’s undoubtedly a very difficult judgment,” one Sage adviser said.Ministers have acknowledged that the current figures for Omicron in the UK may be more than two weeks old and vastly underestimate the true picture.A further 75 cases of Omicron have been identified in England, bringing the total there to 104, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Twenty-nine cases have been detected in Scotland and one in Wales. No cases of Omicron have been identified in Northern Ireland. IndiaIndia reported its third case of the Omicron variant on Saturday, government officials said, as total Covid-19 cases inched closer to the 35 million mark.Officials in the western state of Gujarat said the patient who tested positive for Omicron was a 72-year old man of Indian origin who had lived in Zimbabwe for decades, and returned on November 28th.India reported 8,603 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, taking the total to 34.62 million. Deaths rose by 415 to 470,530.Prime minister Narendra Modi last month asked officials to focus on countries identified at risk, after the World Health Organisation declared the new variant to be “of concern”.India expects the Omicron variant to cause less severe illness, due to rising vaccination rates and high prior exposure to the Delta variant that infected nearly 70 per cent of the population by July.The federal health ministry said on Thursday that India had identified two male patients, aged 66 and 46, who had the new strain in the southern state of Karnataka. The first person was a South African national while the second one, an Indian physician, had no recent travel history.India has fully vaccinated just half of its 944 million adults despite having ample supplies of domestically made shots.

It is frankly very cowardly, and I would expect better of the students here. I feel it necessary to add that we know the identity of at least one of the students who is leaking these screenshots, and that they will be removed for breaking the confidentiality of the group.Mr Dunleavy also doubled down on the compulsory race workshops. WCSA is proud of the initiatives it has put forward over the past academic year, including its anti-racism workshops, and we fully intend to build upon these in the coming year,” he said.“We are proud to support our entire community and address and action issues that affect us all.Sources inside the college said the union initially banned an innocent student and some students had started a rebel group in protest. One said: “They post lots of welfare issues on the Facebook group that never reach the student mailing list, such as recent drink spiking events at the university. How can they create two tiers of students and deny people this information?”Toby Young, general secretary of the Free Speech Union, said: “The college authorities should be embarrassed. They’ve relinquished their leadership role and the result is that a student mob is now in charge.He added: Why would anyone want to go to Wolfson if the college is now run by a group of Maoist thugs in short trousers?”In the mandatory race workshops, students were told microaggressions were brief, everyday interactions that left people feeling devalued, such as saying “you speak good English”. Another PowerPoint slide claimed: “Google search images are white people unless you specify otherwise.”Another row in October saw students write a formal letter of complaint accusing a matriculation photographer of sexism for asking “gentlemen to help the ladies” at the end of the onboarding ceremony. They claimed this created a “targeted atmosphere of inequality” and punctured a “safe space for all genders” on campus.Wolfson College and its student association did not respond to requests for comment.More from NewsPrince William says ‘nothing better’ than listening to ACDC’s heavy rock musicRural retirees ‘can end up in unsuitable, unsafe homes’Valuable drawings by Dame Laura Knight stolen after Royal Mail left them on doorstepHospitals urged to boost counter-terror security after Liverpool blastCovid pill to be rolled out before ChristmasShakespeare actors should be taught sexual ethics, says academicMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"climate change committee has vastly overplayed hand","story":"The UK Climate Change Committee (CCC) this week published a report on the outcome of COP26, predictably calling for government to “walk the talk” and implement policies that will deliver net zero by 2050. True to form, the CCC is acting like an eco-activist NGO rather than offering balanced and independent advice. And, as usual, its recommendations are being treated as beyond questioning.To grasp the scale of influence this independent advisory body now holds, look no further than Parliament’s decision in 2019 to wave through the net zero target without even a Commons vote. In a move that one expert described as a “failure of politics,” our elected representatives bypassed the opportunity to scrutinise the policy and associated secondary legislation, because they relied on the CCC’s improbable assessment that net zero was “necessary, feasible, cost effective” and “achievable with known technologies”.The economic analysis in the Committee’s 2019 Net Zero Report has been subsequently criticised for a lack of rigour and transparency. Detailed economic analysis on net zero pathways was absent, but the CCC nonetheless concluded the cost of achieving it by 2050 would be 1-2 per cent of GDP. The underlying calculations weren’t published until long after the legally binding target had been legislated. But deference towards bodies like the Climate Change Committee allows government departments to introduce potentially costly or disruptive policies without taking full responsibility for their decisions – or full accountability if things go wrong.This autumn it became starkly apparent that, with current technology, our small island can either be net zero or have secure and affordable energy. It cannot, at present, have both. In guiding us towards very specific targets rather than planning for a range of outcomes over a lengthy period, the CCC is helping shut down the market discovery process, meaning we may never uncover the most cost-effective solutions to decarbonisation.In the 13 years since the CCC was established, its scope has expanded enormously to include ever-increasing areas of the economy and our way of life. This latest briefing, for instance, makes pronouncements on foreign aid, insisting we should “restore the commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP”. The report also takes a view on our diets, seeking to cut meat and dairy consumption by reducing demand not just to reduce emissions or pressure on land for deforestation, but also to benefit “public health”. It was F A Hayek who wrote that “the greatest danger to liberty today comes from the efficient expert administrators exclusively concerned with what they regard as the public good”.The Committee’s solutions are statist, interventionist and lacking thorough cost-benefit analysis. And though it was set up to provide quality advice including on the economic and social implications of climate policies, it is monomaniacal about decarbonisation.What’s more, almost all of its resources are devoted towards mitigation rather than adaptation – a gamble when our contribution to global emissions is so small that meaningful success in the former relies on the kind of international action COP26 hoped, and failed, to guarantee.The idea that, if we are to halt climate change then we need to start doing things differently, has become mainstream in a way that eco-warriors from the 1990s only dreamt of. That the climate change challenge is being taken seriously by politicians is a positive development. But if the body advising the Government on climate change does not learn how to make balanced decisions pegged to rigorous cost-benefit analysis, then we will soon find ourselves in deeply troubled waters. Annabel Denham is Director of Communications at the IEAMore from NewsPrince William says ‘nothing better’ than listening to ACDC’s heavy rock musicRural retirees ‘can end up in unsuitable, unsafe homes’Valuable drawings by Dame Laura Knight stolen after Royal Mail left them on doorstepHospitals urged to boost counter-terror security after Liverpool blastCovid pill to be rolled out before ChristmasShakespeare actors should be taught sexual ethics, says academicMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust accused passive vandalism turning lake bog","story":"For 250 years, the residents of a small Cotswolds village enjoyed views over a carefully designed serpentine lake as they watched birds including heron, kingfishers and osprey visiting its waters.That was, until the National Trust was bequeathed the country estate upon which it sits and engaged in what residents describe as acts of “passive vandalism”.The Sherborne Brook – known locally as the Broadwaters – is now full of silt and weeds run rampant, transforming the lake into “a bog”. The boat house and turbine house, once used to power the village, sit derelict.The relations between the charity and residents have now reached an “all-time low”. In a village with a population of just over 300, the campaign group calling for the Trust to act has around 140 members.Many more who live in Sherborne, Gloucestershire, rent their homes or farms from the Trust and are said to be “too afraid” to publicly criticise their landlords.“Tempers are beginning to fray,” said Victor Edelstein who is among those who have offered their time to help the Trust as part of a plea for them to act.“It has been destroyed,” he said. “Ironically, Sherborne comes from the Old English words meaning bright water.“Part of the magic of the Broadwater was that we had masses of different waterfowl coming here, it was like watching a ballet.But that is all gone because there is no water. There used to be a sign by the gate describing which birds you could see, but it was quietly taken away.”Mr Edelstein has an eye for the beautiful. A former couturier best known for the dresses he designed for Diana, Princess of Wales, he is now a renowned artist.When he moved to the village, he thought that he could depend on the National Trust to preserve the Grade II listed landscape which had attracted him.But since then he has had to watch on as inaction – what he describes as “passive vandalism” – means that the lake has slowly filled with silt and been taken over by weeds. The once 10ft deep water is now only a fraction of that.It is feared that soon the situation will become irreversible.Villagers believe that many of the issues would have been simple to fix if they had been addressed immediately but, left to fester, they deteriorated and ended up costing thousands.The community has tried to maintain the Broadwaters. A group went to dig out the drainage and some used to take out a boat to clear the weeds, before the silt got too deep for them to get on the water.Residents even commissioned a professional report on how to get the turbine up and running to provide power to the school, local shop and the Trust’s office. But all of their offers have fallen on deaf ears, they say.After years of dispute, the Trust says it is regularly engaging with residents and they recently held meetings. But they were accused of being “condescending” after refusing the pleas to clear the waters.“Every country in the world has drained swamps,” Mr Edelstein’s wife, artist Annamaria Succi, told the charity’s conservation representative during the meeting. “But the Trust has managed to create one.”Roger Davies, who founded the Sherborne Brook Support Group, said that relations “can only be described as pretty poor” and the “community would like the heritage significance of this landscape to be strengthened rather than discounted as unimportant”.The Trust argued on Friday night that they “work hard” alongside volunteers and partners “to ensure it remains a special place for future generations”, adding: “There is no question of abandonment.”The spokesman added that they “recognise there are strong views but we need to be mindful of the fact that we are managing a long-term plan for a sensitive area for history, nature and people.”The charity was bequeathed the 4,500 acre Sherborne Park on which the Broadwaters sit in 1987, as well as around 80 homes in the village, after the death of Charles Dutton, 7th Baron Sherborne. Sherborne House had already been sold and split into flats.Locals believe that part of the reason for the alleged neglect is because without a country house it is not one of the charity’s “flagship properties”.A 2013 document produced by the Trust said that the views that take in Sherborne Brook “an 18th century formal landscape of lakes and cascades – should be considered especially significant”.But in a letter to residents in October they said that the “unsuitable nature of dredging – financially, ecologically and because of the contribution of carbon emissions to climate change” means that they have decided against it.But, locals point out, for 250 years before the Trust took over this was a lake. “They used to clear out the silt and it didn’t do any harm to the ecology,” Mr Edelstein said.On Friday night, a spokesman for the charity said that their work was “being informed by detailed research and careful planning – and regular discussions with local communities and partner bodies” including the Environment Agency and Historic England.She said that they have shared plans for work with the community, including for repairs to the boat and turbine house, adding: “We will continue to work to ensure the water keeps moving through this rural stretch of parkland, while striking the right balance for the natural environment and historic landscape.”Though the Trust says there are no specific plans, there are rumours locally that they are considering expanding the car parks and opening cafeterias.“How in good conscience could you encourage more people to come here to visit a bog?” Mr Edelstein wondered.More from NewsPrince William says ‘nothing better’ than listening to ACDC’s heavy rock musicRural retirees ‘can end up in unsuitable, unsafe homes’Valuable drawings by Dame Laura Knight stolen after Royal Mail left them on doorstepHospitals urged to boost counter-terror security after Liverpool blastCovid pill to be rolled out before ChristmasShakespeare actors should be taught sexual ethics, says academicMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"woke activists take note no public appetite erasing british","story":"The good people of Sheffield have decided they would rather keep the names of streets that commemorate iniduals associated by activists with the slave trade and other imperial ventures. Some people are supposedly tainted by family association, including Gladstone, who also supported compensation for slave owners after abolition – but would abolition have been politically possible without this enormously costly concession? Even George Canning, who opposed abolition, is acceptable to the citizens of Sheffield. Cancel culture is imposed wherever activists have the chance but the public simply does not want it.The sheer pointlessness of excising names should be, but never is, obvious to activists. If people’s names are forgotten, what will happen to the memory of the acts of which they are accused? Actually, it is physically impossible to excise their names. Take the case of libraries. In Oxford, the Fellows of All Souls, who include some of the cleverest people in the land, seem to have forgotten that each and every book acquired before Codrington’s name was removed from the great library he endowed carries his name on the book plate. Meanwhile Codrington College in Barbados, which he founded in the hope of benefiting the Afro-Caribbean population, has no intention of renaming itself.Another library under pressure to change its name is the Seeley Historical Library in Cambridge, easily the best undergraduate history library in the country. Whereas Codrington’s library is housed in one of the most magnificent buildings in Oxford, the Seeley is nowadays housed in a hideous structure designed by James Stirling in the 1960s. It was established by the nineteenth-century Regius Professor of History Sir John Seeley. He has long been forgotten, apart from his remark that the British Empire was acquired ‘in a fit of absence of mind’, and one might have thought that his opponents would simply accept that he has faded into obscurity. No students ever noticed that his motto, emblazoned on the glass doors of the library, is IMPERIUM ET LIBERTAS, ‘Empire and Freedom’, but of course even elementary Latin has not been required for admission to Cambridge for over half a century. Is every volume to have all its book stamps solemnly blotted out with cleansing fluid?What happens when the activists scale everything upwards from Codrington and Seeley to bigger institutions? There is no known evidence that its name deters people from applying to Imperial College. The story used to circulate that at the time of the proposed (and failed) merger with University College London the negotiators from Imperial proudly argued that the new institution should adopt one name from each college – Imperial from Imperial and College from UCL.All this is a great opportunity for branding companies. When I put those two words into Google I was informed that there were 1,870,000,000 relevant sites. Admittedly, the industry is a little smaller than that but the passion for rebranding is based on a false premise, as I realised this week walking through the streets of Cambridge. The present fashion among students is for padded jackets emblazoned not with a ghastly college logo (my own college uses a silhouette of its well-known Gate of Honour) but a good old-fashioned coat of arms.In any case, none of this is much consolation to the residents of my own street, Trafalgar Street, if Nelson and his achievements are deemed unacceptable. No one is going to pay me for the time and effort in notifying every website, office or institution across the world where my address is recorded and the dragon in Cambridge Post Office who recently, in defiance of Royal Mail rules, refused to hand over a parcel addressed to my wife because I showed her a utility bill in my name, but not hers, will have even more cause to hold on to mail addressed to a street that no longer exists. And this problem will then be replicated thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of times, in homes, shops and offices across the country.Since the public is opposed to changing street names, new politically correct names will have to be imposed from above. How long will they be deemed acceptable? The Russian case is instructive: Stalingrad has already disappeared from the world map, and Peter the Great has won back Leningrad. The best way to deal with people and events whose reputation is now being questioned is actually to preserve their name so that their admirers can admire and their detractors can luxuriate in the sinister pleasure they find in detraction.More from NewsPrince William says ‘nothing better’ than listening to ACDC’s heavy rock musicRural retirees ‘can end up in unsuitable, unsafe homes’Valuable drawings by Dame Laura Knight stolen after Royal Mail left them on doorstepHospitals urged to boost counter-terror security after Liverpool blastCovid pill to be rolled out before ChristmasShakespeare actors should be taught sexual ethics, says academicMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"asthma inhalers set added work","story":"Exclusive: Asthma inhalers set to be added to work first aid kits after death of -year-old chefLauren Reid died in February last year after a serious asthma attack in her Gin Glasgow restaurant.

Lauren Reid died in February last year after a serious asthma attack in her Gin Glasgow restaurant. She had forgotten to bring her inhaler to work and suffered brain damage after a cardiac arrest. Days later Mum Elaine Cunningham, , made the heartbreaking decision to switch off her le support. Elaine has been campaigning ever since for a Lauren’s Law which would legally require salbutamol inhalers now only available on prescription to be kept in commercial kitchens. She said: “If an inhaler had been in the first aid kit she would be alive today. “I do my grieving indoors and this campaign has kept me going. Now it looks like there’s going to be a law in my daughter’s name and that’s humbling.”  Care minister Gillian Keegan told MPs there were a number of regulatory hoops to jump through first. She added: “We would need to ensure that the benefits of such a change would outweigh any risks.” Yet an amendment to the law in  means that schools already have emergency inhalers on hand for asthmatic students. But to make them available in workplaces needs evidence to satisfy the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the independent Commission on Human Medicines. And then there would have to be a public consultation before any change in the law could be made. Brian Mcelderry of chef’s union Unichef predicted that the necessary safeguards could be in place by next year. He said: “We are heartened by the way this is going. We are aware we must ticks some boxes but we’re knocking them off one by one.”  And shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting added: “I hope the Government look at this quickly. It’s a common sense thing to do. “If we can save other lives in the future it will provide comfort to Lauren’s family and be a wonderful campaigning legacy.” One in  people now suffer from asthma, and for , who have the disease seriously it can be le threatening. Restaurant kitchens are particularly risky because powder, flour, fumes, heat and humidity can all trigger attacks. But grain and poultry dusts are a danger to asthmatic farm workers as is bleach to hairdressers, wood dust in timber mills and chlorine in indoor swimming pools. Asthma UK boss Joseph Carter said: “Asthma is not taken seriously enough and every day in the UK three families like Lauren’s go through the agony of losing a loved one. “It is essential that everyone with asthma has access to the medication they need in an emergency.” Tory MP Nick Fletcher added: “Salbutamol inhalers have been licensed for more than two decades. “Side effects are typically mild and do not last long.” Independent MP Margaret Ferrier added: “Making sure salbutamol inhalers are available in high-risk environments is an easy thing to do.” The UK has the worst death rate from asthma in Europe in those aged between  to .

They have been asked to record unmarked public footpaths going back centuries before a Government deadline expires on New Year’s Day, . And that is the equivalent of walking nearly twice round the world That would mean from Monday the walkers charity will need to identy  miles of rights of way a day for the next four yearsthe public is to continue to have access to them. Realising the impossibility of the task, the Government is now considering extending the expiry date for the work to be completed. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said: “Deferring the  cut-off date for registration of historic rights of way is a possibility. “However, we must weigh this against the desire for certainty around where rights of way exist which the cut-off date will bring.” The task set for ramblers was to find public footpaths in use before  missed when the last official maps were drawn up  years ago.  Ramblers programme manager Jack Cornish said: “We have a huge job ahead. “We are now racing against time to identy the most important and useful of these paths, collect the necessary historic evidence and submit applications before the cut-off.” Tory MP Siobhan Baillie said: “We need a revised date. Legally recording all rights of way does not look possible by . We must get it right.” The South West has most missing walkways with , miles and the North East the least with , miles. Those which are not registered with local authorities by  would no longer be considered as rights of way.

Some are overgrown and unusable while others are being walked constantly without being officially recorded. And it is now a battle with the clock to provide the evidence local authorities need for inclusion in future maps.Ms Pow said much of the Whitehall work on the project had been hampered by Brexit preparations and other legislation taking priority over new rights of way laws.Mr Cornish said: “We understand that Brexit and the pandemic caused delays. “But we are now calling on the government to extend the deadline to ensure we can protect these routes for generations to come.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyNew YearPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Newly published documents reveal Stephen McPartland started working for MBU Capital last month, providing “strategic advice” infor £, a month. The Stevenage MP already works ten hours a month as a non-executive director of Furniture Village, from which he pockets more than £, a month - despite telling voters before his election that he would make being an MP his “full-time job”. MBU Capital Group is a London-based financial firm which invests in national resources, education, cannabis CBD and real estate. He took the new job on  November, and according to the register expects to work for eight hours a month - which amounts to £ an hour. But the Mirror can reveal the Stevenage MP’s relationship with the firm goes back several years. Archive pictures show he posed with the firmaposs managing partner, Ajaz Ahmed, after MBU secured permission to build a block of flats in the centre of Stevenage in . And a few months earlier, the firm had donated £, to Mr McPartlandaposs local Conservative Party.Labour Party Chair Anneliese Dodds said: “The people of Stevenage will wonder why their Conservative MP has been raking in thousands from a property developer when he’s supposed to be working for them.“He should also explain why he has been so opposed to plans to build affordable housing in the town, but so in favour of a multi-million pound property development there.” Mr McPartland has previously opposed council plans to build housing in and around the town, writing letters of objection and asking ministers to call in planning applications. But he welcomed the private development of Park Place by his donor and future employer, saying: Park Place marks another important step forward in the regeneration of Stevenage town centre. “The £m development demonstrates the confidence that investors have in the future of the town.” There’s no suggestion of wrongdoing by Mr McPartland or MBU Capital.Ms Dodds added: “This seems like yet another example of how Boris Johnson and his MPs act asthere is one rule for them, and another rule for everyone .”Boris Johnson has promised an overhaul of the rules governing MPs outside earnings - banning MPs from “exploiting their positions” by working as paid consultants. But Labour have argued his plans don’t go far enough, and pledged to ban all second jobs for MPs, with just a handful of exemptions.

He added: “The biggest priority is to recruit, train and retain staff for the long term. “NHS workers who came to see me were in tears because they were on poverty pay and we will lose themwe don’t pay them properly. “But it’s not simply about money. You need investment but also reform to deliver results for patients.” His first act is to write to Sajid Javid demanding the Health Secretary comes clean over a promise of  new hospitals. He said: “Boris Johnson counts paint jobs as a new hospital. We need to know more about this phantom programme. People are treated in dilapidated hospitals no longer fit for purpose.” He wants aof in-person GP consultations, saying: “Technology frees up time. But face-to-face appointments should be there for those who want it.”  The Ilford North MP slammed Tory hikes in National Insurance and council tax and social care reforms which burden those less well-off.Mr Streeting said: “The air of mild shambles around the PM reflects the way he runs his Government and that has serious consequences.” He said mandatory masks in enclosed spaces should never have been abandoned, adding: “They’re a pain in the backside. But they are a minor inconvenience compared to the consequences for lives and livelihoods.” His promotion at  has prompted talk that he could be a Labour leader.“No leadership ambitions,” he said emphatically. “The only ambition I’ve got is to get Keir Starmer into No.” And he has no plans to avoid Christmas parties, adding: “People must make their own common sense judgements.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSConservative PartyLabour PartyWes StreetingBoris JohnsonHospitalsCouncil taxPoliticsChristmas partyHip replacements\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, this week I was green with envy as Barbadians held a massive shindig to celebrate becoming a republic. Rihanna dazzled as Prince Charles sweated and waffled about the “atrocity of slavery” while the British state he will soon be the head of refuses to pay reparations to the descendants of those slaves. Not that he’d have a say in it. In fact, despite the weird letters he sends to ministers pushing his wacky causes and protecting the £million he earns annually from the Duchy of Cornwall, he won’t have a real say in anything when he’s king. He’ll be as pointless as the valet he pays to put toothpaste on his brush. I won’t join the royalist orgy next year when the Queen’s reign hits  but I’ll admit the plaudits she’ll receive for dedicating herself to the service of her country will be well deserved. The problem for us Republicans is that she has infantilised a nation whose older citizens cling to the black-and-white Britain she links us to, like Jacob Rees-Mogg to his nanny’s apron. But she will be gone soon and when she is, would it be too much to ask for an honest debate about whether the monarchy should go too   Would it be such a bad thing for us to work outwe’d like to follow the path of other grown-up democracies, like Barbados, and elect our head of state rather than have the next royal accident of birth imposed by this one family  Imagine what we could do with all those palaces, not to mention the £ million a year it costs to let them live like dukes and princesses. What a farce those titles are.The Sussexes of Montecito, Calornia, have as much claim on Sussex as my Romanian rescue dog. Same with the Cambridges and the Kents. As for the Yorks, what has that fine city done to deserve the gruesome twosome Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson taking its name  What priceless gall the royal spinners have, painting Meghan Markle as the spawn of the devil, then whistling into the wind when the grand old Duke of York’s name comes up.I think we’d be doing the Royals a favour because judging by the recent two-part BBC documentary on the princes, they look as miserable as sin, while most of them resent us for prolonging their goldfish bowl existence. The current House of Windsor appears to be a backbiting bitchfest where everyone spins and lies to curry favour. And for what  They hate the press, the BBC, makers of The Crown and each other almost as much as doing a proper job. So when the Good Ship Lizzie sails into the sunset, why not let all the Royals, like the Montecito miserabilistsFind Freedom. Permanently. We have nothing to lose but our tugged forelocks.

That has prompted fears he could extend or increase restrictions a few days before Christmas. But at a meeting on Monday, the government’s Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciessaid it was possible the situation won’t even wait that long. They agreed: “Evenmeasures are introduced immediately, there may not be time to fully ascertain whether they are sufficient before decisions are needed on further action.” They went on: “The situation could develop quickly over the coming weeks. “Decision-makers may need to act while there is still a high level of uncertainty, including considering the potential need for stringent response measures.” The dramatic recommendation is contained within a SAGE paper published on Friday, that was leaked to the BBC on Wednesday. The BBC published several other portions of its contents two days ago, including a warning that the iant could need “very stringent response measures”it threatens the NHS.The notes say it is “highly likely” that the multiple-mutated strain can resist vaccine immunity “to some extent”, like the Delta iant does. “It is highly likely that Omicron can escape immunity to some extent, but it is not yet clear how much,” they say. The notes add: Any signicant reduction in protection against infection could still result in a very large wave of infections. “This would in turn lead to a potentially high number of hospitalisations even with protection against severe disease being less affected. It comes after Boris Johnson insisted a Christmas lockdown was extremely unlikely. The notes add: “It is important to be prepared for a potentially very signicant wave of infections with associated hospitalisations now, ahead of data being available.“The size of this wave remains highly uncertain but may be of a scale that requires very stringent response measures to avoid unsustainable pressure on the NHS.“If vaccine efficacy is substantially reduced, then a wave of severe disease should be expected.”  The SAGE advisors went further than Boris Johnson in their recommendations for measures to fight the iant. They said a single Day  PCR test for UK arrivals - which the PM has introduced - will “identy signicantly fewer cases” than two PCR tests, as recommended by the Scottish and Welsh governments.They also sad pre-departure tests for inbound travellers - which the government has not introduced despite Labour ’s urging - “are valuable in identying potentially infectious people before they board”.SAGE also warned lateral flow tests will be “ particularly important over the upcoming holiday period” for people attending parties, even suggesting they could be taken daily. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said people should “maybe” take a lateral flow test before going to parties. The experts said: “ Colder weather is likely to affect natural ventilation levels, as windows are less likely to be opened. There are some very preliminary indications that Omicron might show more airborne transmission .”When the SAGE paper first emerged on Wednesday, a government spokesman said: “As soon as we became aware of the Omicron iant we took rapid action to protect public health - including expanding the red list, introducing PCR testing for travellers, changing the rules on self-isolation for close contacts and mandating face coverings in shops and on public transport. “On top of this we are speeding up our vaccination programme by offering all adults in England a booster jab by the end of January, halving the gap between second doses and boosters, and offering second jabs to - year olds, following advice from the JCVI.

But last month, bosses at bus operator Go North West Ltd gave Tracey her notice - ruling that she was no longer tall enough to safely drive their vehicles, according to Unite the Union. The trade union said Tracey was offered an alternative role in the company, but one with fewer hours and less pay - which would leave her in financial hardship.Tracey was handed her -week notice after refusing the new position. She is now appealing the decision, Manchester Evening News reports. In the days since her battle was made public, Bolton-born actress Maxine Peake, Coronation Street star Julie Hesmondhalgh, and actor James Quinn, have all got in touch to offer words of support, Tracey said.I could have never expected anything like this, she said. Iaposm overwhelmed and so emotional with it at the minute. People are getting in touch with me who I donapost even know. Itaposs been absolutely lovely to get that response, itaposs like one big family. As part of the fight for Tracey to keep her job, her colleagues have started a petition which now has more than , signatures.

Tracey Scholes, who is five feet, says she was one of few women in the job when she started driving buses in Greater Manchester.On her first day in , she recalls a very frosty reception and says there weren’t even female toilets on the Cheetham Hill site, reported the Manchester Evening News.But trailblazer Tracey remained at the depot with First bus and then Go North West, when they took over in , and it was a devastating blow when she was given her notice last month. The reason, claims Unite union, is that since the operator has repositioned its wing mirrors, Tracey is too short to use them at the same time as reaching the pedals. Unite claims Tracey was told she no longer had the capability to safely drive the buses and she was offered an alternative role at the company, but for less hours and pay. Tracey declined and was given  weeksapos notice, a decision she is now appealing. Tracey, , from Heywood, said: “This is heartbreaking. I’m a widow with three children, a house and a mortgage and it’s nearly Christmas. “I’ve never had to involve the union before, I’ve never had a disciplinary, never been suspended. “I’ve always gone to management myself with any issues and worked it through.” Tracey said the firm began replacing broken branch mirrors to the side of the windscreen with side mirrors, around two years ago. When Tracey tried to drive these buses, she’d have to lean around a pillar on the cab assault screen to see the mirror, meaning her feet lted off the pedals. Tracey brought this to management’s attention and bosses assigned her routes driving single and double deckers with the old-style mirrors, she claims. Tracey was most recently assigned the  route from Shudehill to Prestwich, and says she would increasingly arrive on sht to find the tricky wing mirrors. “It’s one of the most important pieces of equipment on the bus. You need it to turn a corner or pull into a bus stop. When you turn you need to watch that mirror to see the angles on the back wheel so you don’t clip a curb,” said Tracey. “For years I could drive everything in the garage. But I was running out of buses I could drive.” She added: I’m flabbergasted that they can just get rid of me after  years. I love my job, I don’t want to lose it. I have regular customers and a regular route.  Tracey has been moved by the outpouring of support from her colleagues. I work with such a great bunch of lads. They are lovely, she said. “I’ve had such tremendous support with this. It’s just blown me away.” As part of the fight for Tracey to keep her job, her colleagues have started a petition which now has more than , signatures. A Unite the union spokesman said: “Tracey is a hardworking, loved and a valued member of the NW   Branch and the Queens Road family who deserves to be commended for her years of service to the traveling public of Greater Manchester. “However Go North West Ltd has dismissed her from employment because they changed the manufacturer specication on their fleet of buses resulting in five foot tall Tracey being physically unable to operate company vehicles safely. “Go North West Ltd have refused to consider proposals from Tracey and her Unite trade union reps to keep her in employment. “This has resulted in her unfair dismissal from Go North West Ltd for capability to fulfil her role a PCV driver. “The company’s only resolution is to offer Tracey a position in the company that would see Tracey’s pay and hours cut signicantly leaving her in financial hardship.

Aled Davies tested positive for coronavirus last August despite being double jabbed.But as he spent most of his le in relatively good health with only a broken arm and the removal of a cyst blotting his NHS notes, he didnapost foresee what was to come.Within days of displaying the telltale symptoms of a fever and persistent cough, the -year-old went rapidly downhill and needed an urgent admission to hospital. His breathing deteriorated to such an extent that his lungs completely failed and left him just a couple of hours from death.My body had deteriorated so much that they phoned my parents to say that I probably wouldnapost come out of this alive. My lungs just couldnapost take the infection, he told Wales Online.  Support worker Aled, who tested positive for Covid on August , said he was about to come out of his -day isolation when he woke up on September  unable to breathe.I didnapost lose my taste or smell, but I did have every other symptom including body aches, headaches, and I couldnapost sleep, said Aled, whose entire family became unwell with the virus.The first day [I tested positive] I was alright, but then things got worse and worse until I couldnapost breathe, I couldnapost talk and my lips turned blue. Soon after dialling , paramedics from the Welsh Ambulance Service arrived at his home in Tredegar and rushed him to The Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran where he was immediately given breathing support. But after a couple of days in isolation on a Covid ward he needed to be taken to intensive care, placed on a ventilator and put in an induced coma. Obviously I was nervous about it. I knew how serious it was to be put on a ventilator but the doctors knew what was best for me, he said. After three days on a ventilator, hospital staff could see no improvement in Aledaposs lungso the decision was made to transfer him by ambulance to Guyaposs and St Thomasapos Hospital in London where he would be put on an ECMO machine.  The machine acted as an articial lung for Aled while his own lungs were drained of infection and given a much-needed rest. They had to drain all the blood out of my body on the one side and push it back through the other side with fresh oxygenated blood because I wasnapost producing oxygen, he explained. You have to meet a certain criteria to even go on an ECMO machine, so I was very lucky. Itaposs used as a last resort when all other options have failed. Thankfully Aled responded well on the machine and came off it four days later. He was then taken by air ambulance back to The Grange University Hospital for further treatment. I woke up [from the coma] on September  and I didnapost have a clue what had happened. If theyaposd told me Iaposd just been ventilated at The Grange and stayed there I would have believed them. I had stitches everywhere and a million tubes in me, he recalled. Aled, who spent his th birthday in hospital, admitted that he thought his parents would be far more unwell than him as they both have autoimmune disorders.  There is no explanation as to why I had it so bad. Iaposve always been prone to coughs and chest infections but Iaposve never been diagnosed with any underlying conditions. My lungs took a hiding - they just couldnapost handle it. After a brief stint in Nevill Hall Hospital after his transfer from The Grange, Aled was discharged on September  - but he still had to learn to walk again and build up his strength. I lost three-and-a-bit stone in  days. I lost all the muscles in my legs and arms - they shrunk to nothing. I also had to walk with a stick. It took me half an hour to get up a flight of stairs when I got out, he said. I bought a personal trainer plan so Iaposve just been looking at that. Driving again was also a big relief. Some days Iaposm absolutely fine and getting my steps in, but other times Iaposm so tired I just need to stay in bed.Aled heaped praise on NHS staff throughout his coronavirus treatment and admitted he wouldnapost have survived without them.Thereaposs a lot of frustration with the NHS, but the staff were incredible. I didnapost come across a single person who wasnapost helpful. Everyone at The Grange was class, the set-up was class and they just donapost get the credit they deserve. Staff at Guyaposs and St Thomasapos Hospital and Nevill Hall were also amazing. Following his ordeal, Aled has urged people to follow government guidelines, wear masks and continue to get vaccinated, particularly with the new Omicron iant. He is now looking forward to playing more gigs with his two rock bands, De’Lour and Sentry, and continue running Unit  Music Studio as he strives to make a full recovery.

The League Against Cruel Sports video shows a fox fed to the dogs after being legally flushed out, the Daily Record reported. It follows another video published two weeks ago in which a man was seen tossing a fox to dogs and encouraging them to rip it apart at a hunt in Howwood, Renfrewshire.Robbie ­Marsland, spokesperson for the League Against Cruel Sports, said the footage showed that the cruelty involved in fox hunting is alive and well, despite the law banning the dogs from hunting down the animals in the traditional way. Mr Marsland said: “If hunts were obeying the law, the dogs would be used to flush a fox from cover where it could then be shot – but where’s the fun in that  “Traditional hunting ­celebrates the suffering and the kill. Throwing dead foxes to dogs ensures they continue to have the taste for blood, and subsequently the desire to kill. “The footage shows that hunters are not ready to give this element of their sport up. “It is just one of the routine and systematic ways the pro-hunting lobby uses to try to keep their cruel sport alive.”  The three latest incidents documented include the Fe Hunt, Lindores, in March , the Duke of Buccleuch Hunt in the Borders in March , and the Berwickshire Hunt in Abbey St Bathans in November . Each shows a dead fox being thrown to a pack of dogs. Although fox hunting with dogs was banned in Scotland in , an unlimited number of dogs are allowed to chase foxes from cover so they can be shot. Glasgow Hunt Sabs said members watched a fox being driven towards a line of guns and shot dead during the Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Hunt.  The group claimed they watched a “legal kill facilitated by illegal actions”, saying hunting laws were breached when the animal was chased by hounds over open ground. They said: “If it’s not illegal, it’s morally disgusting. Surely this isn’t pest control.” In April, the Scottish Greens called for a total ban on fox hunting, saying loopholes must be closed to put a stop to all “cruel” killings by hunts with dogs. The three hunts were approached for comment.

Emma Tustin, , was told she must serve a minimum of  years in prison after being found guilty of the murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, while his father Thomas Hughes, was told he must serve a minimum of  years for manslaughter. Solihull MP Julian Knight warned their case will be passed onto the Attorney General as he lay flowers outside Arthuraposs home on Saturday, according to reports. It means there is a chance the pairaposs sentence could be extended. Speaking in Solihull on Saturday, Mr Knight said to the Daily Mail : There’s a palpable sense of real loss and tragedy over this and also, frankly, a sense of anger, and questions over how this was allowed to happen, how these monsters were allowed to inflict this horrible torture on this young, defenceless boy.My view is very simple on this. We need to get to the bottom of how this happened and we need to ensure that those who have failed him are accountable. But also I think anyone reflecting on those sentences yesterday thinks that they were too lenient and my intention is to refer this to the unduly lenient sentencing scheme as soon as possible and I will be doing that on Monday morning. Arthur was left with an unsurvivable brain injury while in the sole care of evil Tustin. She was jailed for le with a minimum term of  years at Coventry Crown Court on Friday, after being convicted of murder by assaulting defenceless Arthur in the hallway of her home in Solihull, on June , . Arthur, whose body was also covered in  bruises, died in hospital the next day.  Manipulative and calculating Tustin was unanimously convicted after an eight-week trial trial, with the boyaposs pitiless father Hughes found guilty of his manslaughter, after encouraging the killing. Hughesapos infatuation for Tustin had obliterated any love for his son, the sentencing judge said.

The -year-old creates the display each year to raise money for GOSH and other charities, but decided to raise funds for the cancer charity this year following his treatment. Mr Elliott was diagnosed with leukaemia in February . He created a pared-down display last year as he had Covid- at the time. However this year the display has ed to its full glory and features Santaaposs grotto with rocking horses, five Father Christmases, elves, reindeer and stars  . There is also a ft star on the roof of his home, which he shares with his partner Lesley Haylett, . Mr Elliott said: Iaposve been doing it every year for about  years. Every year I try to do something dferent - so Iaposve built gingerbread houses, castles, piratesapos things, lots of dferent things. Every year we raise money for GOSH because my grandchild was in Great Ormond Street years ago, and this year Leukaemia Care, because theyaposve been really supportive after I was told my blood count was low and needed to be checked out. I just think itaposs a good way to show your appreciation. He added: It started off with just a string of lights. Weaposve got some elderly people who live across the road and they sent us a Christmas card saying how much they liked the lights, and itaposs just grown from there. People come and see it from all over. One feature from the coupleaposs display is missing this year. Two ft statues of comics Laurel and Hardy, which Ms Haylett bought for her partner  years ago, were stolen from outside their home in the summer.  A £, reward for their safehas been offered by Dean Floyd, on behalf of his construction company, Chigwell Group, but the statues have not been seen since. It was the fourth time they had been stolen. Last time they ed after three years. Mr Elliott said: Hopefully theyaposll come back. I was gutted when they were nicked again. The house is known for them and the Christmas decorations. I found out theyaposd been taken when I was in hospital for a bone marrow transplant. They didnapost want to tell me theyaposd gone again. He added that he was delighted that he was able to make the display this year as it was a little touch and go because of his diagnosis. It feels terric to see it done, he said. Ms Haylett said: Weaposre really proud of him. A lot of people get cancer and then just lock themselves away. But heaposs just been trying to carry on as he always does.

Anita Bentonaposs face swelled dramatically and her skin erupted in a red, lumpy rash after dying her hair using the Schwarzkopf product last month, she has claimed. The -year-old said she was temporarily blinded for four days and fears sheaposll have permanent eyelid damage after suffering a severe allergic reaction to the Schwarzkopf Live dye in shade Cosmic Blue. Anita thought she wouldnapost need a patch test as she has used the product every six to eight weeks since  with no problems. But just  minutes after applying the dye on October , the mum-of-three claims her scalp started aposburningapos.  The following day it was weeping so much her hair aposstuck to her headapos. Over the next two days her Anitaaposs ballooned, swelling so much so her eyelids closed over, leaving her unable to see and forcing her to take a week off work. Anitaaposs concerned boss asked for pictures of her medication to prove she was having an allergic reaction and wasnapost the victim of a vicious beating - while even her own dad didnapost recognise her. A Schwarzkopf spokesman said they have offered expert help to identy the cause of her reaction and urge everyone to an allergy alert test before using hair colour. Anita, from Sheldon, West Midlands, said: I looked like Elephant Man. I took a selfie and sent it to my dad and he replied aposwhoaposs that apos. Even my own dad couldnapost recognise me. My manager asked me to send her pictures of my medication to prove I hadnapost been beaten up and that it was actually an allergic reaction. Iaposm never dying my hair again, Iaposm going to go grey gracefully.  Anita was refreshing her hair colour using the dye in Cosmic Blue - a blue black shade sheaposd previously used with no problem. However, just  minutes after putting the product on her hair her scalp started burning so she washed it off. That evening her head started to itch and weep and she was unable to sleep due to the discomfort. Over the next two days her face ballooned, her eyes closed over and her head started to itch and weep. Anita called her GP at am on Monday, October th who suggested she go to Birmingham Midland Eye Centre. There, doctors ran tests and referred her to Heartlands Hospitalaposs AE department in Birmingham, West Midlands, where she was prescribed steroids and antibiotics. Days later the swelling started to subside but then Anita broke out in a lumpy, itchy rash that required another two lots of steroids, steroid cream and stronger antihistamines.  Anita said: Iaposve naturally dark hair, I had a few greys coming through so I thought aposright letaposs sort those greys outapos. Iaposve been using the same hair dye since  and never had any problems. I donapost patch test every time, I just did it on the first one. You usually leave your hair dye on for half an hour, as per the instructions, I had it on  minutes and I could feel this burning and tingling feeling. Then the burning just got too much so I washed it off. On Sunday morning I woke up and all my hair was stuck to my head because it had been weeping throughout the night. Later in the night there was a little bit of swelling by my left temple. I didnapost manage to sleep that night, the stuff weeping out of my scalp was running down my face and it was so itchy, I was dying to scratch it. I phoned my GP, he asked me to send some photos and because my eyes were swollen he told me to go to the eye hospital. When I got outside the hospital I could feel both my eyes swelling up that much that they were closing. They put loads of drops in my eyes, said there was no problem with them, and said I needed to go to AE. As soon as the doctor there saw me he said straightaway aposhair dyeapos. He gave me steroids and antibiotics and told me to buy some Piriton to relieve the itching. Both of my eyes completely closed, I could only open my eyes on Thursday.  The swelling went from my eyes and dropped down into my cheeks so I looked like a hamster, then my skin broke out in a rash all over. There were bumps underneath my skin, it was that itchy I was ripping myself to pieces. I went back to the doctor and he said I had a skin infection and I had another two lots of steroids and stronger antihistamines and some steroid cream. All in all I had eight or nine dferent medications and I pay for my prescriptions. While in hospital waiting to be seen, Anita contacted Schwarzkopf in a bid to get to the bottom of what had triggered her reaction. Anita says she was told a aposminor change to the perfume ingredientapos had been made and the hair giant have also offered to pay for dermatological testing. After finishing her course of antibiotics, Anita is now fully recovered apart from a aposbaggyapos left eyelid that she hopes will go back to normal in due course. Anita said: Iaposm fully recovered and back to normal now. Where it swelled up my eyelid hasnapost gone back to normal, itaposs a bit baggier than it was, but I just keep putting on loads of cream and hoping for the best. I want to raise awareness because a lot of women like myself donapost do patch tests purely because weaposve been using the same hair dye for years and years. These companies change their products all of the time, all they need to do is put a little sticker on that says aposnew and improved, please re-do your patch testapos. A Schwarzkopf spokesperson said: We were sorry to hear about Anita Bentonaposs experience and wish her a speedy recovery. She has been in contact with us and we have offered expert help to identy the cause of her reaction. We urge everyone to read the instructions and do an allergy alert test before using hair colour, eventhey have used the brand or specic colour before, as allergies can build up over time.

She said: It was like something out of a Hollywood film, and after I had got over the shock I just assumed that someone would realise that they had made a huge mistake and that they would swtly take the money back.  But no one did, and the money just sat in my account.”With the money still in her account, Peters contacted thenewspaper because she wanted tothe enormous sum.Peters said: I assumed that HMRC staff would notice their mistake when I paid my tax in November , but nothing happened. “I even tried to ring HMRC but getting hold of anyone at the time was impossible. I’d wait  minutes on the phone and then would have to give up as my child would need to be fed, or something.  “On other calls, I would be cut off before I could talk to someone. I moved £, into my savings account but it has earned virtually no interest. I have never been wealthy and don’t have a car or even a dog. My income had been decimated and all the time I was very gently eating into the money. But because I could no longer pay the whole sum back I was stuck in a catch- position. I had a whole load of money I knew I couldn’t spend, but I was unable to do anything about it in case HMRC wanted it all back at once.” After trying to get advice from a few people, she was met with ied words of wisdom.  Some told her to do nothing with the money while others advised her to invest it in shares or property, hoping no one would ask for the money back. Out of desperation to recover the money she spent, Peters considered investing the cash into cryptocurrency.discovered that HMRC staff made the payment by accident after trying to pay Peters a £. parcel customs duty rebate. Had she never came forward, thereaposs a good chance the payment would never have been discovered. Upon discovering the mistake, HMRC brought up a case on behalf of Section A of the Theft Act . The law states that keeping wrongful credit and not taking reasonable steps to cancel the credit is unlawful. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to the inidual, a HMRC spokesperson said. We are working to recover the payment that was made. For the amount that the inidual spent, we will work with them to come to a payment arrangement that takes into account their financial circumstances. Peters will apparently be contacted by debt management advisers to establish a reasonable way to pay the money back with monthly payments. She has offered to pay back the balance over a span of five years.

His mum gave birth when she was  weeks pregnant in a bid to repair his spine. She has now thanked medical staffDeborah and David with their baby Preston at his christening Image: chroniclelive BySophie FinneganChiara FiorilloNews Reporter:,  Dec | commentsA mum has thanked medical staff who helped her Christmas miracle baby who was diagnosed with a devastating health condition. Preston Mark Middleton was diagnosed with Spina Bida, which happens when a babyaposs spine and spinal cord does not develop properly in the womb, causing a gap in the spine. Doctors also found the little boy had Hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluid in the brain.The excess fluid puts pressure on the brain, which can damage it, the NHS explains. Mum Deborah, , underwent fetal surgery in Belgium when she was  weeks pregnant in a bid to repair her sonaposs spine, Chronicle Live reports.Now, the woman and the boyaposs dad David, , have thanked hospital staff as the family prepares to celebrate their first Christmas together, with Preston approaching his first birthday.  Deborah said: Me and David are so incredibly grateful for all the staff that helped us. We didnapost know what the surgery would be like, we didnapost know how Preston would be now. We do know itaposs helped him a great deal, heaposs meeting all his milestones and doing everything a typical child does. Weaposre incredibly grateful to the NHS who talked us through the surgery and gave it as an option. Weaposre just so blessed we were actually able to get the surgery as there is a lot of criteria to meet and some families arenapost as lucky as us.Deborah said she was told during her -week pregnancy scan that something was not quite right and that there was an abnormality in Prestonaposs brain. The following week, the mum had an appointment at Newcastleaposs Royal Victoria Infirmary where doctors confirmed that Preston had the birth defect which can cause weakness or total paralysis of the legs. The condition also caused a Chiari II malformation, a condition of the cerebellum that can put pressure on parts of the brain and spinal cord. Following the fetal surgery, Preston was born via a C-section on December , , but remained in intensive care while doctors monitored his progress before ing home on December . Due to hospital appointments and lockdowns, last year the family could not celebrate Christmas, but they are now looking forward to the festive period.  Deborah said: Preston was born on December  and we werenapost surewe would be able to leave the hospital for Christmas Day but we came home the day before Christmas Eve which was just amazing. We got to spend Christmas together as a family with our parents and it was lovely but I feel like this Christmas is our first proper one. Last year we had just got out of the hospital and we were in lockdown and now Preston is a bit older heaposs starting to take notice of everything. Just to be able to do all the festive activities with him and live a relatively typical le is just amazing. We have been to see Santa and weaposve planned Prestonaposs first birthday party. It will be really good to get family and friends together to celebrate after everything weaposve been through and everything everyone has been through with lockdown.  Deborah has thanked her loved ones for all their support, adding: David has been amazing with how strong he has been and how well he has coped with everything. I couldnapost wish for a better husband and a better father for Preston. I donapost know where Iaposd be without my mam too, weaposre really close. Deborah and David have since thanked all the NHS staff at the RVI Newcastle and neonatal intensive care as well as the team in Belgium for carrying out the fetal surgery. After initially being given a bleak outlook, Deborah said Preston has come on leaps and bounds and is meeting all his key milestones one year on calling him their Christmas miracle. She said: We didnapost know what to think when we got the diagnosis, I probably didnapost think Preston would ever do the things heaposs doing now. They didnapost think Preston would be able to sit unaided so to see him doing all these things is incredible. I think you take for granted all these little milestones but for Preston, itaposs a huge accomplishment. Heaposs amazed medical staff. He really is a Christmas miracle and he makes us proud every day.

Now she is facing another tough battleSarah Bennett discovered she had liver and spine cancer just a few months after getting the all clear for breast cancer Image: MEN MEDIAByEthan DaviesLucy SkouldingFreelance writer:,  Dec | commentsA mum of two was given a devastating double cancer diagnosis at the age of  after she complained of back ache.Sarah Bennett, from Edgeley, Stockport, has been diagnosed with liver and spine cancer just a few months after getting the all clear for breast cancer. She was first diagnosed with the disease in May  but got the all clear for it at the Christie Hospital  months later, reports the Manchester Evening News.Sadly, just a few months on from that moment, new scans found Sarah’s cancer had spread to her liver and spine, meaning she will have to undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy simultaneously long-term. The secondary cancer was only found after she had a back ache — with nurses initially not worried about her pain. “I had a back ache and I rang my breast care nurse,” Sarah told the Manchester Evening News.  “She organised my scans to ease my mind. “She was not worried. “Then they found it in my liver and spine. It is really scary.” The latest cancer means doctors cannot give her a le expectancy for certain. “Realistically, I am not going to be here into old age,” Sarah added. “It has just been a bit of head f***.” “[Last year], I went into battle. You just get through treatment and carry on. After I finished, I struggled, because it’s almost like trauma. “Then I got the all-clear, but it did not stop there, as I had hormonal treatment so I was on medically-induced menopause. “Then, I got this diagnosis. “With the secondary one there’s no cure. They cannot give you a time scale, so you are living between scans.” To combat the latest cancers, Sarah has now started to have three weeks of chemotherapy every month to treat her liver, with radiotherapy for her back. The ‘anxiety’ of treatment, and uncertainty of not knowing how long she has left, is worsened by the fact that Sarah has a young family. The -year-old added: “If it was just me, I would crack on — but with the kids, they are too young to know what’s happening.” Along with Sarah is her fiance Ryan, and children Toby, age seven, and Maggie, who is two-years-old. Following the desperate news, friends of the family have rushed to Sarah’s aid.One friend who has stepped up is Jo Daly, who has set up anonline fundraiserto help the family pay the bills.Their financial concerns are heightened by the fact that both parents are self-employed, with Ryan a plasterer and Sarah a hairdresser, so when the pair cannot work, earnings take a hit. Jo told the Manchester Evening News: “They had two incomes and now they have half of one. “I would love to be able to write a cheque but we are not able to. Nobody is able to do it. “They just need to have that worry about paying the bills [removed]. “It is tragic that this is the situation and their biggest worry is money.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsBack painBreast cancerLe expectancyCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Critics say it undermines Charles’ Cop proclamation last month when he told the world: “We have to reduce emissions urgently. “We have to put ourselves on what might be called a war-like footing. We know what we must do.” The heir to the throne could have reduced his own impact on the planet by taking his electric vehicle to the Voyager aircraft’s usual home, RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Instead it was flown to RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, nearer Sandringham, ahead of Charles’ trip for a ceremony removing the Queen as head of state. It saved him just two hours of driving time. Graham Smith of campaign group Republic accused Charles of “staggering hypocrisy” and called the flight a waste of taxpayers’ money and RAF resources. Matt Finch, of Transport  Environment, added: “For long distances we can’t avoid air travel, but for domestic travel, anyone should avoid flying and use other forms of transport.”  Charles, who has previously urged all of his staff to cycle to work, has championed the use of biofuels blended with normal aviation fuel as a transitional step towards creating carbon-free flight. The voyager, an Airbus A also used by senior Government ministers, is the first RAF plane to run on the “sustainable” option, but critics say it is still very harmful to the environment. Manufacturers claim it can cut a plane’s carbon emissions by up to  per cent, over its le cycle. But it is mixed with conventional jet fuel and scientists are unclear on how green it is. The prince is often driven to royal engagements in an all-electric Jaguar I-Pace SUV. And he also owns an Aston Martin DB, which he has said is powered by “surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process”. Last month, Charles spoke of his passion for environmental issues during Cop in Glasgow and said world leaders need to do more than “just talk”, as he admitted he himself had been doing for the past  years. Today a Clarence House spokesman said: “The prince has campaigned for a sht towards sustainable aviation fuel as air travel is a crucial part of his work. “As a result, this autumn the RAF introduced for the first time sustainable fuel and deployed it for this trip.

And it seems Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louisaposs granny is no exception. Carole Middleton, mum of the Duchess of Cambridge, once revealed the very festive treat she gives her grandchildren at her house each year. In a previous interview, she told how she likes to spoil the little ones - by giving them their own Christmas tree in their bedrooms. She told theshe likes to have as many trees around the house as possible, including one in each of the grandchildrenaposs rooms so they can decorate it themselves.  The future kingaposs grandmother is said to have then taken a long pause, before admitting: That makes me sound as though I live in a mansion, doesnapost it  As well as daughter Kateaposs children, Carole is also a proud grandmother to her other daughter Pippaaposs children - Arthur and Grace - she shares with husband James Matthews. But despite getting their own trees at their grannyaposs house, one royal expert says Kate and her husband Prince William will be sure to try not to spoil George, Charlotte and Louis too much.

Royal expert Duncan Larcombe has said the couple will want their children to feel normal and won’t be lavishing them with expensive gts. Mr Larcombe told OK! that the family will be celebrating Christmas on their own, together with the more formal event at Sandringham with Williamaposs family and spending time with Kate’s family.  He said: I think we’re looking at three Christmases rolled into one for William and Kate and their children. “There will be Christmas on their own with their kids, the more formal celebrations at Sandringham with William’s family and then time with Kate’s family, the Middletons. But something we know for sure about William and Kate is that they want their children to feel normal and so they certainly won’t be lavishing them with expensive gts, that’s for certain. They won’t let them be spoiled.” William and Kate are likely to head to their beloved country home, Anmer Hall in Norfolk, on the Sandringham estate, as soon as they’re free of commitments in the run-up to the big day. They are then expected to join the Queen and other members of the Royal Family at Sandringham House on Christmas Day and attend the traditional church service.

He had raised £, for Make-A-Wish UK and liked their work so much he began volunteering for them.Four years later, the dad of two was on the set of Coronation Street with his young daughter Hannah as she was granted a wish by the charity after being diagnosed with cancer.“After seeing the whole process from the inside and helping families through the most heartbreaking moments of their lives, suddenly the roles were reversed,” says Simon. “I found myself on the other side, turning to Make-A-Wish for something that could bring comfort and joy to my own sick child.  “When we found out how ill Hannah was, our world fell apart.” He was an environmental health officer with the RAF in  when -year-old Hannah was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive soft tissue cancer. It was already stage four. Simon, , says: “By this point I’d volunteered with Make-A-Wish for three years and I’d always been in awe of how families I met dealt with what they were facing. I’d felt huge empathy for them, but I never pictured myself going through it.” Online: www.make-a-wish.org.uk mirror Text: To donate £ text the word LIGHT to .

Post: Please post cheques payable to MAKE-A-WISH UK to Freepost address below: Freepost Plus RUCS-LHTL-CJGU Make-A-Wish Mirror Appeal Make-A-Wish UK, Seventh Floor, Thames Tower, Station Road, Reading, Berkshire RG LX Hannah had a six-month course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Simon says: “She lost all her hair and parts of that time felt horric. “But Hannah was brilliant. However horrible it got, she kept on smiling. She was inspirational.” Afterwards, things seemed hopeful. She continued with maintenance chemo and, as her strength built up and her hair started to grow back, Simon and we Donna, , had more reason to be positive. They then decided to reach out to Make-A-Wish UK, this year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal charity. Simon, of Sleaford, Lincs, says: “I’d seen how having a wish granted could give families a real lt.” Hannah, then , asked the charity to arrange a Corrie visit for her and her family. Simon says the treat in November  was “wonderful”. He adds: “Make-A-Wish arranged a trip to Manchester over a couple of days. We were picked up in a limo from our hotel and taken to Granada Studios. By Jason Beattie For the majority of families this Christmas will be a joyous time of presents, food and fun. But for some children the festive season will be very dferent. Across the country there are more than , young people who are critically ill. Many will be spending what should be a special time of the year in hospital. Others will have to have treatment, scans or blood tests. With your help we can give them a Christmas that they will always remember. This year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal is raising funds for Make-A-Wish UK that helps seriously ill young people make their dreams come true.It could be they want to meet their hero or heroine or feed an animal at the zoo or travel to see Santa in Lapland. The money raised could help Joshua, six, who has severe epilepsy, achieve his wish of a bedroom makeover or Summer, also six, who has acute leukaemia and dreams of a bouncy castle. Each year Make-A-Wish helps hundreds of critically ill children achieve their letime’s ambition. But to make a wish come true takes an army of volunteers, supporters and donors. That’s why every penny you donate could make a dference. Granting a wish can transform a child’s le. It gives them something to look forward to. For others it provides a special memory which makes the treatment they need more bearable.It can also help their parents who, despite doing everything they can for their sick child, feel it is not enough. Jason Suckley, Make-A-Wish UK chief executive, said: “I met the family of a boy who was recovering from brain surgery. “His grandmother told me how dficult it had been for her to watch her daughter struggle with the challenges of her son’s condition.But while they were enjoying his wish together, her daughter turned to her and said, ‘There is still magic in this world isn’t there mum ’ . “That’s just one instance that illustrates how the power of a wish lies in sharing positive memories with loved ones. “Every donation from Mirror readers will help us create those memories – bringing joy to ill children and their families during the darkest of times.” “Hannah loved it. I remember we were greeted by Kate Ford, who plays Tracy Barlow, and she was lovely to us all. “Hannah loved walking around the set and seeing the cast. She got lots of autographs and loved meeting David Neilson, who plays Roy Cropper.” Hannah and her older brother Callum even had a stint as extras. Simon says: “She could feel normal for a day. She could forget about hospitals and scans and chemo and have a fun day with her family where none of that mattered.”  Then, just after Christmas in , Hannah noticed a lump in her neck and was taken back to hospital. It was on the day her appearance on Corrie was broadcast in January  that doctors gave the family the news that she had relapsed. “Still we hoped for a miracle,” says Simon, who will share her story at tonight’s Make-A-Wish Ball in London. She had more chemo but by September doctors said there was nothing more they could do. “We took her home from hospital and had her there for six days before we lost her on September , ,” Simon says. He adds his involvement with the charity gave him – as well as his we and son Callum, now  – a reason to stay positive.  Simon says: “Everyone is dferent in how they grieve, but for me carrying on with Make-A-Wish helped.” The year after Hannah’s death, Simon set about an amazing challenge in her honour. “She was  when we lost her,” he says. “So I decided to do  half marathons. I raised money for a number of charities, including Make-A-Wish. “I had a sign with me with a picture of Hannah. Every time I was struggling I remembered all she had been through and it helped me keep going.” He still volunteers with the charity and says of the granted wish: “We’ll never forget the joy it brought her.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON David NeilsonKate FordCoronation StreetHospitalsSoap operasCancerMirror Christmas appealXmas Appeal \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Dont miss out on the biggest soaps gossip!

A survival trainer involved with the case told detectives in an email that it was likely the couple died while attempting to save their infant daughter.Sadly, I believe they were caught off guard, and once they realised their situation, they died trying to save their child and each other,apos the unidentied trainer said, according to the Daily Mail.  It is likely the child began to succumb first, which hurried the parentsapos efforts up the hill. When one could no longer continue, they stayed behind to care for the child and pet, while the other tried to forge on and get help for their loved ones. It is a tragedy of the highest order. Detectives had a number of theories behind their deaths, which included suicide, being poisoned by toxic material, in the water, or a freak lightening strike.  But police have since confirmed the group died from hyperthermia and dehydration. Their eight-year-old dog Oski also suffered a heat-related death, police said. Jonathan, Ellen and Muji were found . miles from their vehicle in temperatures which could have soared above F , Mariposa County Sherf Jeremy Briese said.  They were found with one empty water bottle and a bottle of formula between them, which indicated the heat and lack of sustenance likely contributed to their death.

This startling piece of information comes courtesy of YouTuberTom Scott, who revealed in a recent video that many chippies instead use something known as a non-brewed condiment in place of vinegar. Youaposve probably never been able to tell the dference between the two, as it looks very similar to the real thing and only tastes slightly dferent. A non-brewed condiment is a malt vinegar substitute made from water, acetic acid and ious flavourings - yummy! It takes less time to make than actual vinegar and can be purchased in concentrated form.  It also possesses several other benefits that the real stuff doesnapost have. For example, it doesnapost contain any alcohol, making it halal and a great choice for teetotal customers. Some batches of the condiment are also gluten-free, meaning businesses can cater to a wider range of people with it. But the real question is, will discovering this industry apossecretapos put you off using the aposvinegarapos in fish and chip shops in the future  Let us know in the comments below.

The tragic discovery was made after a local spotted leless bodies through the window of the Senzig home, south of Berlin.Details about the horric incident remain few and far between, although it has been claimed that the family were in Covid quarantine at the time of their deaths, Bild reported. According to senior Public Prosecutor Gernot Bantleon, the five dead are two adults and three children. The corpses had gunshot and stab wounds, he said.  The two adults are  and the three children are four, eight and ten-years-old.The homicide squad is activated because a homicide must be assumed, the spokesman continued.It is not clear whether the dead people were a family or whether anyone  was involved in the incident. Mr Bantleon said: “The homicide squad and forensics are at the crime scene in Senzig. A public prosecutor from the express service determined for capital crimes. This afternoon the blinds were pulled down at the house while forensic investigators were seen entering and leaving the building. Firefighters were seen taking a pet out of the home in a box. Police officers were seen going door-to-door along the street speaking to neighbours. A reporter for Bild asked a man and a woman who were putting a candle near the house whether they knew the dead.

A health official has said the increase should not prompt panic because children have mild disease according to cliniciansapos reports.A large number of children were admitted with coronavirus last month in Tshwane, the metropolitan area that includes the capital Pretoria, raising concerns that the newly identied Omicron could pose greater risks for young children than other iants.Scientists have yet to confirm any link and have cautioned that other factors could be at play. Ntsakisi Maluleke, a public health specialist in the Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg, told Reuters that out of the , COVID-positive patients in hospitals in the province  were under  years old. This is a greater proportion than during previous waves of infection. We are comforted by cliniciansapos reports that the children have mild disease, she said in an interview, adding healthofficials and scientists were investigating what was driving increased admissions in younger ages and were hoping to provide more clarity within two weeks.Since only a small percentage of South Africaaposs positive COVID- tests are sent for genomic sequencing, officials do not yet know which iants the children admitted to hospital have been infected with. Maluleke said healthcare workers could be acting out of an abundance of caution.  They would rather have a child under care for a day or two than having a child at home and complicating, ... but we really need to wait for the evidence, she said. She said many Covid- patients in Gauteng were reporting non-specic flu-like symptoms like a scratchy throat. But she urged parents and pregnant women, another cohort that has seen more hospital admissions recently, not to take flu-like symptoms lightly and to get tested in case intervention is needed further down the line.The public needs to be less fearful but vigilant, she said. Despite a recent influx of admissions, Gautengaposs dedicatedCovid- bed occupancy was still only around %, Maluleke said. Scientists are yet to determine what severity of illness is caused by the Omicron iant, first detected in southern Africa last month and since seen in more than  countries, and whether it may be more resistant to existing vaccines. But an article by the South African Medical Research Council based on early observations at the Steve Biko Tshwane District Hospital Complex in Pretoria over the last two weeks contained reassuring signs.The majority of patients in the Covid wards at the hospital complex were not oxygen-dependent and were incidental Covid admissions, having another reason for admission, the articlesaid.This is a picture that has not been seen in previous waves. In the beginning of all three previous waves and throughout the course of these waves, there has always only been a sprinkling of patients on room air in the Covid ward, it said.There had been no Covid-related deaths among  admissions in the paediatric Covid wards over the last two weeks. But the article added that trends would become clearer and further analysis was still being conducted.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsFluCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Hippos Imani, aged , and -year-old Hermien have no symptoms apart from a runny nose, but the zoo said the pair had been put into quarantine as a precaution. To my knowledge, this is the first time in this species. Worldwide, this virus has been reported mainly in great apes and felines, said the zooaposs vet, Francis Vercammen.Pets including cats, dogs and ferrets have become infected following contact with their owners, while in zoos, cases have been reported in animals such as big cats, otters, primates and hyenas. The disease has also spread in mink farms and to wild animals, such as deer. Antwerp Zoo is investigating the causes of the contagion. None of the zookeepers had recently shown COVID- symptoms or tested positive for the virus, the zoo said.  Last month a pet dog became the first pooch to become infected with the virus in the UK. The pup apparently caught the virus from its owners. The infection was confirmed following tests at the Animal and Plant Health Agencylaboratory in Weybridge, Surrey, last week.It is believed the dog, which is recovering at home, contracted coronavirus from its owners, who had previously tested positive for the virus.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ZoosAnimalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

They have no control over pricing and stocking policy, which is decided by the board.#Stressing that the supermarket operates a UK pricing policy, a Co-op spokesperson said: #Co-op is committed to serving and supporting its rural communities, conveniently, including areas where other retailers often do not trade due to the increased operational costs.#Like all retailers, Co-op has experienced some patchy disruption to the availability of some products, and it is working with suppliers to re-stock as quickly as possible.#Alongside well-known brands, Co-op#s award-winning own-brand products provide shoppers with choice # delivering quality and value, while also enabling customers and community causes to unlock additional value and benefits through its membership programme.#Mr Bates added: #The Co-op bosses in Manchester need to realise that the Tarbert Co-op and others in rural locations are not convenience stores. These are often the only store for miles and are therefore leline stores.#If they do not understand this, then they do not understand the communities they are serving.#Speaking on Wednesday this week, Mr Bates said he had received no reply from Co-op management.He said ##apart from an automated receipt reply, I have heard nothing further.

claims he contacted Lothian Buses three times to organise a meeting to discuss the future of the service, before he received a response.The X bus was suspended last year by East Coast Buses, a subsidiary of Lothian Buses, following the introduction of national lockdown restrictions.The service ran through North Berwick, Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry, then directly to Edinburgh via the A.Commuters from Dirleton, Gullane and Aberlady now face an extra hour in their daily commute to Edinburgh using the  bus service, which stops at Prestonpans, Wallyford, Musselburgh and Portobello.An online petition launched by Mr Hoy calling for the reinstatement of the service has now received more than  signatures.Mr Hoy said: ldquoIn early October, my office contacted East Coast Buses, who issued a standard response outlining the reasons for continued withdrawal of the service, including challenges with recruitment, the need to prioritise key services and the focus on delivering the  service.ldquoI recognise these challenges, but I also recognise they apply across all routes across the whole of the Lothians and are not confined to the X route.ldquoAfter a number of residents living in Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry reached out to me about the X bus, I launched a petition calling for the reinstatement of the service.ldquoI wrote to East Coast Buses on two occasions requesting a face-to-face meeting, and followed this up with a third letter to the interim managing director of Lothian Buses.ldquoLothian Buses is owned by the four Lothian council areas, which includes East Lothian Council. That makes it accountable to the residents of our community.ldquoThe number of signatures on the petition shows the clear strength of feeling in the area about reinstating the X bus.ldquoAt this point, Lothian Buses have their heads buried in the sand ndash they cannot keep ignoring our communities.In a letter to Mr Hoy dated November , Nigel Serafini, interim managing director of Lothian Buses, said it was the companyrsquos ldquopriority to re-establish the X ldquoas soon as driver resource permits.He added: ldquoThe X covers no additional areas that service  does not .ldquoIn contrast, the X is the only service that operates to East Linton, West Barns and Dunbar. Without the X these communities would be without a regular bus service whilst, as explained, the same is not true of Gullane, Aberlady and Dirleton.A spokesperson for East Coast Buses added: ldquoEast Coast Buses is absolutely committed to delivering for all of our customers in East Lothian.ldquoLike many other transport providers at this time, we are in an extremely challenging recruitment market, which, coupled with our safety protocols for colleagues who find themselves in the Covid- track and trace cycle, means that we are experiencing signicant resourcing dficulties in our driving team on a day-to-day basis.ldquoWith limited available resource, we have made the dficult decision to prioritise key services which provide as many transport links as possible throughout East Lothian. In terms of service provision for Gullane and Aberlady, we have focused on delivering service , which provides critical local links along the coast as well as direct travel to Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"fate-rail-underpass-depends-new-housing-scheme-decision-dunbar","story":"Hundreds of new homes have been built at Hallhill, south of the railway line, in Dunbar in recent years.However, pedestrian links between the new homes and the older section of Dunbar are limited.East Lothian Council is keen to see a new pedestrian underpass to improve connections, which could be financed in part through another housing development in the area.It is expected that the cost of the underpass would be more than pound million, with part of the cost being covered by the Hallhill North development, which would consist of  houses and  flats.A decision is set to be made on the plans, which come from Taylor Wimpey East Scotland and Hallhill Developments Limited, at a meeting of East Lothian Councilrsquos planning committee on Tuesday.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who chairs the local authorityrsquos planning committee and represents Dunbar on East Lothian Council, noted that currently the only pedestrian access in the area was under the railway line beside Hallhill Sports Centre.He said: ldquoAs part of the application, the developer will be making a contribution to a new underpass at the railway.ldquoThere will not be enough funding coming from the developer to completely do this underpass.ldquoThat has to be done through grant funding from other agencies and the council themselves.ldquoAt the moment, all the houses from the Hallhill area to get to both the lower primary school and secondary school have to come underneath the tunnel, and children going to the Lochend Campus have to come back through that one.ldquoIt is really congested and we definitely need another way through there.An underpass was previously in place under the railway line but it was blocked up a number of years ago.Network Rail was approached about seeing it reopened but was not keen on the idea and East Lothian Council would have been liable for the structure.Mr Hampshire said: ldquoWe have to go with a completely new cut-through for pedestrians and cyclists, which will come through into Ash Grove swing park area but will be a safe route to get to the secondary school.Drawings and documents for the planning application were first submitted to East Lothian Councilrsquos planning department at the beginning of February last year.The scheme, to the west of the primary schoolrsquos Lochend Campus, originally featured  houses and  apartments."},{"url":null,"title":"storyteller-tim-porteus-standing-greens-preston-seton-gosford-by-election","story":"The -year-old, from Prestonpans, will also stand for the party in the ward at the full East Lothian Council elections next May.The early years charity worker ndash who writes the weekly Timrsquos Tales column for the Courier ndash works in Midlothian assisting children and families, and lives with his we Kate and three youngest children.Mr Porteus said: ldquoI am standing because I believe my community has amazing assets in its people and beautul natural setting, but we also have our issues that need to be addressed.ldquoI am passionate about education and childrenrsquos wellbeing but, here in East Lothian, we see signicant local issues around education provision and opportunities for our young people.ldquoThey have also been very adversely affected by Covid restrictions.

The boys and I used to vie with each other as to who could eat the most on Christmas Day. Oyster Soup and Turbot went down with undue zest, but then came Roast Turkey, Boiled Turkey and an enormous Sirloin of Beef. The boys and I had two helpings of all three! We then had Plum Pudding, Mince-Pies, Trle and every kind of dessert. During the afternoon we ate chocolates solidly. We neither felt, nor were, sick!Christiersquos cast-iron digestion would have won approval from the Tudors, to whom lavish Christmas feasting is generally attributed. By comparison, though, Christiersquos experience was modest to the point of humble.In this lively resume of Christmas fare down the centuries, food writer and historian Annie Gray shows that Christmas has been a time of excessive consumption since it began. In the Middle Ages, December was preceded by  days of fasting. Thereafter, there was licence for  days of unbridled gorging and imbibing.Even now, the average Christmas meal contains  calories. The courses offered might be vastly dferent from those on medieval trencher boards and yet we like to think we are part of an unbroken chain of tradition. As Gray writes: ldquoWe cling to Christmas dinner as a point of stability even as our culinary tastes expand, but itrsquos built on shting sands.Those shting sands are the subject of At Christmas We Feast. Beginning around the fourth century, when the date for celebrations was fixed on the calendar in late December, Gray takes readers on a cookrsquos tour that explains what we eat today, and why. By comparison with stuffed boarsrsquo heads or game pie of yore, todayrsquos much-vaunted pigs in blankets are ldquoa positive usurper.The focus of Grayrsquos attention is the English experience, not least because Scotland was loath to adopt what it regarded as a pre-Reformation abomination. Here, December  was only finally honoured as a public holiday in . My London mother, arriving in Edinburgh eight years earlier, was appalled to discover that people went to work on Christmas Day, and spent their energy and money on Hogmanay instead.Distinguished by the insight and knowledge of a culinary expert, Grayrsquos history showcases the dishes that came to symbolise not just Christmas but Britishness. Top of a very extensive list were beef and plum pudding, which will still sound mouth-watering to many. Asshe were tracing a family tree, she explains how early puddingsand mincemeat made from offal or meat morphed into Christmas pudding and mince pies.The importance of meat to the occasion can be traced back to the festivitiesrsquo origins. The scale on which fowl, game and pigs were slaughtered was almost genocidal, and distressed some early onlookers. One th-century observer commented that: ldquoCapons and hennes, besides turkies, geese and duckes, besides beefe and mutton, all die for the great feast. By the th century, the rich expected game pies with at least five creatures encased within pastry walls so thick they were more like ramparts. One spectacular pie was nine feet in diameter, and weighed around  stone. It contained ldquo geese,  turkeys,  rabbits,  wild ducks,  woodcocks,  snipes,  partridges,  calvesrsquo tongues,  curlews,  blackbirds,  pigeons.Turkeys began arriving in the th century, after their discovery in the South Americas. One Yorkshireman, who was instrumental in their introduction, had a turkey added to his family coat of arms in . By the th century, Norfolk was the heart of turkey farming, providing London with its birds. Such was the size of flocks herded towards the capital in December that traffic came to a halt. This trade was so profitable that some coach drivers filled their seats with turkeys instead of passengers.Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was around this time that people began complaining of the growing commercialisation of the festive season. By George Bernard Shawrsquos era, when it was embraced with the same gusto as today, he bitterly bemoaned its excess: ldquoWe must be gluttonous because it is Christmas. We must be drunken because it is Christmas. We must be insincerely generous we must buy things nobody wants, and give them to people we donrsquot like hellipBut Scrooges are easily ignored, as they deserve. Indeed, writes Gray, Charles Dickens, who is often credited with creating the modern Christmas, was merely tapping into the general mood when he published A Christmas Carol in . By the mid-th century, the need to look out for others as well as ourselves at the yearrsquos nadir was gaining popularity. Punch, not widely known for its social conscience, asked its readers what they had done for others: ldquoNothing  Do you dare, with those sirloin cheeks and that port-wine nose, to answer ndash nothing Bringing the story into the modern age, Gray shows the inventiveness ndash and dreariness ndash of Christmas on a ration book, when a tin of turkey used up a monthrsquos worth of points. She quotes from Delia Smithrsquos Christmaswhere, with the precision of a railway timetable, she creates a punishing two-day schedule for those preparing the feast all by themselves. In my family there were more than a few who treated this book like a bible.Interspersed with recipes from as far back as the th century, At Christmas We Feast is filled with fascinating facts and foods. While few of us are likely to attempt the instructions for making mincemeat using calvesrsquo feet or tripe, some concoctions, such as Wassail with roasted apples, are decidedly tempting.It would be far too easy ndash and hypocritical ndash to regard the gluttony of the past with disdain. Gray neither sneers at suet, nor derides fruit cake richer than foie gras. The spreads she details are described with more envy than dismay. For all its historical interest, it is this enthusiasm which gives the book its mouth-watering appeal, and infuses it with Christmas spirit."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13260804.jpg?type=article-full","title":"two-doors-bbc-scotland-comedy-returns-new-series","story":"Two Doors Down.Itrsquos back Affirmative.

I cant see the situation dramatically changing in the next couple of weeks - we have to watch this space...thats genuinely where we are scientically right now.\": Latest Omicron casein Scotland not connected to othersA total of  cases of the Omicron iant have been confirmed in Scotland so far,including at leastnine which are linked and have been traced back to a single private event held on November .It is unclear whether the three confirmedtoday- two in NHS Lanarkshire and one in the Greater Glasgow area- are linked to this event or separate.One caseidentied in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region, confirmed on Wednesday, was not linked to that event.The Omicron iant was first detected in Botswana in November and appears to be driving a rapid surge in Covid infections in South Africa, with signs that it is overtaking Delta as the dominant strain.There are concerns that its high number of mutations - including  on the spike protein used by the virus to infect cells - could make it more resistant to current vaccines and immunity.There are signs from Public Health Scotland data that the recent fall in Covid cases stopped on November  with a very small increase in positive cases by November If protection against infection is reduced, however, scientists remain confident that vaccines would still provide a strong defence against serious illness or death - as has already been seen following the emergence of the Delta strain.Prof Bauld said: \"I think we should be worried about Omicron because it really, genuinely does look more transmissible.\"We dont know about disease severity or immune escape from the vaccines, but we have confidence that eventhe vaccines are weakened in terms of transmission and infection that they will still work in terms of saving peoples lives basically. Even these current vaccines that we have.\"So I am worried, but Im not saying that these vaccines are useless - theyre still working and will still work, evennot as well, against Omicron.\": Abnormal spike in neonatal deaths not linked to Covid in mothers orbabiesProf Bauld told podcast listeners that it was \"absolutely imminent\" that boosters will be added to Scotlands vaccine passport apps, allowing people travelling abroad to show that they have had a third jag.Some countries are now requesting proof of boosters for entry as part of border controls, or for access into leisure and hospitality venues.However, Prof Bauld said she was not in favour of tougher rules on arrivals into the UK.The Scottish Government has asked Westminster to consider extending home self-isolation to eight days for travellers arriving from non-red list countries, with people only able to end self-isolationthey test negative for Covid on a PCR test taken on day eight.Currently, all arrivals have to take a PCR test within two days of entering the UK and remain in isolation until they receive a negative result.Prof Bauld said this was \"proportionate\".She added: \"Im really hopeful that we dont go in that direction [eight-day self-isolation] unless we absolutely have to.\"The main reason for that is that when you see domestic spread of this iant, then thinking about travel as the main source becomes less of an issue.\"Its too early to tellthat would occur - governments arent ruling it out - but its not the plan at the moment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"bird-flu-case-detected-flock-hens-dumfries-galloway","story":"The remaining birds at the premises, near Gretna, will be humanely culled and a km Protection Zone and km Surveillance Zone have been declared around the infected premises to limit the risk of spread of the disease.Within the zones, a range of dferent controls are now in place.

The forecasting ides the road network into inidual routes rather than geographic areas making it easier for decision makers to direct resources where they are needed most.#Each island is designated as a route, while the Mainland is ided into eight routes. Up until this year, the decision on how, and when, to treat the road network in the winter months has relied upon the information received from two weather stations at the Mill of Rango in Sandwick and at Kirkwall Airport, basically covering the East and West, while this has been helpful, it was a very broad brush.“The system is being closely monitored by officers throughout the winter season with view to summarise its performance at the conclusion of the trial next year. This will determinewe want to adopt this technology on a permanent basis.”Stressing that road safety remains the top priority, she said:“I want to reassure our communities thatwe are treating areas of the West Mainland, but not parts of the East for example, we are doing this because we are confident – based on the data – that the roads in the East do not require it.”There are km of priority one roads in Orkney, km of priority two routes and km of priority three roads.In line with nationally recommended guidance, the council’s Winter Service Policy - points out that the network will be treated in the morning when road surface temperatures are predicted to be below C, and in the afternoon when they are predicted to be below C.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney. Casey Construction Ltd. was awarded the contract to carry out the essential maintenance work and improvements.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We have always said we will act swtly should new data require it, he told broadcasters.ldquoOver recent days we have learned of a signicant number of growing cases linked to travel with Nigeria.ldquoThere are  cases already in England and thatrsquos growing. Nigeria now is second only to South Africa in terms of linked cases to Omicron.The Department of Health and Social Carelater said the correct figure was .The Scottish and Welsh governments said they were both adopting similar controls.Under the new rules, from am on Monday only British and Irish nationals travelling from Nigeria will be allowed into the country and must isolate in a government-managed quarantine hotel.And from am on Tuesday, anyone travelling to the UK from countries not on the red list will be required to take a pre-departure test a maximum of  hours before leaving, regardless of their vaccination.And ndash from am Tuesday, anyone travelling to the UK from countries not on the Red List will be required to take a pre-departure test, regardless of their vaccination status.  mdash Sajid JavidDecember , The announcement will be seen as evidence of the mounting concern within Whitehall of the threat posed by the Omicron iant.However, the requirement for pre-departure tests was greeted with anger and dismay across the travel sector ndash just as bookings were picking up with the approach of the Christmas break.Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, said the rapidly changing measures meant planning for travel was becoming impossible.ldquoIt is premature to hit millions of passengers and industry before we see the full data.

Last night was the first night.”“I went down on Monday and there was no mention of it. You used to get a  per cent discount.”He added: “I was totally surprised. I only booked my ticket a week or so ago. I wasn’t advised, and it doesn’t seem astheir crew was advised – I did query it with them.”Serco NorthLink’s commercial director Jim Dow said: “We are proud to offer an extensive food and drink menu on board that is very reasonably priced and equal for all passengers.“Our commitment to working with local suppliers continues and we are proud to showcase those partnerships. “While the Islander discount code is no longer in place, all passengers do have access to a iety of choices and price points.”A classic example of where profits are more important than the service Serco gives.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4285900.jpg--.jpg?1638548013000\n","title":"ballymena soprano catrina launches classical celtic christmas album","story":"BALLYMENA Soprano, Catrina Scullion, is launching her new album, “Classical Celtic Christmas”, in St Marys Church, Haddington Road, Dublin, tonight at pm.For those who cannot attend, the event will be broadcast virtually from the church.To watch this event please visit https:www.stmaryshaddingtonroad.ie Popular songs will include O Holy Night and Silent Night.Catrinas CD will be available in the Repository at All Saints Church, Ballymena, for pound, with proceeds being donated to St Vincent DePaul.It is hoped the local community in Ballymena will tune in and support Catrina.The Ballymenachatted to Catrina this week.

Led by Linzi McGaughey and Clare Caulfield, the group reached far and wide across the borough to ask for materials and sewers who could turn the materials into scrubs.“Such was the scale of the operation, and the scale of the generosity of local people, that soon teams of people had to be drafted in to help source, sort and allocate materials to the sewers. Sewing machines were dusted off, and a real dference was made to our frontline healthcare system.“Local businesses and communities got behind the group with fundraising, and the demand for their scrubs just kept growing. Up to  hours a day was spent taking orders directly from the hospitals, doctors, nurses, community workers, and care homes. We are all indebted to this group of amazing people, and it was wonderful to be able to view their latest creation in quilt form as a testament to all of their hard work and dedication.”Health Minister Robin Swann added: “The pandemic will be etched in our memories as one of the most challenging, anxious and indeed sad periods in our history but for me it will also be a time when we saw humanity at its very best. Despite adversity, we witnessed teams of volunteers, like NI Scrubs, step forward and achieve so much.“You should all be very proud of the contribution you made and you have my sincere appreciation for your efforts. There is no doubt that Covid has been a hugely challenging time for everyone and this is particularly true for those working in our health and social care services. The tapestry is a very fitting tribute to all the staff who worked tirelessly and courageously for us throughout the pandemic.“I want to again place on record my thanks to every single one of our health and social care workers for everything they do, every day.”Accepting the tapestry on behalf of Northern Health and Social Care Trust, Chairman Bob McCann, said: “I would like to thank the NI Scrubs volunteers for this very poignant and reflective piece of art, which in years to come will be a very important reminder of how far we all came in the fight against COVID-.“The pandemic has clearly had a signicant and sustained impact on all aspects of our health service and our staff have faced many challenges over the course of the last  months. I know that staff were very appreciative of initiatives such as that of NI Scrubs and the generosity and kindness shown to staff buoyed them during some of the darkest days.”Clare Caulfield from NI Scrubs said the tapestry was “a wonderful legacy” to all those who played their part.She added: “At the time we asked all our volunteers to give us a piece of material with their initials on it. We asked them to send the pieces in but we didnt tell them what we were going to do with them. “We had them made into a large tapestry, a wonderful legacy to everyone involved.” Clare continued: “The huge effort of every volunteer will be talked about for generations. It is mine and Linzi’s honour to have played a small part in this incredible team of amazing iniduals who stepped up when our country needed kindness, support and community the most.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4283615.jpg--.jpg?1638527740000\n","title":"demand high for booster jabs says trust","story":"The Seven Towers Mass Vaccination Centre is open for booster jabs for those aged over  group as per Department of Health guidance.

Deliveries will start from Monday, December .The NIO is also offering the book to all Sure Start centres and libraries in Northern Ireland.The book has been created to sensitively reflect on the experience of growing up in Northern Ireland, drawing on cultural touchpoints, landmarks and traditions that will resonate with children everywhere, irrespective of their background.It is an inclusive story about the experience of growing up here, and subtly touches on the ideas of resolving conflict and promoting understanding and tolerance.An NIO spokesperson said: “We would stress this is not a factual or political book, nor does the story touch on the Centenary or have a historical narrative, either directly or indirectly.”Most ReadComber apartment in property once owned by designer of the Titanic on the market for £kTributes paid to schoolgirlwho died suddenlyConor McGregor calls on Republic of Ireland to leave EU after Covid restrictions are tightenedSam McBrideOpinionSome politicians have used media as an ATM for secret, easy cash for yearsHundreds protest against vaccine certication regulationsTop VideosPlayVaccine passport protest takes place in BelfastPlayVideo: CCTV Footage shows man engulfed in getaway car fireball after Dublin shootingPlayMcGurk#s th Anniversary commemoration at the site of the blast on North Queen Street.Latest Northern IrelandLuke McNicholas hailed for ‘ridiculous’ saves to help Cltonville edge past Ballymena UnitedGlentoran ‘urgency’ enough to take advantage of Portadown ‘gts’ with comeback winCrusaders demand answers over Robbie Weir red card as Glenavon claim late win at Mourneview ParkLarne ‘back to what we’re good at’ to see off Warrenpoint Town at Inver ParkFamilies mark th anniversary of McGurk’s Bar atrocityLatestTravel industry fury as Covid pre-departure tests William reveals Tina Turner hit brings back memories of mother DianaWilliam still moved by traumatic moment from his air ambulance daysBoris Johnson expected to launch inquiry into Arthur Labinjo-Hughes murderLuke McNicholas hailed for ‘ridiculous’ saves to help Cltonville edge past Ballymena United,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Today it’s a familiar and trusted brand with a loyal fan base. But don’t think any of that came easily.Shortly before they married in , David and Fiona went on a wine tour in France, made some valuable contacts, and mulled over the idea of their own drinks business as they planned a future together. “In an ideal world we’d have started our own vineyard,” admits David. “But hey, we live in Co Down.”So instead they turned to gin. At the time, craft gin just wasn’t on the radar at all here. No one  was making it and the vast majority of drinkers had a limited choice of Gordon’s or maybe Cork Dry or Gilbey’s. In these days of bars with eye-popping gin menus stretching to hundreds of brands, it’s hard to appreciate just how audacious the Boyd-Armstrongs’ decision was.David and Fiona spent every weekend and every holiday doing research and visiting distilleries across the globe from Seattle to Seoul. They found inspiration in the legion of micro-producers dotted across America and took heart from the buying policy of one of the bigger bars in Seattle, which stocked nothing but small-scale, locally-produced drinks.The couple ordered their first still in , installed it at Rademon — the Crossgar estate owned by Fiona’s family — and spent the summer and autumn of that year developing and fine-tuning their recipe. They wanted to do everything themselves. “There was no bottling plant available to us so we had to learn how to bottle,” says Fiona. “We had to become experts in every part of the process.”After the launch in , they found they still had another part of the process to learn. Producing a new gin was only half the battle — the other half was trying to convince gin drinkers to forego their Gordon’s or their Cork Dry and try Shortcross instead. “It was like climbing a mountain,” Fiona confesses.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Introducing anything new is always going to be challenging — for example, it took us three years to get Shortcross into airport shops,” she says. “Really it’s all about changing perceptions. We found that people get more interested in your gin when you break it down for them and explain the components and how they come together.”It took years of hard work and resolve to make Shortcross the success it is today. With a larger still, a team of around  people and an expanding range that includes a cask-aged gin and the highly successful Rosie’s Garden pink gin, it must have been tempting for the Boyd-Armstrongs just to keep on doing what they’re doing.But all the time, in the background, there was another project that fascinated them.Just a couple of years after the first gin was launched, David and Fiona began distilling whiskey. And just like in the gin process, they wanted to do everything themselves. David had grown up in east Belfast, in the shadow of buildings that once housed the famous old whiskey distilleries of Avoniel and Connswater, and long before they starting making whiskey themselves, Fiona had become fascinated by the story of Ulster’s lost distilleries, so perhaps the seed of an idea had been quietly germinating for many years before it finally became a reality.Once they had produced a raw spirit from malted barley on a small -litre still, they decided they wanted to do something dferent with it. Whiskey often begins its slow process of maturation in American oak barrels, sometimes ones that have previously held bourbon, and is then finished in something like old sherry casks. But the Boyd-Armstrongs opted to do things the other way round. In March  they obtained two Grand Cru Classe Bordeaux wine casks, filled them with their newly-made spirit and put them away to quietly mature.“The casks you use really have to match the spirit you distil,” says David. “There’s a degree of black magic in deciding what you want to use and theof time the whiskey spends in each one.”After the Bordeaux casks had weaved their black magic spell, the whiskey was finished in barrels made from virgin American oak. The Boyd-Armstrongs could have bottled and sold the whiskey after three years but instead let it sit for two more. “We found it just kept getting better and better,” says David. “Finishing it in the American oak casks brought a sweetness and a nuttiness to it.”The finished whiskey finally made it into slightly fewer than  bottles just last month and when David and Fiona spoke to me they were still waiting for the labels to arrive.“In commercial terms it’s one of the smallest batches of whiskey you’ll find anywhere,” says David. But he also proudly points out it’s the first new whiskey to be wholly produced by a Northern Ireland distillery outside of Old Bushmills since the s.Just like their gin, Shortcross whiskey is a product made entirely on site to unique specications and then launched into a market where there are big players galore. It seems David and Fiona wouldn’t have it any other way.You can pre-order a bottle of Shortcross whiskey online at www.rademonestatedistilleryRead MoreGary Law:OpinionCrack open a bottle of Northern Ireland wine… all the way from New ZealandGary Law:OpinionHow a unique gin process was reborn thanks to a scrap of paper hidden in the back of a mirrorMost ReadComber apartment in property once owned by designer of the Titanic on the market for £kTributes paid to schoolgirlwho died suddenlyConor McGregor calls on Republic of Ireland to leave EU after Covid restrictions are tightenedSam McBrideOpinionSome politicians have used media as an ATM for secret, easy cash for yearsHundreds protest against vaccine certication regulationsTop VideosPlayVaccine passport protest takes place in BelfastPlayVideo: CCTV Footage shows man engulfed in getaway car fireball after Dublin shootingPlayMcGurk#s th Anniversary commemoration at the site of the blast on North Queen Street.Latest Northern IrelandLuke McNicholas hailed for ‘ridiculous’ saves to help Cltonville edge past Ballymena UnitedGlentoran ‘urgency’ enough to take advantage of Portadown ‘gts’ with comeback winCrusaders demand answers over Robbie Weir red card as Glenavon claim late win at Mourneview ParkLarne ‘back to what we’re good at’ to see off Warrenpoint Town at Inver ParkFamilies mark th anniversary of McGurk’s Bar atrocityLatestTravel industry fury as Covid pre-departure tests William reveals Tina Turner hit brings back memories of mother DianaWilliam still moved by traumatic moment from his air ambulance daysBoris Johnson expected to launch inquiry into Arthur Labinjo-Hughes murderLuke McNicholas hailed for ‘ridiculous’ saves to help Cltonville edge past Ballymena United,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I want to congratulate him, and Id also like to say a massive thank you to Travel Solutions for their generosity and kindness in supplying this prize and, in turn, supporting Foyle Down Syndrome Trust. We raised a lot of money for this very worthwhile cause. Over the last two years I know there are many people who have missed the chance to get away on a nice holiday, so thanks again to Travel Solutions for their support and I hope that Michael enjoys his sunny stay in The Algarve next summer. Julie Magill, Operations Director at Travel Solutions, said: We would like to thank the Mayor for allowing us the opportunity to support his fund raising activities for the Foyle Down Syndrome Trust. We are proud to be part of this great night.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies.

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  One hundred years ago this week, the Anglo-Irish Treaty to determine the future of Ireland and its relationship with the United Kingdom was signed at Downing Street after tense negotiation. The final outcome would have profound consequences for the city of Derry who would find itself relegated to border town status once the creation of the Northern Irish state loyal to the UK had been established. The Irish negotiators in London were Arthur Grfiths, Michael Collins, Robert Barton, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy. On the British side was David Lloyd George, Lord Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Sir Gordon Hewart and Sir Hamar Greenwood. What followed was the creation of the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. The British would also retain use of three ports – Berehaven and Spike Island in the south and Lough Swilly in Co. Donegal. A common assumption was this Treaty resulted in the partition of Ireland with six counties being formed as Northern Ireland and would remain part of the United Kingdom. However, partition had already been put into place on paper with the Government of Ireland Act in  with it taking effect on May , . All the Anglo-Irish Treaty did was give the devolved, and predominantly unionist government of Northern Ireland the option to opt out of being part of the new Irish Free State – which they duly exercised. But partition was not an idea born out of a hurried idea to provide a compromised or botched solution to the Irish Question. As Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University reveals, the seeds of it had been sown long before Michael Collins sat down to negotiate with Lloyd George. He said: “One hundred years ago, the issue of partition was on everyones minds in Derry and the North West. “It was first mentioned in the nineteenth century as a solution to, what was called at the time, The Irish Question – the idea that Ireland would be self-governing. “Obviously there was major opposition to that in Ulster from the unionist population. So the idea that partition may be a solution with Ulster being under Westminsters control while the rest of Ireland would be under a Dublin government really began to have an affect on Derry in the early part of the twentieth century. “Especially around the years  and  when Ulster unionism began to mobilise physically in terms of protests, the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Forceand the signing of the Ulster Covenant. “That really had a major impact on the North West – and Derry in particular. There was an eleven-year period then from  to  where partition was in the position that kind of like Brexit is today in that in the last five years or so it was the only thing that people were thinking about. “It did have an acute effect on Derry – particularly around  and , Derry was the centre of attention for the partition question because it was seen as the place most likely to see violence emerge as a result of those political discussions. “But of course everything changed following the outbreak of the First World War. After the war, isions became even more entrenched and violence became a reality instead of just a prospect.” While the British Government continued to hesitate over Home Rule for Ireland, Republican volunteers took matters into their own hands in  by launching the Easter Rising. Ultimately, this attempt to win independence from the British failed and the rebellion was crushed. However, the question of self-determination did not end with the execution of the risings leaders and a growing political force by the name of Sinn Feacutein more than made its mark with a stunning performance at the  General Election. The party went from only having six seats to  – including the constituency of Derry City. Dr Grant added: “The thing about the Derry parliamentary seat is that it was a swing seat – a bit like today with the Fermanagh and South Tyrone Westminster seat. “The Derry City seat was so contentious because most men had a vote in parliamentary elections but not in local elections – an issue that remained controversial right up to the early s. “With the parliamentary vote, nationalists and unionists were evenly split in terms of the voting rights in the city. So election results tended to go unionist-nationalist-unionist-nationalist throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century. “So it wasnt a huge surprise when Sinn Feacutein won it in . But at the same time, it was always very close and there was huge media attention on it because it was so close. “The big thing in  was that the Irish Parliamentary Partyand Sinn Feacutein made a pact in Ulster that meant Derry was kind of pre-decided almost for Sinn Feacutein. “The IPP pulled back and gave Sinn Feacutein a free run at Derry but they would have got free runs themselves where such as West Belfast for example when Sinn Feacutein pulled out there. “Cardinal Michael Logue – who was the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland – brokered a pact between Sinn Feacutein and the IPP as they were afraid that they would knock each other out in seats like Derry and West Belfast and let the Unionists in to sweep up the seats.”  Read more: When unionists lost control of Derry Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  With Sinn Feacuteins electoral success in the Derry City seat in  General Election, nationalists turned their eyes on local government. The running of affairs within Derry had been in the control of Protestants Unionists since the days of when King James II unsuccessfully laid siege to the city in . However, the introduction of a proportional electoral system for council elections had been introduced prior to the  local government poll – the result of which was seismic for Derry. A coalition of Sinn Feacutein, the Nationalist Party and an independent Nationalist councillor, Hugh ODoherty, won control of Derry Council from the Unionists by just two seats with ODoherty himself being appointed Mayor of the city. Not surprisingly, the result caused resentment amongst the Protestant and unionist community which spiralled into the Derry riots of June . Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “The riots of  in the city are interesting in that while partition had been on peoples minds, serious violence had not occurred in the city since  .   “The  election was signicant in that it was a landslide for Sinn Feacutein and the whole country changed politically. So there was a fear on the part of unionists of an independent Ireland. “But to my mind, the most signicant thing was the  local elections in January of that year. “The unionist minority in Derry had held control of the city since the siege in . So theyve had two hundred or so years of dominance. “Because of the introduction of proportional representation, for the first time ever, the nationalists and Sinn Feacutein took control over local government after winning a combined majority of just two. “That in turn meant the Mayor of Derry, Hugh ODoherty, was both a nationalist and the first Catholic to hold that position since . So that was a hugely signicant and symbolic event because it meant that control of local government had been taken out of the hands of unionists and into those of nationalists. “That was hugely important politically because all of the conversation in ,  and into  was about would there be partition  andthat was to happen, where would the line be drawn . “If Derry Corporation was under nationalist control, then the propaganda victory and the moral argument would have tipped the balance towards the argument that Derry should be a Free State city rather than a Northern Irish one. “So unionists were very nervous and scared of their futures because of those signicant changes that took place. Weekend by weekend throughout the year, there was violence, rioting and fighting in the streets that became more and more intense. “You had events in the south with IRA attacks and counter-attacks from the Black and Tans that made things in Derry even more intense and then it all kicked off one night in June . “It spiralled from the Diamond into the Fountain area followed by a counter-attack from the Bogside and by the end of the week, there were twenty people dead – a really, really terrible week in the citys history.”  Read more: Derry the centre of attention in Partition question Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

This week marks the centenary of The Anglo-Irish Treaty that would see Derry in a precarious position in its bid to be part of the new Irish Free StateReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, This week marks the th anniversary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish Treaty. In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  The riots that took place in Derry in  eventually came to a close but tensions in the city were still on a powderkeg. While Sinn Feacutein held the Derry City Westminster constituencyand a Nationalist coalition in control of both the citys Council and the Mayors office, events where would decide the future of Derrys fortunes. Partition of the Ireland had been an idea since the nineteenth century but it became a reality late in  with the Government of Ireland Act. The bill meant that six of Irelands counties would form the state of Northern Ireland to be run by a devolved – and predominantly unionist – administration in Belfast. May  saw the enforcement of the Act and it left Derry cut off from the rest of Ireland – especially from the trade it had with neighbouring Co. Donegal. Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “Partition – on paper – took place as a result of the Government of Ireland Act in . That piece of legislation allowed for the creation of two separate parliaments of two politically jurisdictions – Northern Ireland in the six counties and Southern Ireland in the  counties. “Northern Ireland was founded with the unionist political establishment ran the legislation to establish a parliament, set up a police force and put into place the whole mechanisms of a government.  Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University  “Whereas in the south, the whole concept of there being a Southern Ireland never really took hold because it wasnt accepted by nationalists or Sinn Feacuteiners as a solution to the issue. “So essentially, the Government of Ireland Act was just ignored. The Southern Irish parliament was never founded which meant the  counties were in a state of limbo while Northern Ireland was being founded. “It was only when the Treaty negotiations took place that the concept of the Free State of Ireland came into play. “Though it had taken place on paper, actual partition didnt take place until after the Free State had been founded. “With the partition on paper, the news of that did not go down well at all with Derrys nationalist community. “I think that once that happened, it was just a matter for them to try and keep their heads down and use the power that they had gained in the local elections earlier in  to try and argue for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “There was a twin-strategy. The ultimate outcome would be a united Ireland that was independent – whether it would be a republic or not would be another point. There was a feeling that the IRA and Sinn Feacutein could achieve their aims and there would be no worries about partition and treat it asit was something to be ignored. “Others probably more realistically thought that partition was going to happen whatever the outcome was. For those nationalists and republicans, their strategy was to argue forcefully in the press and in the political circles for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “They went out mapping, interviewing people throughout the potential border area to ask their opinion on where they would like to reside and put out the message that Derry was a nationalist city and should not be included in Northern Ireland. “They also wanted to keep control of local government so they could continue to make that point.” While nationalists in Derry went about arguing their case, Michael Collins himself was planning a campaign of destabilisation to collapse the new Northern Ireland and have Derry and the North within the Free States fold. However, events close to home would prevent that. A turn that would have profound consequences on Derry for decades to come.  The second and final part of “Derry and the Anglo-Irish Treaty”, will be in next Mondays edition of The Derry News on December .

The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,. A crowdfunding page has brought in poundK so far and Ballinderry are aiming to help raise the remainder. On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I’m delighted to be here, it’s a new challenge and there’s a lot expected from us, but we’ll embrace that and enjoy it.” City boss Ruaidhri Higgins took his time deciding on his number two and feels he has now got the right man for the job. “Alan is a fantastic coach and it is important for me to have someone of his quality and experience here,” he stated. “He knows the league inside out and will have the trust of the players, which is key. He’s been here before which always helps as well, and he will bring plenty of ideas and energy to the club. “We are comfortable with where we are in our preparations for the new season and are looking forward to getting going again in the coming weeks. ”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

With  minutes played, the Maghera side trailed their Antrim counterparts by - to - and looked to be fading into the December chill. However, Thomas McKeagneys nd effort got St Pats moving again, and they had closed the gap to five points at the second half water break. When James Friels th minute free dropped straight to the net, it left just the minimum between the sides and Maghera outscored Garron Tower by - to - in the final ten minutes to take the spoils. The defeated St Killians side. The Derry men had started brightly too, and a Callum OKane brace had them - to - up after just five minutes, but a magnicent double save from Odhran McElhinney proved a warning for St Pats. Two huge frees from Joseph McLaughlin got St Killians off the mark, and after Niall McGarrell had put them ahead on  minutes, McLaughlins third gave them a - to - lead at the water break. Well in the ascendency, Garron Tower were swaggering, and hit three points in as many minutes from McLaughlin , Cormac McKeown and Niall McGarrell to extend the lead to five points. James Friel hit back with two long range frees, but a long range Padraig McKillop effort in stoppage time saw St Killians lead by - to - at the break. The Antrim side continued where they left off in the second half, another brace of McLaughlin frees and a McGarrell effort opening up a seven-point lead, but then things began to turn.  St Pats Knock out Our Ladys to reach Mageean semi final  The Maghera school will now meet St Killians, Garron Tower in the semi final.   Thomas McKeagney punched the air after hitting St Pats first second half score on  minutes, and Callum OKane wriggled free to point and leave them trailing - to - at the water break. Corner back Conor Shiels raised a roar from his team with a long-range free on  minutes to close the gap to three, before St Pats got the little bit of luck they were craving. James Friel sent in a long free, and despite several swinging hurls, the ball floated over them all and into the net. Another Shiels free levelled matters in the th minute, but the expected St Killians backlash never came, and McKeagney nudged Maghera in front on  minutes. A sublime sideline cut from Eoin Scullion doubled the lead three minutes later, before Conor Shiels third free opened a - to - gap. Only a goal would do for Garron Tower, but they watched in disappointment as Seanie McIntosh’s attempt at dropping the ball into the box floated over the bar, and Conor Shiels restored the three-point margin with a nd minute free, his fourth of the day. A satisfying comeback for the Maghera side, who will now contest a Mageean Cup final with either St Louis Ballymena or St Patricks Downpatrick, who meet at the Dub on Friday night.

Gemma Doherty and Morgana MacIntyre, Reporter: Domhnall MacDermott Dec   addthis, Fresh from winning Album of the Year at the NI Music Awards, the Derry Belfast duo Saint Sister are destined for big things. The group, made up of Derry born singer harpist Gemma Doherty, of the Delacroix Dohertys, and Belfast-born singer Morgana MacIntyre, are currently playing their first tour in almost two years. googletag.cmd.push I caught up with Gemma after their triumphant Nerve Centre debut last weekend: What’s it like playing for crowds again after a year of livestreams  “It was amazing to see creative people come together and make some really special online shows in the absence of live music. “That said, it’s hard to beat the feeling of people coming together and experiencing something live in a room. “I really missed the feedback you get from the audience and how that feeds into the performance. “It can completely dictate the energy of a show, and that’s just not something you can create with only cameras in the room. “I think we’ve been a lot less nervous chatting and engaging with the audience since everything has opened back up, and we’re a lot more aware of being in the moment since it was taken away from us for a while.” Which do you prefer  Stripped down shows or playing with the full band  “I absolutely love playing the shows with the full band, especially with the seven-piece or the -piece band that we got to play with for our album livestream back in June. It’s a dream to hear the full scale of the album arrangements behind us when we’re on stage. “But I’ve been really enjoying the run of more intimate two-piece shows that we’ve been playing over the last few weeks. “When you strip the songs right back to their core, it becomes all about the vocals and finding the journey of each song with just one instrument behind it. “ We seem to lock into a dferent kind of flow and it feels like we’re engaging with the audience on a dferent level.” What was it like opening for Keane in America before lockdown  “It was great craic. Those were some of the biggest venues we’d ever played and the crowds and venues were beautul. “The last show we played in the states was in the stunning Dolby Theatre in LA where the Oscars had been held just a few weeks before. “It was supposed to be a  date tour, but we got to play  shows on the West Coast before things started closing down and we had to come home.” What’s been the best part of touring again and why was it playing Derry  “Hearing people sing along to the tunes from the second album has been really special, and as I mentioned before, being able to feel the audience in the room again and react to their energy. Derry was a class gig, we loved it. “It’s always a bit nerve-racking playing in your hometown, the stakes feel higher. “But it was the warmest welcome we could have asked for, and the same in Morgan’s hometown Belfast the following night.” Did you make any changes to the new album after lockdown delayed it’s release  “Thankfully we had just got our final mixes back around the beginning of March , and by the time the first lockdown hit we were already getting it mastered. It would have been so tempting to go back in and tweak it endlessly with the perceived extra time that lockdown gave us. I’m grateful in a way that it was finished before all that, and that it got to stay true to itself before the world went a bit mad.” How did it feel to win the NI Music Award’s Album of the Year   “Thank you! There were so many great albums out this year so we were genuinely shocked when it was announced. We missed the ceremony in the Ulster Hall unfortunately as we had a show in Waterford that night but we came off stage and looked at our phones and got a lovely surprise! And we got to celebrate properly a few nights later with the hometown shows in Derry and Belfast.” Other Voices is  this year. Want to share some memories of it from over the years  “Some of our favourite experiences as a band have been with the Other Voices gang. “There Courage livestreams were so inspiring and really set the bar for what a streamed experience could be, taking hold of some of the country’s most beautul spaces and opening them up in a new way. “We did an Other Voices livestream in the Guildhall last July with the string quartet from the Crash Ensemble and I think it was one of my favourite shows of all time. “ We’ve had some of the best weekends in Dingle over the years too, playing in St James’ Church in  was a massive one. “We met Lisa Hannigan for the first time outside the church after that gig, which lead to us going on tour with her a few months later, and having her feature on our most recent album.” Saint Sister’s brilliant second album, ‘Where I Should End,’ is available in Cool Discs on Foyle Street and other good record shops.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Around , Apptentice Boys are expected to parade through Derry today.HomeApprentice Boys of Derry to stage Lundys Day commemoration in city today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too.

finalised and it is hoped that once the date of the K event and the venue have been formally confirmed that the parkrun will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, the proposed Downpatrick parkrun also has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last.Last month, the Town Committee issued an online appeal for ldquoenthusiastic and committed volunteers to come forward to help get the parkrun up and running and itrsquos hoped that the parkrun could become a weekly event and attract people from across the district to enhance their health and enjoy the great outdoors.Downpatrick area councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed the progress on establishing a parkrun event at Dunleath Park.He said parkruns have become popular with runners and walkers alike across the country and keen participants in the Downpatrick area have been planning the establishment of a similar event in the county town.Cllr Sharvin confirmed that he recently requested an update from Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities department on the progress of establishing the parkrunand providing financial support to the group setting up the event.ldquoI am happy to report that the financial contribution and approach has been agreed between all stakeholders and officers are working with the parkrun organisers to finalise the details, he said.ldquoWith this great news, it should not be long until we have our first parkrun event in Downpatrick, utilising the new trail around Dunleath.Cllr Sharvin added: ldquoA parkrun will also bring people from outside the area into Downpatrick spending locally in our shops and cafes, adding to our great array of social and leisure activities on offer.News that Dunleath Park could host the parkrun comes after recent confirmation that major investment is planned for this part of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is planning to create a series of new facilities, including a dedicated running track, while also in the pipeline are a cycling pump track, skateboarding track, improved planting and a new play park.In addition, soccer and GAA pitches are in line for an upgrade as part of the plan to transform Dunleath Park into a sporting and recreational hub.Itrsquos understood that the area earmarked for the proposed pump track, skateboard track and play park sit outside the parkrsquos floodplain and will enable the local authority to move faster in putting a

From the resulting kick-out Carew won possession before sending over a mammoth effort to put the Johnnies back in the ascendancy.With both teams displaying huge work rate, the challenge for the Johnnies was to play through the Fontenoy press and find space.Ryan Morganrsquos pace, and incisive angled runs were a crucial factor in carving a way through a Fontenoy backline that was being well marshalled by Queens Universityrsquos Niall McElroy.Cope and Madine combined to create an exceptional team score in the th minute, but the Fontenoy response was swt and the energetic Eoin OrsquoHare burst through to raise the green flag in the next phase of play.Caolan Burns and Eoin McCrickard kept the scoreboard ticking over with well taken frees for their sides.A key battle within the game was that of Johnnies centre half Oran OrsquoConnor against Michael McMullan. OrsquoConnor was readily available each time the full back line of Aaron Murphy, Adam Walsh and team captain Rory McMullan gained possession.McMullanrsquos brave block from a Shea Moorehead effort in the th minute typied the spirit within this young Johnnies team, his cousin Conor McMullan claimed the resultant rebound and found Cope who won a late free on the far sideline.From fully  yards out, Ryan Morgan launched a majestic effort that found its way to the Fontenoy net to leave just one score between the teams. The next kick-out was pivotal. Kevin Middleton managed to fist the ball down to the onrushing OrsquoToole to claim a vital possession for the Fontenoys who held out for a narrow win.A great game played in a good spirit and well officiated by referee Colm Gribben..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Planners approve Down High order  ","story":"PLANNERS have given the green light to y a condition of the planning approval for Down High Schoolrsquos new multi-million pound campus in Downpatrick.The iation ensures that archaeological remains uncovered within the proposed development site are properly identied and protected or appropriately recorded.Local planners have approved the move under their delegated authority which means their decision does not have to be formally approved by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.The Education Authority confirmed recently that an application was made to allow construction of the eagerly-awaited new school to start, in tandem with the completion of the archaeological works which, due to the signicant findings uncovered, could take some time.A spokesman confirmed that site works are due to finish next January, with the archaeological report expected to take a further six months or more to complete.Education officials have also revealed that an addendum to the original business case was completed and approved in March this year.They say the new school project was issued for tender last month with a target of contract award by the second quarter of ldquoto complete a -month contract period for construction of the new school building and associated works.It also emerged recently that the contract to build Down High School on a site mdash which borders the Strangford and Quoile roads mdash could be awarded as early as next spring.Tenders were issued last month and education officials expect that it will take  months to build the eagerly-anticipated new building and complete all associated site works once construction work gets underway.The site was purchased some time ago by the Department of Education with the construction of the new school deemed a priority as far back as  due to what at the time was described as the existing schoolrsquos ldquosubstandard accommodation and over-reliance on temporary classrooms.The site of the proposed new campus is located in an area of outstanding natural beauty which also includes a graveyard linked to the townrsquos former workhouse.Extensive archaeological work was disrupted by the coronavirus but has resumed to identy and evaluate any remains at the site.It is understood that any which are discovered will be relocated to a nearby site during an ecumenical service led by local clergy.School officials say they are aware of the ldquohistoric signicance of the development site, with plans to commemorate important parts of local history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Posthumous honour for ‘hero’ fundraiser Bonny after £230k Marie Curie support  ","story":"A DRUMANESS man who helped raise pound, to support families deal with terminal illness has been posthumously honoured by Marie Curie.The late BonnyBrown was one of a number of people given an honorary remembrance award at the charityrsquos annual Fundraising Excellence Awards.His family watched online last week as Marie Curie chief executive Matthew Reed paid tribute to the  year-old who started the Co Down Marie Curie fundraising group.He said: ldquoWe are here to celebrate people in their letime who gave so much time and of themselves and made such a considerable dference to the work of Marie Curie and to so many dferent families.Bonny sadly died on April  last year of a heart attack which shocked and saddened the Drumaness community.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13268428.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Top left is the M towards Antrim, top right M bridge to Bangor, and bottom is WestlinkIt was written by the roads expert Wesley Johnston . The online version of this article will link to it.Wesley is an astute analyst of roads infrastructure, and he runs a website devoted to Northern Ireland’s highways - both those that have been built in recent years, those that are being built, and those that are planned.My heart sank when I read Wesley’s analsysis of the proposals to join three of NI’s busiest routes - the M, the Westlink M, and the M bridge - in a seamless interchange that will remove all traffic lights and all obstacles.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.He concluded that the scheme was now unlikely to proceed in its current form.I have had concerns about this vital project for many years, given the delays and reviews.Only last month a Belfast City Council committee voted to withdraw its support from the plans.Stormont’s infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon of the SDLP, has seemed, as Wesley put it, “lukewarm about York Street Interchange from the outset”.One of her predecessors, Sinn Fein’s Chris Hazzard, wanted to emphasise projects west of the Bann, such as the A.It seems that some politicians in the Alliance Party have turned against the York Street plan too.There are a number of reasons for the new coolness towards the interchange, including the growing interest in environmental matters and the changes to lestyle and travel patterns caused by Cocid.I wonderin some quarters there is an extra layer of hostility to the £ million project because the DUP secured funding for it as part of its agreement to sustain the Conservative Party in power in . This would be a disappointing outlookso, because the DUP was rightly praised for seeking financial support that would benefit the whole community, rather than just unionists, when it struck a deal with Theresa May after the general election of that year.There are some dubious ideas that are emerging now about road projects.The first is that it is automatically a good thing to constrain vehicle traffic in order to make way for cyclists and pedestrians and buses.It is indeed a good idea to do that in many contexts, particularly in urban areas. But often such changes help people who are young and able bodied and who live in densely populated areas.They do not help, say, a single mother in the suburbs who has to take her children to school in one direction in the rain, then travel in the other to a job in which it is not possible to work from home.It does not help an elderly person who lives in a rural area who depends on a car for their mobility and whose home is located in such a sparsely populated location that there is no prospect, ever of regular public transport services.In other words, it is not necessarily a selfish thing to want to run a car, as some of the more hardcore environmental scolds imply.In fact cars are one of the greatest advances in human history and have enabled people around the world to live much more liberated lives than they did only decades ago, when poorer people were unable to afford to travel far from their home.Covid has caused changes in lestyle pattern changes that should be welcomed, such as the increased flexibility caused by many people working from home. This will reduce rush hour congestion and will enable people to live far further from their work places and so should lead to a more even spread in property prices between town and country.Yet we have also seen that the desire that people have to use their car has — inevitably — come roaring back. Therefore we need to focus on making cars more environmentally efficient, and to make roads better too.The first part of that equation was happening anyway. When I was born in the US in the s, cars were grossly inefficient because petrol was so cheap. Now cars get two or three times more miles to the gallon than they did. Electric cars and other innovations will make this even better.But good, freeflowing trunk roads are an environmental boost too.In fact they can go in tandem with restrictions to traffic in towns and cities.I think we need more mph limits in urban areas, perhaps enforced by speed cameras, but more so-called expresswayswith mph limits to get between towns.The York St junction is a key example of this. We do not want traffic that is going from Stormont to West Belfast to crawl through city streets. We want it to travel on a ring road so that we can make those city streets more friendly to local and slower traffic.Not only should York St be built, we should be planing a free flowing junction at Tillysburn too and indeed a freer flowing outer ring road, ideally all the way round past Forestside and out towards the M near Lisburn, where traffic can then rejoin the ‘ring road’ back towards Belfast and the Westlink.Ms Mallon’s review of York Street which was completed this year recommended that the project think more broadly about its impacts on the local area. But the immediate vicinity of the road has been a noisy, congested junction for decades and will never cease to be so. The interchange would have made it easier to cross from the city centre to north Belfast by foot or bicycle by separating such traffic from the junction.As to the A, it too should be built, because such roads are far safer than single carriageways. Another ‘environmental’ argument for major roads.Northern IrelandNichola MallonBen LowryWestlinkDUP  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularJim Wells and Sammy Wilson in tension with DUP over election and CovidWill it be a white Christmas in   Northern Ireland Met Office snow forecast and odds, and when was the last oneBook extract: London is the cultural capital for the Irish, but that didn’t dim anti-British feeling back home over BrexitDUP MP Sammy Wilson: I have no apology to make for ‘Covid joke tweet’Coleraine tragedy: ‘Remarkable story of true friendship between Nigel McGraw and Russell McAfee shows us how to treat each other’Most Popular best men’s waterproof hiking trousers UK: stay dry hiking with trousers from Craghoppers, Berghaus, MontaneChristmas decorations : ornaments for your home from Gisela Graham and Lidl, and best fairy lightsFood and drink gts: best Christmas food and drink hampers from Marks and Spencer, Aldi and Hotel ChocolatWhite Company Cyber Monday : How to get  percent off everything during the brand’s ‘White Weekend’The best Cyber Monday bargains for toys, including Disney, Lego, Harry Potter, Paw Patrol                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

As well as endorsing previous Official Unionist Party policies since the foundation of the Northern Ireland state of locking up swings and closing down playgrounds on Sundays the DUP earned an even harder line reputation for trying to shut down anything it regarded as unchristian or anti-Biblical.In the s party stalwarts picketed cinemas showing Monty Python’s ‘Le of Brian’ or ‘The Exorcist’ and even protested over the first sex shops that opened in Northern Ireland during the early s. At one memorable and unintentionally hilarious demonstration outside a sex shop in East Belfast DUP activists held up placards calling on motorists to “bump your horn for decency.” As late as  the DUP used its influence on Newtonabbey Borough Council to have a play, ‘The Bible: The Complete Word of God ’ pulled from the schedule of ‘The Theatre at The Mill’. Evangelicals claimed it supposedly mocked the Bible.It is therefore a sign of how the Covid- pandemic has turned our world upside down that at present it is the DUP who is the party of fun and the defender of decadent delights while the rest of the political forces in the power sharing executive appear more like the modern day Puritans. He may not thank for me saying this but objectively the DUP Economy Minister Gordon Lyons is currently the publican’s best friend at Stormont.After Health Minister Robin Swann suggested last month that another lockdown might be necessary to curb the next mass outbreak of Covid infections in Northern Ireland Lyons came out firmly against any new socio-economic shutdown.The Economy Minister warned that the prospect of a Christmas lockdown would have a “horrendous impact” on businesses particularly in the hospitality sector. In an interview for ‘Ulster Business’ recently Lyons said a Christmas ‘circuit breaker’ “would really be a backward step” for the economy. How pub, café and restaurant owners must have cheered when they read those words!The minister’s defence of this vital, enterprising and tax revenue-raising sector of the economy should not be conflated with the anti-vax, social-distance sceptics out there who inhabit a weird, paranoid closed universe of conspiracy theories and unscientic irrationality. Protecting businesses and jobs should go hand in hand with protecting people’s health the two are not mutually exclusive.It is none the less a pity that some of his party colleagues most notably Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley seem to be sending out mixed messages about public health such as the necessity to wear face masks and the vaccination of  to -year olds.Gordon Lyons is right to stand up for the hard-hit bar owners and restaurateurs whose businesses were devastated during the albeit very necessary -month shut down. Yet these enterprises were only able to re-open againthanks largely to the UK’s hugely successful vaccination programme. It is justied that the minister champions the local hospitality industry in their opposition to yet another damaging and costly lockdown especially one which will probably not get any ‘cushion’ financing from the UK Treasury this time around.At the bar in my ‘local’ the proprietor John Bittles has left an unambiguous Christmas message for regulars and first-time visitors alike. Underneath the words, “Seasons Greetings” punters are advised: “No Jab, No Juice.” It is an exhortation that most of Bittles’ bar’s regular clients will adhere to once it becomes compulsory to produce proof of vaccination when we enter the pub.There is however a glaring contradiction in the policy of ‘No Jab, No Juice’ brought in by the Northern Ireland Executive for this festive month. After December th a customer can walk into any city centre bar for a lunchtime drink butthey have refused to be vaccinated then they will be shown the door. Several hours later that same person can walk up the Grosvenor or Lisburn Roads to go and work in the Royal or Belfast City Hospitals in whatever capacity and they will not have to produce proof of vaccination for Covid-.At the time of writing Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK where there are no mandatory vaccinations within the care home sector and the NHS. It is this policy rather than any silly posturing gestures over the ‘right’ not to wear a face mask that the DUP and its MPs should be questioning over the next few weeks and months.• Other comment pieces below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter• Henry McDonald Nov : Brexit might be why Bertie Ahern has joined the unionist bashing• Ben Lowry Dec : It is a great pity to see York St road plan in Belfast slipping away• Canon Ian Ellis Dec : Church leaders call for an end to the violence in Colombia• Dr Paul Kingsley Dec : Magee has courses not on offer where yet Protestants are under-represented• Robbie Butler Dec : Any amnesty will overwhelmingly benefit ex terrorists• Ruth Dudley Edwards Nov : It is superficial to blame religion for the NI Troubles• Owen Polley Nov : Windsor Park  NI-Republic football match was case study in nationalist myth making• David Trimble Nov : I feel betrayed by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which rips out the heart of the  Belfast Agreement• Book Review: Unionist leaders should read this vital defence of NI’s place in UK• Writers Oct : We probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book which defends the Union——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon will benefit from greenway works in Dromore and secure cycle parking, bike repair stands and cycle counters.Mrs Kelly said: “The announcement of an additional £m funding from SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon will benefit projects and people locally and across the North. Since becoming a minister, Nichola Mallon has made greenway and active travel projects a key priority for her and it’s great to see this delivery building on the success of other projects in this area. “In Upper Bann, cycle parking facilities and its usage have been generally very low but a large proportion are located on private land for customer use. However, the potential cycle parking solutions considered by Council offers a higher level of cycle parking given the visibility and security of the locations, followed by off street car parks, parks and then within the existing footways of the town centre. “The fact that SDLP Minister Mallon received more applications for funding than anticipated demonstrates the popularity of these projects and schemes across the North.“ The coronavirus pandemic highlighted the importance of having local greenways and outdoor spaces that people can enjoy and this funding commitment from the Minister will improve the lives of communities across the North. “The SDLP is determined to deliver the projects that matter to local people and I’m delighted to see SDLP Minister Mallon continue in this vein.” New hospital for Craigavon in limbo as Departments of Health and Finance wrangle over costEditor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.
