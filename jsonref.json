Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

How might their work contribute at a turning point in history when the choices we make will so significantly affect the kinds of lives we live tomorrow? Perhaps the answer to these questions is no more than a continuation of the primary duty of any writer – to write as well as possible.But what if that isn’t enough? What if a writer also wants to illuminate the fault lines of the moment, characterise an injustice or humanise an issue burning within them? Then the challenge becomes more complex and, I’d say, considerably more demanding. To give literary shape to the climate crisis, sexism, racism, inclusivity, yet still make good art. To avoid didacticism or polemic and create a poem or story that carries us effortlessly – through craft, imagination and empathy – into the beating human heart of a matter. With all this in mind, I was delighted to be asked by the National Centre for Writing and the British Council to showcase 10 UK writers who are asking the questions that will shape our future. They are Martin MacInnes, Hannah Lavery, Elizabeth Jane-Burnett, Laura Bates, Nikita Lalwani, Alys Conran, Raymond Antrobus, Clare Pollard, Adam Weymouth and Garrett Carr.All the writers on this list have, in a variety of ways, met that challenging criterion with brilliance and verve, in forms that range from travelogues to poems, memoir to young adult fiction. What they share is an ability to see clearly into the connective tissue of their subjects, to create narratives that join the dots, that follow threads of consequence and causality through the fabric of society.Forster’s “only connect”, then. Well, yes, and maybe that’s another way of describing these writers, as 10 of the most inspirational “literary connectors” at work in the UK. But for me it’s what they do with those connections that marks them out as voices to which we should pay special attention. In 2016 I wrote a film-poem about the founding of the NHS, To Provide All People. As part of my research, I read Aneurin Bevan’s seminal collection of essays, In Place of Fear – a book that came to mind again as I read the work of these 10 writers. Because that is the other thing the questions they ask offer us: an alternative response to so many of our contemporary fears about the future, from the climate emergency and immigration to motherhood, technology and nationalism. Bevan’s essays also asked a question of his time, one that was perhaps made most manifest in the creation of the NHS: “Who do we want to be?” Ultimately, that is also what the work of these writers is asking now. Who do we want to be? What kind of a humanity do we want our children to inherit? How we answer – as iniduals, nations, a species – will shape our future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afb4c3dd8c2f9a58b5ed326e53d6a7e3d3b9909d/0_314_4747_2846/master/4747.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c1d2b4bc125ab36b8ffe68671d7e0316","title":"eid lockdown ramadan","story":"The end of Ramadan is a time to be with family. So this year we will congregate online – a luxury older generations never hadAs we approach the end of Ramadan, the Eid al-Fitr celebrations will be taking place this weekend. Yet Eid is going to look and feel very different this year. That for British Muslims it’s taking place in lockdown, through a global pandemic, is painful and heartbreaking.Eid al-Fitr follows weeks of fasting and marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. It is full of rituals and traditions that involve the entire family: we put on new clothes and attend prayers, followed by a rich breakfast of roasted vermicelli (sawaiyan), sweet halwa and channa curry. The feast continues with an elaborate lunch, at least it does in our household: my mother is not happy until there is chicken biryani, haleem, fried fish, lamb chops and kebabs.But, I reminisce: this is the experience I’ve had until now, where parents, siblings, in-laws, nieces and nephews all meet, kiss, hug and wish each other eid mubarak. So far it has never crossed my mind to celebrate Eid without immediate family.Despite having left home more than two decades ago and living in a different city, I always make it home for Eid. I was once based abroad, more than 4,000 miles away, but I took a seven-hour flight to Heathrow, spent two hours on the train and a short ferry trip so I could be home. The shock and delight on my family’s faces as I arrived unannounced is something I still remember over a decade later. Having to celebrate Eid on my own this year? I guess there is a first time for everything.The current situation demands that we protect our loved ones by staying away. In England, people of black Caribbean background are most at risk, with 78 deaths per 100,000, while those of Indian or Pakistani origin have between 30-35 deaths per 100,000. It’s a frightening number but we should take comfort in the fact that these are extenuating circumstance that perhaps will not be repeated again in our lifetime. Perhaps the best way to accept the situation is to look to the past. I recall my grandmother saying how hard it was for her and the family not to see her son – my dad – for more than nine years after he left Pakistan to come and study in England in the late 1960s. It now feels sad to think that he was all alone, spending all those Eids so far from his family. I have never before understood the true hardship and loneliness of his time, when it took nearly a month to send and receive letters.Many ethnic minorities have lost loved ones to the pandemic or are in isolation due to health issues, and for Muslims, being unable to come together as a family will be painful and hard. Not being able to console each other, hold hands, hug or simply sit next to each other seems cruel. We must adapt and support our families and communities in new ways. For this one year we will have to make do with Eid gatherings on Zoom and House Party. But let us be grateful for the technology that makes it possible to see and talk to our loved ones at the touch of a button."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6e4da264bf1e583aefe2d1e0799d16f608f4007/1286_604_2241_1345/master/2241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c404ba6bdfe8be04b86564df7d7e10d2","title":"how the plandemic conspiracy theory took hold","story":"In just a few days, the bogus Covid-19 claims of a discredited research scientist spread to millions via YouTube, Facebook and other video-sharing sitesTo have one viral sensation, Oscar Wilde might have said, is unfortunate. But to have two smacks of carelessness. And that’s what we have. The first is Covid-19, about which much printer’s ink has already been spilled. The second is Plandemic, a 26-minute “documentary” video featuring Dr Judy Mikovits, a former research scientist and inveterate conspiracy theorist who blames the coronavirus outbreak on big pharma, Bill Gates and the World Health Organization. She also claims that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which is headed by Dr Anthony Fauci) buried her research showing vaccines weaken people’s immune systems and made them more vulnerable to Covid-19. Just to round off the accusations, Mikovits claims that wearing masks is dangerous because it “literally activates your own virus”. And, if proof were needed that the pharma-Gates-scientific-elite cabal were out to get her, the leading journal Science in 2011 retracted a paper by her on a supposed link between a retrovirus and chronic fatigue syndrome that it had accepted in 2009.The video went online on 4 May when its maker, Mikki Willis, a hitherto little-known film producer, posted it to Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and a separate website set up to share the video. For three days it built up a head of steam on Facebook pages dedicated to conspiracy theories, many of which linked to the video on YouTube. By 11 May it had been viewed more than 8m times on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and had generated countless other posts on websites and social media. Later that day YouTube, Vimeo and Facebook took down the video, and in theory it disappeared from the internet – only of course it hadn’t, in the time-honoured way of subversive material in the networked world. The cognitive pathogen had escaped into the wild and was spreading virally.As it did so, a number of journalists and network scientists began to map the route by which this niche obsession made it into the big time. A New York Times team traced it back to a Facebook page dedicated to QAnon, a rightwing conspiracy theory, which has 25,000 members, headed with the clickbait injunction “Exclusive Content, Must Watch”. The video went from being viewed directly on YouTube to people linking out to it on Facebook, Twitter and other social media channels, with each link increasing the possibility that it would make the next big jump.On the afternoon of 5 May, the link was shared by a celebrity medic who had appeared on Oprah and had half a million followers on Facebook. Later that evening Plandemic popped up on a large-scale political page on Facebook. The page, reports the NYT, “was for Reopen Alabama, which has over 36,000 members and was part of the movement by Americans who wanted to lift shelter-in-place orders. Once the video appeared on that page, which was linked to dozens of other Reopen America groups, it quickly began spreading to the pages of those other groups in a kind of forceful multiplier effect.”The next day it was shared by a Republican politician in Ohio with her 20,000 Facebook followers. “If you watch ANYTHING on my page,” she wrote, “it needs to be this.” This then brought the video into the Republican mainstream, which meant that it was everywhere in semi-polite rightwing society.The NYT reconstruction of Plandemic’s meteoric rise was complemented by the different approach taken by Erin Gallagher, a social media analyst who used analytical and graphical tools often used by data scientists. She looked for public Facebook posts containing the keywords “Plandemic” or “Judy Mikovits” and then started to draw the network graphs that emerged from those data sets.The most interesting thing about the resulting social media networks is the centrality of certain conspiracist Facebook pages and groups and YouTube channels in them. For example, QAnon looms large and central. So do Collective Action Against Bill Gates, ChemtrailsGlobalSkywatch, Fall of the Cabal, Truth Revolution, and even our old friend David Icke and his YouTube channel.All of which suggests that when a Covid-19 vaccine does eventually arrive, conspiracy theorists will have a field day.

On 31 March, Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, 13, from Brixton, south London, died in the early hours of the morning at King’s College Hospital after testing positive for coronavirus. According to a family friend, his mother and siblings could not be at his bedside and, after some of his siblings also developed symptoms, his immediate family had to miss his funeral as they were required to self-isolate. It is impossible to comprehend the scale of their pain.On the same day that Ismail died, officers from Durham constabulary made contact with a member of Dominic Cummings’s family in Durham about reports that the prime minister’s most senior adviser had been seen by a witness on their property, despite being in London a few days previously. We now know from revelations in the  that Cummings and his family travelled 260 miles to Durham after his partner developed coronavirus symptoms. Yesterday, Downing Street issued an official statement that Cummings and his family went there after his partner developed Covid-19 symptoms, in case he also fell ill and needed help with childcare, but that they maintained social distancing with his extended family. Sources close to him said on Friday night that he and his immediate family stayed in a separate building on his parents’ property. Downing Street also denied that police officers had contacted anyone in his family as stated by Durham constabulary, and said that his actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines.This is not just Westminster tittle-tattle it is far more serious than that. It goes to the heart of the credibility of the government’s pandemic response. Ministers have set out clear guidelines that it has asked all citizens to abide by in order to protect the NHS and limit the number of deaths. Those guidelines include instructions that anyone in a household where someone has symptoms of Covid-19 should not leave their house for 14 days.Millions of people have complied with this guidance at huge personal cost. A boy died without his mother by his side people have been unable to spend time with relatives who have terminal illnesses. There have been missed funerals babies born who are yet to meet their grandparents single parents with Covid-19 who have struggled to care for their children while sick medical and care staff who have moved out of their homes to avoid putting their children at risk. These are sacrifices people have willingly made in order to protect healthcare workers and save lives.Of course this lockdown has involved unbearably difficult decisions of course parents have fretted what will happen to their children were they to become seriously ill. But many will have decided that they must comply with the government guidelines. How does it look when it turns out that a senior government adviser decided he was above the rules, and that the possibility he might need childcare help was worth the risk of two adults, infected with coronavirus, travelling hundreds of miles? It reeks of breathtaking arrogance and a callous disregard for the welfare of NHS and care staff.Worse still has been the response of the cabinet. Instead of insisting that Cummings resign, in the same way they did with other, less prominent government advisers who broke guidelines, senior ministers have rallied to Cummings’s defence. Michael Gove tweeted that caring for your wife and child is not a crime, as though those who obeyed government guidelines despite the implications for their families somehow cared less about them. Rishi Sunak appeared to accuse those asking the question about Cummings’s conduct as being motivated by political point-scoring. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, defended Cummings’s actions as “entirely right”. At yesterday’s press conference, Grant Shapps and the deputy chief medical officer gave conflicting messages about under what circumstances it might be permissible for someone to leave home if they live in a household where one or more members have symptoms. In shielding Cummings, ministers are revealing an ugly truth: they are willing to undermine the government’s public health messaging and its entire pandemic strategy – to risk people’s lives – in order to save their colleague’s job. It is a disgrace.The Observer gave the government the benefit of the doubt when this crisis broke: these are the most difficult governing circumstances a prime minister has faced for decades. But its response has been blighted by a catalogue of errors that it has declined to learn from: its failure to ensure there were adequate supplies of protective equipment in hospitals and care homes the delay in introducing social distancing that its scientific advisers now think might have resulted in more deaths the lags in building up testing capacity the failure to get a grip on the crisis in our care homes.Over the last week, worrying details have emerged about the flaws in the government’s track and trace strategy, which will be so critical in minimising outbreaks of the pandemic once social distancing is relaxed and schools are opened. It has outsourced the bulk of contact tracing newly recruited call-centre staff have reported receiving barely any training for what is considered a skilled job in the countries that have most successfully deployed tracing strategies. And it has delayed involving local councils and their public health experts in its plans. As fresh details emerge about Cummings’s trip to Durham, we can now add hypocrisy alongside incompetence to the charge sheet on this government’s handling of the pandemic. People who have missed out on seeing their loved ones one last time, who have struggled to care for their disabled child without their usual support, who have yet to meet the newest members of their family, will be angry. They are right to be. The country deserves better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad46e9c89e7fa7dabdcdd7060576466e0711f9ee/0_77_4895_2936/master/4895.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=dad5f594883cec92c901058b77baa722","title":"on my radar lisa taddeo cultural highlights revolutionary road fiona apple norimaki taschen modern art charles wysocki duolingo","story":"The American author on rewatching Revolutionary Road, Connecticut’s finest sushi restaurant – and the joy of jigsawsLisa Taddeo is an American author and journalist. Her debut book, Three Women, describing the lives and desires of ordinary women, was a bestseller when it was published last year. Taddeo lives in Connecticut with her husband and five-year-old daughter. She will be in conversation with the author Hallie Rubehnold on 31 May as part of the Hay festival digital programme.I’ve watched this three times in the past month, concurrently with reading the screenplay, because I’m working on some scripts. It’s so dark and frightening. It’s about a husband and wife, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The husband is happy in his job, but the wife, a stay-at-home mother, isn’t and wants them to move to Paris for a different life. He at first says yes, but he doesn’t really want to move because he’s comfortable. When she gets pregnant, she accuses him of knocking her up so they can’t go. It’s wild, and the note it ends on is shocking.Fiona Apple: Fetch the Bolt CuttersFiona Apple’s new album is startlingly raw, mesmerising and thumping. It really takes this pandemic into account, even though I’m pretty sure she wrote and recorded it before this all happened. It epitomises the female unrest that we’ve been going through with the #MeToo movement, but in a non-prescriptive, intensely emotional and gutting way. I’ve also been listening to Christine and the Queens her and Fiona Apple have been huge for me.Every once in a while we order in restaurant food, as some restaurants in our town do curbside delivery at the moment. There’s this kind of draconian dance you have to do: you get out of the car, you put your mask on, you use your gloves, you wipe your hands. We’re in rural Connecticut so there isn’t a lot, but there are a couple of lovely ones open. There’s a sushi place called Norimaki. It’s one of the best sushi restaurants I’ve ever been to – and I’ve lived in both New York City and LA.Modern Art: A History from Impressionism to TodayI know a lot of people have been doing puzzles. I love folk art, so the one we’ve been doing is a jigsaw by a brand called Buffalo Games, and the artist is Charles Wysocki. We started on the 500 piece, have now moved up to the 750 and are going slowly up to 1,000. We spend half an hour a day on it, so it takes weeks to complete, but it’s super fun and really takes your brain off things. You’re focused on something that’s beautiful and that isn’t work.I’m obsessed with this app called Duolingo that teaches languages through creative repetition. There’s a little owl who cheers you on when you’ve gotten a certain number of questions right. My daughter loves the owl, and his approval, perhaps more than she needs or wants mine. I’ve been teaching her three languages on it, which is kind of silly because she gets confused, but it keeps us busy. I’m Italian so I want her to learn Italian. She’s also learning a bit of Spanish in school. I’ve also selfishly wanted to learn French, so I’m throwing that in there too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac6be18f0b115b74e12a9a50129ccb0c7c6cf3d/0_235_6100_3658/master/6100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=839fa8ab60eea2b24a4143be7ceb9715","title":"what next for the arts rufus norris and maria balshaw swap notes","story":"The boss of the National Theatre and director of Tate Gallery discuss how culture has been hit by – and responded to – Covid-19, and what happens post-lockdown Erratic bandwidth is the least of the problems Norris and Balshaw face. Before lockdown, there was a £110bn creative industries sector, the fastest-growing in the UK. Now, the challenge is to keep cultural institutions out of intensive care. For although Arts Council England has launched a £160m emergency package across the cultural sector, the longer our museums and theatres remain closed, the more perilous their future becomes. But beyond the immediate question of when the Tate and National might reopen, this is, more positively, a moment of potential change: there are questions of how cultural appetites are altering as art in lockdown becomes more democratic. And questions about whether the Covid-19 crisis will make a good subject for theatre. What sort of art might develop post-lockdown?But before looking ahead, it is necessary to look back – not least because of the way time seems to be behaving in our new world (moving so fast in one sense, so slowly in another). I begin by asking Norris and Balshaw to remember how they felt as they locked down their institutions. Did they have any idea what was to come?Rufus Norris: It was very odd because we were told in the most blunt, ill-considered way that people were not to go to theatres before we were given any warning or told to shut. Boris’s announcement came just before a meeting with the cast of The Visit. We decided mutually the actors could not go on. Afterwards, I walked into the Olivier at 7.30 – the show should already have been running – and sat in the empty theatre. I remember thinking: how long will it be before I’m back in this theatre again? My overriding thought was about safety. This had all come up very quickly. I felt a bit naive, felt that collectively perhaps we should not have relied on government and made our own call earlier.Maria Balshaw is director of the UK’s four Tate art galleries in London, Liverpool and St Ives, a role she has held since 2017.\u0026nbsp Previously, she was director of the Whitworth, University of Manchester and Manchester City Galleries.After an illustrious 15 year directing career in the West End and theatres such as the Almeida and the Young Vic, Rufus Norris became artistic director of the National Theatre in 2015. Recent successes include My Country by Carol Ann Duffy and an adaptation of Andrea Levy’s Small Island.Maria Balshaw: Like Rufus, looking back, I wonder why I didn’t realise sooner that what happened needed to happen. The truth is we were all living in real time and society as a whole didn’t realise. I remember the acute strangeness of opening the Andy Warhol show at Tate Modern on 10 March. Our donors did not want to be there – already worried about the virus. The president of the Andy Warhol Foundation had flown over from New York and was saying: “Everyone thinks I’m crazy but I wanted to be here and witness this.” The opening felt incredibly celebratory yet presaging of disaster to come.How have your feelings changed over the ensuing weeks?RN: It’s been so fast-moving. The problem with closing down an organisation on the scale of the National is it takes a huge amount of effort, furloughing – nobody even knew how to spell that word a few weeks ago – and emergency planning. It’s like scrabbling in a swimming pool, trying to find the steps. When you don’t know what’s going on for a long period, it’s incredibly wearing. As the leader of an organisation, you’re not doing the job unless you look at the worst so you can start trying to plan ahead.MB: At the beginning, it was shocking but people thought the crisis would last three weeks. Possibly six. Now we’re at a moment where we have to think about more than the recovery of inidual institutions and our sectors. We’ve got to start thinking: how do we shape the world for the new normal? The pressures we’re under – financial, practical and emotional – mean we’ll not be the same on the other side.Teatro Franco Parenti in Milan is reducing seating from 500 to 65…RN: With the levels of subsidy in some European houses, that might be worth it but it’s out of the question for a commercial theatre.When will the NT’s money run out?RN: It depends on furloughing. If it keeps going, it won’t cover all our costs but will give us longer. Our turnover is £100m a year. In full swing, it costs two million a week to keep the place going. Some money comes from the Arts Council but we’re losing several million a month.MB: Like the National, we have reserves but even an organisation as large as Tate will face massive challenges. Rufus will be cross with me if I’m not frank about that. We’ll face a huge challenge if we have an extended period with very few visitors. The reopening of the Tate’s galleries won’t be immediate. Museums fall into the third phase of easing of restrictions which means London museums might open late July through to September, probably a few at a time.What plans are you putting into place?MB: All my colleagues are working at fever pitch to see how we can make museums open yet socially distant. How should we deal with hygiene and safety issues? How do we think about the numbers of people coming to us? In London, one of the biggest issues is going to be public transport. We don’t want it overwhelmed. We’ll be advocating that people who live locally walk to our institutions. I walk to work on good days – a fantastic thing to do in London.Will Tate have to start charging for entry?MB: We’ve done a remarkable amount through lockdown to reach new audiences. I want us to be there for the whole British public even if we have to welcome people in smaller numbers. I wouldn’t want to put a barrier in the way of anyone coming. Free entry is more important than ever.RN: We’re also looking into everything. We’ve a whole team working on creative ideas about social distancing. Can you get people masks? Can you build extra toilets? Can you only pre-order drinks? Can you put plastic screens between people on seats? What happens if you just do every other seat? We’ve cut production budgets in half. We’ve had wage cuts that our brilliant staff have had to take and it’s much worse for freelancers – they’re in a desperate position.The playwright James Graham suggests an “aggressive government bailout” is needed…RN: “Aggressive government bailout” feels blunt but we’ll need government support. The Arts Council does not expect us to fulfil our duties during lockdown – it’s not as if we have zero money coming in.And will smaller theatres survive?RN: Without support – no. If this goes on much longer, it’s very hard to imagine any theatre surviving. Whatever it means for the National, you can multiply several times for regional theatres. A lot of our work now is about advocacy to make sure the government, under huge pressure as it is, understands what our sector contributes and how urgent it is that a nuanced, informed view of helping us survive is taken on by them.How worried are you by surveys reporting that many people are frightened by the relaxation of lockdown? Does your role include a need to reassure the public?MB: Our world has changed beyond recognition. It’s understandable people feel fearful. Museums, galleries and the arts have a huge role to play in rebuilding social confidence. People may have to come differently – book a time slot, come in one way, leave another way. We’ll need to reassure the public the numbers will not put them at risk. And this is urgent because of another challenge our country now faces: people’s emotional wellbeing, social connections and mental health.RN: The worst thing would be if we opened too early because of financial need. If we rushed back and audiences came to our spaces and we hadn’t looked after them properly and they got sick – that must not be allowed to happen. It would be a disaster if we opened up and had to close down again. Reassurance will only be possible when the time is right.I gather you’ve been ill with the virus yourself, Rufus?RN: I was very ill for a couple of weeks but thankful it didn’t take me to hospital. I know a lot of people who have been very ill.Has this period made you reflect on what your jobs are for now that getting bums on seatspeople through doors is out of the equation?MB: We’re dealing with large-scale disaster management yet, in a more profound way, this crisis reminds us why human beings need art. You can see the hunger for it and people’s desire to create themselves. The silver lining of what we’re going through is that people have been given time back and are using it to make paintings, throw pots, watch theatre, dance and sing.RN: Or they’re also going back to their photographs or getting creative in the kitchen or garden – the surge of creativity is really encouraging. There’ll be a generation, won’t there? The lockdown generation – who really got on with stuff while they had the space.MB: I was particularly moved by the singing on balconies in Italy. It’s people saying: I’ll not be silent in the face of fear. It gets to the heart of why we make art. And then there was Sacha Lord’s livestream Hacienda-style Manchester club night that went on the whole night, attracted millions and raised funds for that bit of the creative sector. What a brilliant idea – people raving in their own homes! That’s an image I want to hold on to….Meanwhile NT at Home is hugely popular and has received more than £100,000 in donations…RN: It’s had 8 million views in the last five weeks. We weren’t expecting the donations but are now able to pay the actors. We’re introducing a broader range of titles. Our initial thinking was: people are going through a tough time, so what do they want? They want a comedy, so One Man, Two Guvnors… Sometimes, theatre can be a way of saying: “Just relax…”Will there be a new appetite for live art post-lockdown?MB: Just as people need to be back out in the world, they need to be seeing and thinking about art – it’s not a luxury. People have discovered so many new things digitally. It’s the hook that’s going to give them confidence to step out of their front doors again. I’ve made some wonderful discoveries during lockdown such as the live stream of Broken Wings by ENB – a ballet about Frida Kahlo.RN: I’ve found a variety of things – I especially enjoyed The Fireman’s Ball by Miloš Forman. I watched it with my partner and our two sons – a simple film, a satire. It appealed to our particular, weird, family taste. It’s hilarious. We have, obviously, been spending a lot more time together as a family – the one unadulterated, wonderful upside of lockdown.Are you in touch with colleagues in Europe and the US?MB: We’re actively in conversation in Europe, North America and beyond – we’re having Zoom meetings with colleagues in Italy and China because they’re at a different phase – there’s a huge amount to learn from them. We’re having brilliant creative conversations about how to reschedule touring exhibitions, make sure nobody loses out and let things happen over a longer time frame.Will lockdowncoronavirus make a good subject for arttheatre?RN: Yes – although it is difficult when you’re in the middle of something to understand what impact it will have. But new writing is sure to emerge… If we reopen in September, what will people want to watch? They’re going to be nervous. We’ll have to give them a good reason to come and make it a real event…MB: Early in lockdown, one of my staff – an artist – sent a lovely message saying: “The artists among us have been practising lockdown for some time.” Unlike theatre-makers, artists depend on time apart. But it is possible lockdown might make artists focus in a new way. The deep emotional issues raised by this virus will infiltrate their minds as they have ours.What specifically are the emotional issues?MB: We’ve been going through a period of collective mourning because we took everyday social contact for granted – that sense of ourselves as human beings as part of a larger social whole. That’s been fundamentally challenged. We operated societally and inidually as though we could overcome anything. We could fix things, cure things or pay to get ourselves out of difficult situations. None of those options has been open to us. Living with a sense of uncertainty is what people have been having to get used to. You can see they’re desperate for resolution: please tell us the answers. The truth is we don’t know how we are going to recover. Yet once we know we can reopen, I think we’ll definitely be ready.RN: Having been starved of live art, it’ll be like coming back to food you have been denied, there’ll be a great appetite for it. The crucial thing is to make sure we are there for audiences when that happens.The National Theatre is streaming productions for free on YouTube as part of National Theatre at Home (nationaltheatre.org.uknt-at-home)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2385b3b9862f62bd99cba9b9974d8c6c6b24f76b/0_1928_4935_2959/master/4935.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0ff71f2aec773939b2ddccb3eb2d1f6","title":"time for a government u turn over the uks shocking child poverty levels","story":"Nine children in every school class of 30 are poor, as teachers know well. Has the pandemic at last made ministers care about it?If there is a consensus emerging from the awful coronavirus pandemic, it is this: it has shone a spotlight on child poverty and the damage it does to young lives.Politicians who voted for austerity measures – including the two-child cap on child benefit and the five-week delay to the first payment of universal credit – that cruelly punished disadvantaged children, have rediscovered a concern for those whose lives have been blighted by their actions.In 2018-19 some 4.2 million children in the UK were trapped in poverty. Shockingly, this means nine children in every class of 30 are poor.In a recent survey National Education Union members told harrowing tales of children without coats, with ill-fitting, ripped shoes. Children who are tired and thin. Children with mental health issues unable to get help. Children with bed-bug infestations and rats in their homes. Given these experiences, it is no surprise that these children find it more difficult to learn without the support and structure schools give.Throughout the lockdown, teachers have worked hard to support poor children’s learning. Schools have remained open for the most vulnerable pupils, although not all have taken up their place for fear of catching Covid-19 and spreading it to their family.Staff have been regularly contacting vulnerable children. Some have been delivering food to their homes. A huge amount of thought and effort has gone into devising new ways to support learning at home. My union created a parents’ website to support children’s education through creative, enjoyable activities that make learning fun.Teachers, leaders and support staff want schools to open for more pupils. They know how important the structure of school is in poor children’s lives. They miss their daily interaction with children and young people and the opportunities this brings to support and help them, to take care of them.The government’s fixation on the 1 June date has been entirely unhelpful because it has taken attention away from what is important: the safety of children, their communities and school staff.Before any wider school opening there must be evidence that the virus is under control, a fully functioning test, trace and isolate system running, and plans in place to keep children, their families, their communities and school staff as safe as they can be from a second spike of Covid-19.We now need to build a consensus that child poverty is not something we have to live with and ameliorate as best we can – because its effects are real, lifelong and pernicious. A truly civilised society would not tolerate hungry, badly clothed children living acutely stressful lives, resulting in debilitating mental and physical problems.The consequences of Covid-19 will be felt for a long time. Schools practising social distancing will not be able to accommodate anything like a full pupil cohort for months, if not longer. So the government must devise a plan to support all children, with priority for poor children, to give them easy access to learning, with a national programme of blended, home and school learning.The government should bring forward a raft of economic and social policies with one aim: to eradicate child poverty.One positive of the pandemic has been the focus on child poverty. This must not be lost in the aftermath. • Mary Bousted is joint general secretary of the National Education Union"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3a2c3918c7397d4d7464e380718955505fdbbf/0_299_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=490b3355cb4f9b95e3723aeac62b0440","title":"mini rewilders restore britains woodland aoe","story":"By buying and managing small wooded plots, enthusiasts are bringing bioersity back to the countrysideTamara and Steve Davey cannot help but grin at the suggestion they are “miniature rewilders”. Standing proudly in the weak sunlight on the fringes of Dartmoor national park, the full-time grandmother and taxi company owner delight in their eight-acre woodland.Robins, tits and siskins chortle in the trees. Nightjars are welcome visitors in the summer. Seven bat species have been recorded in their small plot. There’s a badger’s sett somewhere in the hillside scrub. And the couple feel at peace.“It’s good for the soul,” says Tamara, speaking before the coronavirus lockdown. “It’s one of the best things we’ve ever done,” Steve agrees. “If we can make a difference and help what’s here, I’ll be happy.”“Being among it and just listening to the sounds of nature is priceless, really. And you’re expanding your knowledge. You’re learning about different things all the time,” Steve says, expressing his love for summer evenings in the forest after a day driving his taxi. “We didn’t have any formal qualifications in land management or forestry. I’ve had a keen interest in wildlife all my life but, yeah, it’s enriching.”The couple bought their piece of land through Woodlands, which sells all kinds of plots – from one acre to more than 20 – at about £10,000 an acre, from the Highlands to rural Cornwall. Many owners buy their land to help promote bioersity and reverse the effects of poor woodland management. The Daveys are no different.Six years before they purchased their plot in 2018, the woodland was clear-felled and replaced with more than 2,000 non-native Sitka spruce, which are commonly grown in commercial plantations in the UK and are poor for bioersity. Tamara and Steve have begun the daunting task of replacing the fast-growing conifer with sweet chestnuts, birches, oaks and native hedging to support wildlife, adding the occasional pool and clearing for bats and amphibians.“In providing new habitats and new species, I think that’s achievable. The insects, the invertebrates, they’ve got to be catered for. If you haven’t got those, then the whole ecosystem is not so healthy. Having the grass areas, the ponds, they’ll create a huge amount of wildlife,” says Steve.Management often mimics natural processes such as storm damage, which creates areas of wildlife-rich dead wood. Coppicing – cutting back trees to ground level on a five- to 20-year cycle – allows light to reach the forest floor. Before humans, large grazing animals such as bison would have browsed forests to maintain areas of low growth. This mix of dead wood, healthy trees, saplings and open spaces creates a rich mosaic of habitats.“A well-managed woodland is more likely to have greater bioersity than an unmanaged woodland. The basic principle is that allowing light in attracts all sorts of tiers of bioersity,” says author Robert Penn, who bought a cottage enclosed by trees on the edge of the Black Mountains in Wales 17 years ago.The 2.5-acre wood was previously owned by a couple who had little interest in woodland management and it had grown dark and unwieldy. Unlike the Daveys’ wood, Penn’s plot was mainly native trees that had been left to run wild.He opened up his tiny woodland by coppicing and thinning out weaker trees to let in the light. Woodland flowers – which can lie dormant for decades – started to flourish and the plot is now peppered with wood anemones, stitchwort, celandine, primroses and wild garlic.These spaces also provide sanctuary from the modern world. “The woodland is absolutely fundamental to my existence,” says Penn, who is patron of the Small Woods Association. “This morning, for instance, I was in my woodland and it was incredibly beautiful – wildflowers are just starting to come up, trees are about to bud, the wood is absolutely packed with birds. It’s splendid.”Several wildlife trusts in the UK have reported increased interest in people wanting to buy land for tree planting, landowners wanting advice on carbon offsetting and communities starting tree-planting schemes. Aside from the wildlife benefits, small woods provide important ecosystem services such as reducing air pollution, locking carbon into the soil and temperature regulation. These benefits are worth hundreds of millions of pounds, according to analysis by the Office for National Statistics. Penn’s one tip to fellow forest owners is to be patient, because managing woodland is a long-term project. “It was five years before I felt the wood was genuinely my own … and a decade later I’m absolutely confident I’m doing the right thing and I take immeasurable pleasure out of the whole thing.”In Tortington, West Sussex, Julie and Tony Upson manage 4.5 acres of ancient semi-natural woodland. Hazel trees dominate but a majestic veteran yew stands proudly and the former palliative care nurse and city law firm facilities manager are trying to encourage the heather back on a former heath.The couple adore the dormice that live in their woodland and credit their small forest with giving them a vibrant retirement where they spend lots of time together and bond with a community of other foresters.“We do wish we’d done this earlier but we didn’t have the money,” Julie says, adding that the forest helped her cope with cancer treatment.“It does give you the opportunity for unusual birthday presents. I bought Julie an axe one year and her friend thought it was a really bizarre present!” says Tony.To others who might want to turn their hands to managing woodland for bioersity, the couple have one message: “Go for it.”“We’re not owners, we’re custodians of this bit of ground and these trees. Everything we do is not for us, it’s for future generations and for the planet,” says Tony."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca5b9b7db5974b47aa27f86fb122925a7c3977a1/492_0_4361_2619/master/4361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a5c1ba7c007e9704ef8e246c62984a8","title":"us dams michigan report infrastructure","story":"More than 15,000 dams in the US would likely kill people if they failed, and at least 2,300 of them are in poor or unsatisfactory condition, according to recent data from the federal government’s National Inventory of Dams.The country’s neglected and deteriorating dam infrastructure is coming to light as heavy rains and two dam failures in Michigan have caused catastrophic flooding and forced thousands to evacuate their homes in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.The problem will only become more serious as the climate crisis disrupts rain patterns, experts warn.The average age of a US dam is 57 years, and many – like the Michigan dams – were built in the early 20th century, when states had not yet set safety standards. US dams received a “D” rating from the American Society of Civil Engineers in its most recent review in 2017.“Unfortunately, some state programs don’t have the resources they need to follow through,” Ogden said. “These can be very expensive repairs … so if the owner is unable or unwilling to do that, it takes a lot of time and resources to go through the enforcement process.”Many dams, for example, were built by neighborhood developers who wanted to create bodies of water for recreation, Ogden said. Then they were turned over to homeowners’ associations unprepared to maintain them.Ogden said repairing dams and preparing emergency plans will become even more important with more frequent intense rainfall.If the ground is already saturated with rain before a heavy downpour, a dam could overtop or even burst.“Over time hopefully we’ll see improvements in specific dams that may be vulnerable to this, but it will take time and unfortunately will take expense and cost for owners to be able to upgrade,” Ogden said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1986303c3e788924bac6519fb35bebb4b9f2e449/0_0_6016_4000/master/6016.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71df9d6343fe890d86d39249b99d5ef3 880w","title":"model behaviour naomi campbell at 50","story":"As the supermodel hits her milestone birthday, we look back at her life in the spotlight"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d735f5d9e0aecb497aa5d44e2b5bab7c4f11aec9/0_0_1000_1000/master/1000.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=50a6337bc74a5f4c68d053a579949d8b 1440w","title":"top chefs turn their hand to takeaways during coronavirus pandemic","story":"Michelin-star chefs everywhere have started rethinking their menus and delivering foodFoodies around the world are waking to a brave new culinary world.

Closed since mid-March, but with the country’s lockdown restrictions now eased, Noma has opened with a “drop-in only” system.There are just two burgers on offer: the “Noma cheeseburger” and the “Noma veggie burger”, both described as being “packed with umami, with a little bit of magic from our fermentation cellar, and served on a freshly baked potato bun.” The restaurant will be open from 1pm to 9pm Thursdays to Sundays.The cheeseburger, featuring dry-aged bavette steak, beef garum (a fermented sauce with roots in ancient Rome), cheddar cheese, sliced red onion, pickles and a house-made mayonnaise, and the vegetarian option, featuring quinoa tempeh, will be served for at least the next six weeks.“We feel in the first phase of the reopening that we want to be open for all,” said Redzepi. “We need to heal, so let’s have a glass and a burger. You’re all invited.”Noma’s adaptation is part of a global culinary trend. In France, Guy Savoy – among the world’s most celebrated chefs – decided to begin offering a takeaway service from Le Chiberta, his Paris restaurant near the Arc de Triomphe, when lockdown restrictions were lifted on 11 May. He served up an abbreviated menu including his two signature dishes – artichoke soup with truffles and parmesan, and a ballotine of poultry with foie gras and a truffle vinaigrette.The coronavirus pandemic has forced restaurants to roll down their shutters across the UK too. But over the past few weeks, behind these darkened windows the restaurant kitchens have been a hive of activity. Fresh tagliatelle has been rolled out and lamb chops have been seasoned to perfection, with some of the country’s best chefs adapting to takeaway services to survive.Bombay Bustle, an Indian restaurant in London’s Mayfair inspired by the dabbawalas (the Mumbai institution of couriers who use bicycles and urban trains to deliver home-cooked lunches to workers across the city) has launched a delivery service in keeping with this ethos.Across the river in Bermondsey, the Michelin-starred chef Angela Hartnett has been serving up dishes for customers in their homes for three weeks.Hartnett says the venture has been a success and she plans to continue delivering food to customers once lockdown restrictions are fully lifted. She has had to furlough her staff and has been in the kitchen with her husband, Neil Borthwick, and their lodger, Salvatore, cooking up to 40 covers every Thursday, Friday and Saturday.She said: “There are just three of us and I’m doing lots of the cooking myself, so it’s actually been very busy, and the feedback we’ve had from customers has been really good. I can see us carrying this on once this is all over as it’s been a real success.”Hartnett said customers still wanted good food even though they were confined to their homes, with some even making multiple orders from different restaurants.“I’ve seen photographs on social media of their meals with gnocchi they’ve ordered from me and chops that they’ve got from the River Cafe. I think people will still want to come out to restaurants regardless because they like that experience, but this has shown that they also want this type of food in their own home.”For chefs who have not been able to reopen their businesses even to offer takeaways, such as Mary-Ellen McTague in Manchester and Mark Birchall, who clocked up two Michelin stars within two years of opening his Lancashire restaurant, the lockdown has been an opportunity to turn their talents to charitable work.McTague, who runs the Creameries in the suburb of Chorlton, launched the Eat Well MCR hospitality collective in response to the crisis. “We tried doing takeout for a week but it was really difficult to socially distance so we stopped. But I still wanted to do something, otherwise I’d go mad, so I launched Eat Well and we have been cooking for NHS workers and homeless people ever since,” she said.McTague and her band of volunteers and chefs have been using their skills to cook and deliver around 2,000 meals to homeless hostels and hospitals across the city. “It has been an absolute privilege to serve these people,” she added.Birchall, who had to close his restaurant and hotel, Moor Hall in Aughton, west Lancashire, has been sending food parcels with soups, broths and cake to vulnerable children and their families in Liverpool.The che supports the Sandy Park Cafe, a not-for-profit social enterprise helping young students with special needs and disabilities from Sandfield Park school in Liverpool to gain work experience. “The children haven’t been able to come into the cafe and some of them are very vulnerable so we wanted to do something for them,” he said. “We can’t open the restaurant – but this is our way of doing something for people who really need some help at the moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c60a96040add0b28a900eb5ee2db2adcab3064c/0_437_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c792207d10bf9ada12a6a82f6bdf01c4","title":"mexican rave the 10 best tequila cocktails chosen by experts","story":"Lockdown has sent tequila sales soaring. But forget the salt and lemon and try these simple yet luscious recipes chosen by bartenders and other aficionadosSo why have we all been reaching for the salt and lemon? Actually, we probably haven’t. The (not particularly traditional) tequila cruda ritual has gradually fallen out of favour, with the spirit gaining popularity as a cocktail ingredient instead. In the US, the sales spike may be attributed to Cinco de Mayo celebrations – commemorating the Mexican army’s 1862 victory over France – which took place at the beginning of this month. But the increase in demand could also be down to the fact that production of tequila, which can be made only in Mexico, has been allowed to continue during the coronavirus crisis. The spirit is deemed an agricultural product, while breweries, for example, have been forced to close.“Tequila is associated with holidays and being at the beach, and while people are in lockdown they want to replicate that feeling a little bit,” says Eduardo Gomez, the owner of Mex Grocer and the founder of London’s Tequila \u0026amp Mezcal festival. With this in mind, we asked bartenders and tequila experts to share their favourite make-at-home recipes.Erik Lorincz, owner of Kwānt, LondonBlend 50ml tequila, 30ml lime juice and 15ml agave nectar with fresh coriander (to taste). Pour the mixture into a shaker or jar filled with ice and shake well. Double strain (using a tea strainer, to make sure there are no bits of coriander in the drink) and top up with pink grapefruit soda (I use Three Cents or Two Keys sodas). Leave out the coriander to make another popular tequila cocktail: the Paloma. Eduardo Gomez, owner of Mex Grocer and founder of Tequila \u0026amp Mezcal FestVictor Tutuianu, bar manager at the Lost Alpaca bar at Lima Floral, LondonTake 30ml of tequila (we recommend Patrón Anejo), 15ml of bourbon (any decent one will do), 50ml fresh pineapple juice, 20ml sugar syrup (easy to make at home – just mix one part water and two parts sugar), 25ml fresh lime juice, a vanilla pod (or dash of vanilla syrupessence) and two drops of orange bitters. Pour over ice in a shaker. Shake well and strain over ice. Garnish with fresh pineapple for an extra kick of summer.Joseph Cribley, director of Bar Pina, Sheffield There’s still a bit of a stigma around tequila – people think that they don’t like it. An espresso martini is a good introduction because the tequila is surrounded by familiar flavours. Ordinarily, an espresso martini contains vodka, but our version is a bit richer, with more caramel flavours.Add 40ml of espresso (the fresher the better) to 30ml of reposado tequila (reposado means it is aged for two to 12 months in barrels, so it has more sweetness and more vanilla or butterscotch flavours) we use Vivir. Blend with 20ml of coffee liqueur (we use Kahlua, but Patrón Cafe is just as good), 15ml of agave syrup, a pinch of kosher salt and a couple of ice cubes. You want to get some texture into the drink and this can be done using a Nutribullet or hand blender. Alternatively, half-fill a sports bottle with ice and give it a really good shake. Either way, the aeration makes it velvety and smooth.Mark Selby, cofounder of Wahaca, nationwide Tequila is a magic drink. During lockdown, people are discovering that it perhaps isn’t the drink they thought it was. In their younger years, it may have been associated with bad hangovers, but you can make really good, refreshing drinks with it.One thing that makes a big difference is sticking your glass in the freezer for 10 minutes (or the fridge for an hour) beforehand. The mix of ginger and tequila here makes for a really uplifting drink. Build and stir (rather than shake) 35ml blanco tequila​, 125ml ginger beer, 20ml fresh lime juice​ and 5ml vanilla syrup​ (this can be made by boiling and cooling a mix of water, caster syrup and vanilla extract). Garnish with a wedge of lime and Angostura bitters. Deano Moncrieffe, cofounder of Hacha, LondonThe acidity of the sauvignon blanc in this recipe helps balance out the sweetness of the agave syrup. Start by mixing 25ml each of agave syrup and sauvignon blanc in a small jug until it is a consistent liquid. Then add to a tall glass with 50ml blanco tequila and 25ml freshly squeezed lime and lemon juice (equal measures of each). Top up with soda water or bitter lemon and ice cubes, and stir. It’s almost a cross between a spritz and a margarita – very refreshing on a nice day.Ben Reilly, bar manager at Luck Lust Liquor \u0026amp Burn, ManchesterThe perception of tequila is changing. This drink is super-fresh and unusual, and easy enough to make at home. You don’t need a shaker or strainer and it’s perfect for the sunny weather. Take 50ml blanco tequila, one scoop of lemon sorbet, 25ml lime juice, a pinch of mint and 10ml blood orange syrup (any fruity syrup will work). Mix together then top with crushed ice and grapefruit soda.Ryan Chetiyawardana AKA Mr Lyan, owner of Lyaness and Cub, LondonIn warmer weather, zesty drinks are what’s called for. Of course, riffs on sours such as margarita are great, but shaking can be a hassle. If you want something more fuss-free to kick back with, highballs are ideal. Start by making a salted raspberry syrup: bring 100ml water to the boil, turn off the heat, then add 100g sugar and a handful of raspberries and a hefty pinch of salt. Whisk to dissolve the sugar, allow to cool, then pass through a sieve. Keep refrigerated – this will make plenty of servings.James Aspell, owner of 400 Rabbits, Nottingham The mangarita is a delicious, fruity cocktail that’s perfect for summer. Mix 50ml blanco tequila with 30ml mango juice (you can make this at home by blending fresh mango with a splash of water), 25ml fresh lime juice and 10ml agave syrup. Shake with lots of ice and strain. Serve straight up in a martini glass or coupette and garnish with a twist of mango peel.Make a “pro-gave” syrup by mixing equal parts prosecco with agave syrup. Then take 60ml reposado tequila (we use Espolon), 10ml of the pro-gave syrup, two dashes of orange bitters and two dashes of angostura bitters, and build over ice. Stir for 30 seconds, then serve in a rocks glass or tumbler."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00898b8dbdb585974f5b99116ac6320fb15a5ec5/0_213_4879_2928/master/4879.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7517cb33744cde5c6b43b2fca873155c","title":"theres more to pork rind than crackling waste not tom hunt","story":"Leftover pork rind boosts the flavour of this grill delicacy based on Italian sausageIt’s ironic that one of the most wasted parts of a pig is also one of the most delicious. Pork scratchings are a classic snack, while the crackling upon a mighty loin of roast pork is one of the most revered delicacies of British cuisine: puffy, sweet, golden and crunchy, and altogether unctuous with a salty twang.Pork rind is removed from bacon, chops and other cuts to refine them, but these days there is little demand for this delectable offal, so, once removed, it rarely makes it on to our plates and is instead rendered down for cosmetic products. Woe to the pig.The good news, however, is that most butchers will will happily set some aside and sell it to you. If you want to save waste, next time you make roast pork, also procure some rind – but do make sure to get enough crackling to go around. Save the rind from your bacon, chop it up and use it instead of oil in the bases for soups and stews. Or have a go at this week’s recipe for Italian-inspired cotechino meatballs.As a vegetarian, it would be remiss of me not to mention sustainability within this context. Intensive animal agriculture has the most damaging anthropogenic impact on our planet, but omnivores who enjoy pasture-reared, thrifty cuts of meat will reduce this impact without damaging their wallets.This classic Italian sausage is usually squeezed into sausage casings, then poached and served with lentils. Unless you have a good Italian deli nearby, it can be hard to find, however, and takes a very long time to cook – about three hours in all – so I’ve written this recipe to be a relatively quick one to cook on the grill. It is a super-rich delicacy that, thanks to the pork rind, is well worth making. I first had it at River Cottage, when we used to make something similar on the Pig In A Day butchery course with the legendary Ray Smith. Ray would always say how important it is to know where your meat comes from, to ensure its quality.300g pork rind200g streaky bacon, roughly chopped500g pork mince2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped50ml red wine1 tsp fennel seeds1 tsp freshly ground black pepper4 tsp sea salt1 pinch mace or nutmeg1 pinch clove powderCooked lentils and salsa verde, to serve (optional)Simmer the pork rind in hot water for an hour, until really soft, then drain and chop finely.Mix thoroughly with the bacon, pork mince, garlic,wine, fennel seeds, pepper, salt, mace (or nutmeg) and clove powder.Roll the mix into 20 balls, then grill or barbecue these over a low heat for 15-20 minutes, turning them as little as possible, and serve with lentils and salsa verde or in buns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d3eafc46edcf08be130591851ca2b966e13ac4/0_150_3386_2031/master/3386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=876d8e67c93910a4599ecc82b2ef6052","title":"erling braut haaland ronaldo streltsov miracle simplicity","story":"Erling Braut Haaland’s ability to make the game look so easy is reminiscent of the Brazilian and Russian prodigies, whose cautionary tales show talent should not be taken for grantedOf course it was Erling Braut Haaland who scored the first Bundesliga goal after the resumption. Who else could it have been? Nobody else in the modern game seems to play with such a disregard for complication. Nobody else seems to treat the basic problem of getting the ball from his foot to the back of the net with the brusque clarity of Alexander contemplating the Gordian Knot. Nobody else seems such an embodiment of tomorrow.Haaland’s goal against Schalke last Saturday was beautifully simple as he muscled on to a low cross to score with a first-time finish. But that description, though true, underplays the quality of the goal. The timing of the run to remain onside while getting in front of the defender was perfect, while the finish, opening his foot to guide the ball past the Schalke goalkeeper, Markus Schubert, was exquisite, requiring the sort of instinctive understanding of pace and spin and angles that the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould celebrates in Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville.The calculations required for great athletic performance, he points out, are (literally) inconceivable: “The required action simply doesn’t grant sufficient time for the sequential processing of conscious decisions.” Yet Haaland’s most obvious asset is his physique. Occasionally players come along who seem to have been built on a different scale. In 1954 word began to spread about a brilliant 16-year-old forward at Torpedo Moscow, Eduard Streltsov. Because of the weather, the Soviet season always began in the south so Torpedo’s first game in the capital was their sixth of the campaign, away against Lokomotiv. Not much was happening when Streltsov turned, pushed the ball into space, barged through two defenders, whipped past another and then smashed his shot into the net. It was, as his biographer, Alexander Nilin, wrote, “a miracle of simplicity”. Streltsov’s genius was confirmed.What followed is one of the great mysteries of Soviet sport. Streltsov became a star, an awkward status to have in Nikita Khrushchev’s USSR. Then, 62 years ago on Monday, he was accused of raping a woman at a party on the last night of the national team’s pre-World Cup training camp at Tarasovka, just outside Moscow. He was convicted and served six years in the gulag.His case has fascinated fans and historians ever since. Garry Kasparov led a campaign to clear his name, while the researcher Axel Vartanyan has spent much of the past three decades sifting through KGB archives to try to work out what happened, regularly publishing articles about new pieces of information he has found.The rape and the various conspiracy theories around it understandably dominate contemporary discourse but those four years between his debut and Tarasovka are also revealing, less for what they say about Streltsov than about the way we treat those for whom the game seems to come so easily.In 1954 football was in the early stages of revolution. A back four and zonal marking were taking root in Brazil. The quietly radical coach Viktor Maslov had left Torpedo the previous season but would return in 1957 the following decade he would pioneer pressing and the 4-4-2 formation at Dynamo Kyiv. Fundamentals of the game that had stood inviolable for a quarter of a century were beginning to be challenged. Then amid all the tactical discussion and the theories, along came a 16-year-old who just knocked the ball into space, swatted aside opponents and thumped the ball past the keeper.What response could there be to Haaland’s second against Paris Saint-Germain in February but to laugh at its ridiculous simplicity? Or think of Bobby Robson’s reaction to Ronaldo’s goal against Compostela in 1996, clutching his head in disbelief that somebody could make the game look so easy.Haaland is 19. Ronaldo had just turned 20. Streltsov was 16. Perhaps only the young, unencumbered by the complications and doubts of experience, have the clarity to approach football with such insolence. Because to make the game look so straightforward is problematic. It offends against the lore of the game. If it is that easy, why can’t they do it all the time? But of course it’s not that easy. Haaland, Ronaldo and Streltsov scored those goals not only because they were stronger and quicker than opponents but because the space opened up for them and they had the awareness to identify and seize the opportunity, to know when to push the ball into a gap and at what pace, to know when the forces would align in such a way that defenders could be brushed aside. Sometimes, perhaps, that vision isn’t with them. Sometimes the disposition of players on the pitch isn’t right. But the wider point is that made by Gould: just because they make something look easy doesn’t mean it isn’t genius.That very ease makes us perhaps undervalue those moments. Between 1954 and 1958, there was criticism of Streltsov for the games in which he seemed to do nothing. Coaches spoke of his hypochondria, the days when he would complain his legs felt heavy and they would almost have to push him out on to the pitch. He moaned about his flat feet and playing in the heat of summer. Expectation and the frustration when he failed to deliver – his own and that of others – sapped at him. Ronaldo, too, struggled to live up to his talent and promise. Exactly what happened before the 1998 World Cup final remains unclear but the wider pattern of him being pushed to the limits of physical endurance was clear.The temptation is to look on such forwards as though they are heaven-sent heroes, endowed with great gifts to do great things. There is a danger of taking them for granted, as though with that physique there is something inevitable about their brilliance. There is not. The strain – physical, mental and emotional – can still be enormous.Haaland is a wonderful talent, capable of making football look the most absurdly simple thing, but we shouldn’t be lured into thinking it is simple, that it comes without cost, even for him. We should never let ourselves believe his excellence is routine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8749e2987ea5732d98b05a2e9b2ceb9e7de8e204/0_225_5923_3554/master/5923.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c749bd2716dca5691265069484566922","title":"an a to z of calming and inspiring words for troubling times","story":"Have a ‘kaffeeklatsch’ until you become ‘unsoulclogged’: archaic soothing terms to use in troubling timesLike language, our emotions are universal and whatever fears and anxieties we are now experiencing, someone else in centuries gone by has felt the same way. Here is an A-Z of archaic and forgotten words that at some point in the past exactly described an elusive sense of peace, calm and delight. So, if you want to know your agathism from your euneirophrenia, read on and draw comfort from these linguistic odditiesAgathism It’s hard to be an optimist knowing that there are tough times ahead. But in lieu of optimism, there’s always agathism – a word coined in 1830 for the belief that all things eventually get better, though the means by which they do is not always easy. It is a word to remind us that though we may be in for hard times, there is light at the end of the tunnel.Bummel Our daily constitutional needn’t be an exhausting run around the block. Derived from a German word for “strolling”, a bummel is nothing more than a relaxing leisurely walk or wander.Concubium Adopted into English from Latin in the 1600s, the concubium is the soundest, calmest, deepest part of your sleep. “That time of night when all men are at rest”, as one 17th-century dictionary put it.Dolorifuge Whatever it is that makes you happy, that is your dolorifuge: this 19th-century term describes anything or anyone that alleviates feelings of pain or sadness.Euneirophrenia One of the strangest side-effects of our curtailed routines at the moment is that our brains are working overtime while we sleep, so the word “euneirophrenia” might come in useful. It describes the wholly pleasing feeling you have on waking from an equally pleasant dream.Focillation Derived from the Latin for “nourish”, a focillation is a momentary act of comfort or refreshment. Take it as a reminder that it is perfectly fine to take some time out, whenever you need it.Glee-dream If you find solace in films or music, or find that you’re dearly missing the theatre or cinema, the word you are looking for is glee-dream. The modern form of the Old English “gleodream”, the Oxford English Dictionary defines this as “delight of minstrelsy” – that is, the pleasure that comes from a musical performance or similar entertainment.Heterocentric How we all should – and, thankfully, how a great many of us currently are – living our lives: if you’re heterocentric then you’re more concerned with other people than you are yourself.Interfulgent A fitting metaphor for the triumph of light in dark times. Derived from the Latin word for “shining”, something that is interfulgent shines through or between that which would otherwise obscure it – as sunshine through clouds or the leaves of trees.Jamb-friend A jamb is a supporting timber, of course, which makes a jamb-friend an early 19th-century word for a friend with whom you could quite happily sit by a fireside talking and relaxing well into the early hours.Kaffeeklatsch Borrowed from German in the 1800s, a kaffeeklatsch is a chattering catch-up with friends and family over endless cups of coffee. It’s a lot more poetic than the Victorian alternative: according to one contemporary dictionary, “scandal-loving women” who like to “meet over a cup of tea” were once known as muffin-wallopers.Laetificate It’s a word not much used since the 1600s, but it’s one you might need today – or might be called on to offer to someone else. Quite simply, to laetificate is to lift someone’s spirits.Meliorism George Eliot coined the word “meliorism” to define her outlook on life, once writing to the psychologist James Sully to explain that: “I don’t know that I ever heard anybody use the word ‘meliorist’ except myself.” Operating halfway between optimism and realism, meliorism is the belief that the world – no matter what shape it may be in – can always be improved by the concerted effort of mankind.Nikhedonia Nike was the Greek goddess of victory. Hedone (as in hedonism) was a Greek word for pleasure. Put those two together and you have nikhedonia – a term from psychology for the inspiring, adrenalin-raising excitement of anticipating a future success.Omnibenevolence Just as an omnipotent person has power over everything, an omnibenevolent person exhibits kindness to everything and everyone. That endless, all-encompassing compassion is omnibenevolence.Peeled-egg We’re all guilty of worrying that the worst could suddenly befall us, but rarely imagine that something just as unexpectedly wonderful could take place. JRR Tolkien coined the word “eucatastrophe” to describe an unforeseen event of sheer good fortune, but the Scots beat him to it. First recorded in Scottish proverbs dating from the 1800s, a peeled-egg is: “A stroke of good fortune which one has not had to strive for.” It was once a popular name given to farms established on land with unanticipated natural advantages.Queem Something described as queem is perfectly calm or serene – or by extension, perfectly smooth and level. Queemness, likewise, can be used to describe perfect serenity, or perfect smoothness and levelness, while two things that work queemly with one another are either perfectly harmonious, or, like two parts of a joint, snug and well adapted to one another.Retrouvailles Adopted from French, retrouvailles literally means “refinding” – but it’s more usually understood as the French equivalent of what we might call a reunion or homecoming. Recently the word came to be used more imaginatively to describe the utter happiness or joy sparked by reuniting or catching up with someone you haven’t seen in a long time. A word well worth recalling in the months ahead.Supernaculum It might be a fine glass of wine or whisky – or nothing more than a perfectly brewed and timed cup of tea. A supernaculum is a drink so appreciated that it is savoured to its very last drop.Traumatropism A tree partly felled by gales or lightning can often continue growing – albeit in some ever more unwieldy or implausible shape. That undeterred response to earlier damage is an example of a phenomenon called traumatropism. Taken literally, it reminds us that nature is stronger and more resilient than we could ever imagine metaphorically, it tells us that harsh setbacks need not end our progress.Unsoulclogged It’s not the most handsome of words, but we’re all striving to be unsoulclogged. It is total contentment, peace of mind, and freedom from sadness and dejection – or, as one 1881 dictionary defined it, the state of “not being weighed down in spirit”.Villeggiatura When you’re tired of the city or your usual routine, it’s time for a villeggiatura. Adopted into English from Italian in the 18th century, a villeggiatura is a restorative trip or holiday to the countryside, taken to lift the spirits and unwind the mind.Worldcraft Ageing is hardly the most welcome of life’s certainties. But for every word to remind us of its drawbacks (to be eildencumbered is to be held back by age), there is one for its seldom considered positives. Worldcraft is an 18th-century word for the unmatched cumulative wisdom of an aged person whose long life has given them unique and much venerated insight – far beyond anything a younger, less experienced person could ever imagine.Xenodochy Hospitality offered to strangers. The prefix xeno comes from the Greek word for “strange” or “foreign”, but we only tend to encounter it today in xenophobia. Now seems an apt time to highlight one of its overlooked opposites.Yahrsider We are all looking out for our yahrsiders at the moment. A dialect term from the 18th century, a yahrsider is someone from the same family or town as you, or who shares the same community spirit.Zenobia A courageous and effective third-century queen of Palmyra, Zenobia expanded her kingdom into the almighty Palmyrene Empire, stretching from Ankara to Aswan. Her name has been adopted as a term for a powerful, unstoppably determined woman.

He has a waiting list of 300 repair jobs, and bike sales tripled in April compared with the same time last year.“I’ve never experienced it like this,” said Steve Pettitt of Steve’s Cycles in Hull. “My repair jobs have doubled at least. People have been bringing bikes in that have been behind the garage for years.”He said sales of kit such as helmets and saddles were also going well as parents took children out on the road. “You are actually seeing families out together,” he said.One independent retailer said his wholesale supplier had cleared its entire annual stock in four weeks.Graham Stapleton, the chief executive of Halfords, said the buyers were not the usual “mamils” – middle-aged men in lycra. “We’ve seen a big growth in the number of female customers,” he said, “and younger, under-35s buying bikes.”For years most of the growth in the market has come from expensive road bikes favoured by those “mamils”, while sales of commuter and family bikes have been pedestrian.But in the past few weeks family and commuter-friendly hybrid bikes costing less than £1,000 have been racing out of stores. Halfords’ sales of hybrid bikes have doubled and demand for bikes via the government’s Cycle to Work discount scheme has soared. Electric bike sales have also accelerated as older people look for an alternative to public transport or a car.Stapleton said Halfords still had bikes available and stocks were improving, but as a result of “unprecedented demand, which has been difficult to forecast” the chain had sold out of some under-£1,000 adult models, which meant “there is going to be short-term challenge with availability”.He said Halfords had considered bringing in bikes by air, but this had proved too expensive, and the company was bringing in new stock from Turkey and Europe that could arrive faster than from its usual south-east Asian sources.Several cycle retailers said stocks of cheaper adult bikes from key brands, including Trek, Specialized and Raleigh, had virtually run out across the country.Kirsty Woodcock, head of UK marketing at Specialized, said there was no shortage of bikes, just delivery delaysas a result of the increased demand, and the company was working extra shifts at its UK warehouse to get more bikes out on the road.There are also concerns about supplies of some cycle parts as a result of the demand to repair older bikes.“There is most definitely a problem facing the trade at the moment and that’s supply issues,” said Paul Walker, owner of cycle parts and accessories distributor Hykeham Wholesale based in Lincoln.“It’s gone absolutely crazy. I have done three months of sales in a month. It was really unexpected. It looks like this month will be similar – or it would be if I still had stocks to sell,” said Walker.But cycle retailers are unsure if the frenzy of interest will be a blip that could be wiped out as supplies of bikes dwindle over the summer and drivers return to their cars.Hopes for lasting change in the UK got a boost when the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, unveiled a £2bn package “to put cycling and walking at the heart of our transport policy”. Transport for London has also unveiled plans for cycle-only roads and bridges in the capital to help Londoners avoid public transport.The government has also said it will issue vouchers for hundreds of thousands of cycle repairs to help get an estimated 7m unused bicycles in the UK out of the shed. The Bicycle Association is hoping the UK will follow France’s example with vouchers worth £50 per person launching next month.Stapleton said he thought the cycle boom would not trickle away: “I think some of this will continue. People need bikes to get to work because there isn’t any other option.”Most companies of any size now offer this as a staff benefit. Employees who sign up are given a voucher which they take down to their local bike shop and use it to buy their chosen bicycle, plus other items such as lights or clothing.The savings come through the fact that staff do not pay income tax or national insurance on the purchase price. In reality, your employer actually buys a bike for you, and you “hire” it back making a monthly payments from your gross (pre-tax) salary – typically over four years. Basic rate taxpayers – earning less than £50,000 a year – save a quarter on the bike and accessories’ cost. Higher rate taxpayers save even more.Someone opting to buy a £500 commuting bike, a lock, a helmet and a waterproof jacket – spending £600 in total, would see their wages fall by around £34 a month for a year. That assumes they earn £30,000 a year. In total, they would save £150 over a normal purchase. A higher rate taxpayer would save £210 over the upfront £600 purchase.Originally, there was a £1,000 limit on bike-scheme purchases, but this was scrapped to allow users to buy more expensive models."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c74cbd9958d0d5173954a1eb8329d0c3fd345a8/61_644_1446_867/master/1446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5abf0fd7cb1f9f60795305456b6c23","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e457b4bb6489ede39631021c6a84d48a899246ea/0_0_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8647e89f63aa5df5840a7dabc5a8fc15","title":"best way composting council food waste","story":"My local council has stopped collecting food waste and I’m not sure what I need to compost itEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.My local council has stopped collecting food waste and I think I need to start composting.

The sad news is that that means staying away. This time the best thing is to ring her, video-call her or Skype her – but avoid any unnecessary physical contact or proximity.”The following day Johnson imposed a full lockdown on the country. Pubs and restaurants had to close. Johnson banned all but essential travel. The message was crystal clear, and was repeated day after day by government ministers. It was to stay at home wherever possible, however painful and difficult doing so might seem.For weeks beforehand, those suffering symptoms of coronavirus had been ordered to self-isolate, as had anyone with whom they had come into contact. The police had been given powers to impose fines on those flouting the rules. Adults up and down the country stayed away from their parents and grandparents, however old and vulnerable they were. Lockdown was a national sacrifice that had to be made – by everyone.Yet some time the following weekend – 2829 March – Johnson’s closest adviser Dominic Cummings, his wife Mary Wakefield, a journalist who was already suffering from Covid-19 symptoms, and their young child, drove more than 250 miles from their London home to the farm where Cummings’s parents live near Durham. Over that weekend Cummings also developed symptoms and became very ill.Without revealing their location and that they had ever left London, Wakefield would later give an account of her husband’s Covid-19 experience in an article for the Spectator. “Dom couldn’t get out of bed. Day in, day out for 10 days he lay doggo with a high fever and spasms.” Cummings wrote of his illness too saying: “At the end of March and for the first two weeks of April I was ill, so we were both shut in together.” Wakefield recalled that when they had both shaken off the virus “we emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown” – a statement her readers could have been forgiven for thinking meant they had never left the capital at all.Late on Friday evening, however, people learned otherwise when the  and Daily Mirror jointly broke the story of the Cummings family’s trip north at the height of the lockdown. Durham police said they were made aware that Cummings had travelled from London and was in the area on 31 March. In a statement last night they said: “At the request of Mr Cummings’s father, an officer made contact the following morning by telephone.“During that conversation, Mr Cummings’s father confirmed that his son had travelled with his family from London to the North-East and was self-isolating in part of the property.“Durham Constabulary deemed that no further action was required. However, the officer did provide advice in relation to security issues.”A neighbour told the papers of the sighting. “I got the shock of my life, as I looked over to the gates and saw him. I recognised Dominic Cummings – he’s a very distinctive figure.”Similar examples of public officials flouting lockdown guidelines have led to swift resignations with senior Conservatives leading choruses of condemnation. When Professor Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist, quit as a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) after admitting he had been visited by his girlfriend, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was “speechless” and made much of his willingness to help the police with any inquiries they might make.But this time if Conservative ministers, MPs and No 10 staff were shocked they tried their damnedest not to show it. They took time marshalling defensive lines to save the most powerful and feared man in Whitehall, after Johnson himself. For 14 hours after the revelations caused a storm on social media the government machine seemed stunned into silence. Only a few “friends” of Cummings tried to fight back with anonymous comments. Cummings himself can normally spin his way quickly out of the tightest of corners but even he was slow to react.By mid-morning on Saturday, however, as calls grew from opposition MPs for him to quit, No 10 began its fightback. No, he would not resign under any circumstances. In fact the message was more that what Cummings had done deserved respect, and was well within the rules. Officials highlighted a part of government lockdown advice which said people could leave home in exceptional circumstances including to “provide care or help for a vulnerable person” – while failing to mention all the other parts which suggested they should have stayed put with their child. The evolving defensive argument was that Cummings’s child had needed to be cared for as the parents were suffering or about to suffer from Covid-19.With Labour demanding an urgent statement and clarity, the cabinet suddenly began to sing with one voice and rallied round Johnson’s man. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove, who used to employ Cummings and defends him at every turn, spoke out suggesting those who questioned the controversial adviser were the unthoughtful ones: “Caring for your wife and child is not a crime,” he said. Fellow senior cabinet colleagues, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, also weighed in in harmony. “Taking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t,” Sunak tweeted.The script was now decided and No 10 issued a statement saying: “Owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.“His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed.“His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside.“At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported.“His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.”But privately many Tory MPs and ministers were dismayed. The police, while cautious in public, were in private clearly furious. Scientists were incredulous and civil servants confided fears that Cummings was completely out of control. One senior mandarin said the cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill should investigate whether Cummings had breached the civil service code by so clearly going against the spirit of government policy, at a time of and on a matter of, national emergency. “Someone should be asking if Cummings’s behaviour was consistent with the civil service code, and if not what are they going to do about it?” said the civil servant.Durham’s acting police and crime commissioner, Steve White, whose force’s account of events was being challenged by No 10, said: “Given the whole ethos of the guidance and regulations issued from the government was to reduce the spread, regardless of reason, by travelling to County Durham when known to be infected was most unwise.”University College London professor Susan Michie, a member of Sage, told Sky News there was no question that what Cummings had done broke the guidance. “It appears that three rules have been broken. One is leaving the house when you’re symptomatic, another is travelling far distances and staying overnight elsewhere, and the third is having a person – in this case a child – go from one household to another household. The problem about having different rules for different people is that it breaks the trust of the people in those who are issuing the guidelines.”Dean Burnett of Cardiff University took a similar view. “What Dominic Cummings did was utterly reckless. He knew he could have been infected with Covid-19, yet he drove more than 200 miles to his parents’ house. They are in their 70s, the most vulnerable group. It is utterly bewildering.“This is a man who is on the Sage committee and who is influencing government policy on Covid-19 and he behaves like this. It is unacceptable. He should resign.”Burnett added that his own father had died of Covid-19 but he had still respected the rules of lockdown. “I could not comfort my father as he died and have had to grieve for him on my own. Like the rest of my family, I respected the rules of lockdown. Yet the man who has had key influence in setting up those rules seems to be quite happy to ignore them when it suits him. It is infuriating.”In an attempt to turn the heat on to Johnson himself Labour also demanded to know who in Downing Street had known about Cummings’s progress to the north, after officials said several people in No 10 had been aware he had left London, though none had said so before yesterday.Last night as new claims emerged in the Observer about further sightings of Cummings in different locations near Durham, it is clear the prime minister and Tory ministers are united in trying to defend him and keep him in post come what may.But while it would be a humiliation and a severe embarrassment for Johnson to lose Cummings, there are big dangers in keeping him too. This weekend the police are trying to manage expected bank holiday crowds at a time when many people already believe the lockdown is effectively over. They are in danger of losing the battle as their authority has been undermined.Asked whether Cummings’s actions would make the work of officers harder, Dorset crime commissioner Martyn Underhill said: “I’m sure inevitably it will be today, because this is a breaking story and he is a very high-profile person. It is very unfortunate the timing of this, because this is going to be the busiest weekend Dorset’s seen this year in a policing sense and a tourist sense.”More broadly there is a prospect that the whole episode will erode trust in the government, which is already on the slide, and lead people simply to ignore rules they see being flouted or bent by those at the top.The government has opted to try to stand by Cummings. But as it faces the increasingly difficult challenge of attempting to ease the lockdown with more nuanced and complex messages, it will need the public’s support to do so.Nick Baines, the bishop of Leeds, told the Observer that if there was seen to be one rule for those in power and another for the rest then the trust on which leadership depends would be lost.“People across the country have sacrificed hugely in order to obey both the spirit and word of government advice. People have missed being with family members who have died,” he said. “But now we learn that there is one rule for the people and another for No 10 and the elite. Ministers have clearly been told to tweet support for Cummings. What price conscience? Or integrity? Or credibility? Or competence at a time when leadership can only be rooted in trust?”In a crisis such as the one the country is currently enduring, the last thing any government wants is to no longer be believed by the people it represents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0c80b822173e688a40797ec7bd6d86d421924e/0_218_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=182fdc36d01a8b6c4f4426cead3521a6","title":"new witnesses cast doubt on dominic cummingss lockdown claims","story":"Exclusive: eyewitness says top No 10 aide left isolation to go 30 miles to popular tourist townDevastating new claims have emerged that Dominic Cummings further breached the lockdown rules, as Downing Street came under sustained pressure to fire the prime minister’s most senior adviser.The new testimony suggests Cummings left the home where he was staying in Durham to visit a town 30 miles away on 12 April.He was allegedly spotted back in Durham on 19 April, days after he was photographed in London having recovered from the virus, suggesting that following his first trip across the country at the end of March he had made a second journey from the capital to north-east England. At the time, with the UK at the peak of the pandemic, the government was insisting that people should be staying at home.As Cummings faced calls to resign from across the political spectrum, the government was forced to defend his actions.Ministers insisted he had stayed put once arriving at a property in Durham, where he had travelled after contracting the symptoms of coronavirus to seek the support from his extended family.But the new claims would appear to demolish this defence and intensify questions over his claim that going there was permitted because he needed childcare while he was sick.The new accounts raise fresh questions about his insistence that the initial 264-mile trip to Durham was justified, and led to a new round of calls for the spin doctor to quit. The two new witnesses were revealed in a joint investigation by the Observer and the Sunday Mirror. One saw him in Durham on 19 April, days after Cummings was photographed in London having recovered from the virus.A week earlier Cummings was seen by another witness in Barnard Castle on Easter Day, 30 miles away from Durham, the investigation found. The town, which takes its name from the English Heritage site at its centre, is a popular destination for days out.Robin Lees, 70, a retired chemistry teacher from the town, says he saw Cummings and his family walking by the Tees before getting into a car around lunchtime on 12 April.Lees said: “I was a bit gobsmacked to see him, because I know what he looks like. And the rest of the family seemed to match – a wife and child. I was pretty convinced it was him and it didn’t seem right because I assumed he would be in London.”He added: “I went home and told my wife, we thought he must be in London. I searched up the number plate later that day and my computer search history shows that.”“They didn’t do anything nearly as irresponsible as Cummings. You don’t take the virus from one part of the country to another. It just beggars belief to think you could actually drive when the advice was stay home, save lives. It couldn’t have been clearer.”When Cummings was apparently recognised a second time on 19 April, he was wearing his trademark beanie hat, and was heard commenting on how “lovely” the bluebells were during an early morning Sunday stroll with his wife Mary Wakefield.The second eyewitness, who declined to be named, said: “We were shocked and surprised to see him because the last time we did was earlier in the week in Downing Street.”Cummings had been photographed on 14 April in Downing Street, the first time he had been seen back at work since recovering from the virus.“We thought: ‘He’s not supposed to be here during the lockdown,’” the source said.“We thought: ‘What double standards, one rule for him as a senior adviser to the prime minister and another for the rest of us.’”At Saturday’s daily Downing Street press conference, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said Cummings’s actions, first revealed by the  and Daily Mirror, were acceptable because he and his family had remained in isolation after arriving at the property in Durham, rather than travelling away from the property.“The decision here was to go to that location and stay in that location,” he said. “They didn’t then move around from there.”The deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, said the aim of the advice on self-isolation was to remain “out of circulation”.Shapps said that the prime minister gave Cummings his full support. He added that he did not know when Boris Johnson became aware of the circumstances of Cummings’s decision to go to Durham.Asked whether Cummings’s claim that the police had not spoken to his family, despite an official statement to the contrary, meant that Durham constabulary were lying, he said that he was “not sure where the confusion in that comes in”. Durham police are standing by their statement issued on Friday that the Cummings family was reminded of the lockdown rules on 31 March, after he was seen in the area.Downing Street has also been accused of a cover-up after initial reports that some in No 10 knew Cummings had made the journey.Labour, the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats have written to the head of the civil service, Sir Mark Sedwill, demanding an inquiry into what happened. The latest claims led to fresh calls on Saturday night for Cummings to resign.The SNP’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, called on the cabinet secretary to investigate the “rule-breaking and the Tory government’s cover-up” of Cummings’s journey to Durham.Acting Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: “If Dominic Cummings is now allowed to remain in place a moment longer, it will increasingly be the prime minister’s judgment that is in the spotlight.” Meanwhile, the cabinet’s most senior ministers were accused of placing political loyalty over public health, after they launched an orchestrated battle to defend Cummings. Michael Gove, Matt Hancock, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak were among those to defend the spin doctor.“We need an urgent investigation by the cabinet secretary to get to the bottom of this matter. It cannot be right that there is one rule for the prime minister’s adviser and another for the British people.” Police warned that the allegations came at a crucial moment in the lockdown, with officers attempting to enforce the rules during a sunny bank holiday. George Peretz QC, a public law barrister, also suggested Cummings could have breached laws put in place to enforce the lockdown.Downing Street declined to comment on the new claims before publication."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5434ef51c629d539d2c9150f1ece56c9eac050fd/1900_373_4116_2469/master/4116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ada71930cedf95a93f249668e58745","title":"the science of making sourdough bread","story":"The transformation of dough into a loaf is chemistry in action. With a bit of physics and microbiology. And love…If bread is rising, sourdough is soaring. Along with pasta and toilet rolls, flour was among the first products to vanish from supermarket shelves and Covid-19 inspired a home-baking boom. While Google searches for “bread” tripled in the UK in the weeks after mid-March, those for “sourdough” rose sixfold. Sourdough differs from most bread in that it contains no baker’s yeast, relying instead on a fermented “starter” of water and flour to provide lift. This also provides its sour flavour and chewy texture.However, many sourdough newbies have found that producing beautiful, tasty loaves isn’t as easy as it looks on social media. Maybe it’s time for a new approach. The transformation of dough into a light and airy loaf is, after all, chemistry in action, with a good side of physics. The complex relationships between the yeasts and bacteria that power starter fermentation are the domain of the microbiologist. Whether you’re a beginner left holding bricks that taste of dough, or an accomplished amateur looking to further up your game, perhaps what you need is a refresher in the science of sourdough.To replace the baker’s yeast that most breads need to rise, sourdough requires some starter – a self-sustaining fermentation of flour, water, wild yeasts and bacteria that produce lactic and acetic acids. You might be able to get some starter from a local baker, or you can make your own – by combining small equal quantities of water and flour and letting it ferment for around five days.Once you have established a starter you need to feed and maintain it with additional flour and water. All-purpose, refined wheat flour can be used. Most enthusiasts prefer stoneground wholegrain flours because they contain more of the microbes and enzymes needed to drive fermentation. They can, however, make a starter higher maintenance, requiring precise timing of feeding. Many opt for a more forgiving rye flour-based starter, and some use flour blends.“When I fed our starter sifted bread and whole wheat flours, it would ebb and flow in health, activity and consistency,” says San Francisco baker Josey Baker (yes, that’s his real name). “I’ve had the best luck with wholegrain rye flour, which seemed to stabilise it in a way that has worked very well for us for years.” An underperforming wheat flour starter that has lost its vigour can be pepped up with a rye flour boost. Some mix in extras like grapes or yoghurt, though this isn’t necessary if you’re using good flour.Rye-based starters attract more heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, which produce vinegary acetic acid and give bread sour, fruity flavours. Wheat flours encourage homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, which only produce lactic acid, making for softer, cereal flavours, while wholewheat adds a malty, nutty taste.Use of more water and warm weather encourages microbes that will generate a sweeter-tasting loaf. To add sourness, rest your dough in the fridge, possibly overnight, as lower temperatures favour the activity of bacteria that produce acetic acid.Some bakers in San Francisco, which is famous for its sourdough, swear their loaves can’t be produced elsewhere. There is a species of lactic acid bacteria called Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, which produces a characteristically sour flavour, although it has been found in sourdoughs across the world.Scientists at North Carolina State University (NCSU) used DNA sequencing to identify the microbes in starters sent to them by more than 500 participants in their Global Sourdough Project. “We found there is incredible ersity across different sourdoughs, even those from the same neighbourhoods,” says microbiologist Dr Anne Madden, of NCSU. In a follow-up study, the team asked 18 bakers from 14 countries to make starters using the same flour and method, and then assembled them in Belgium to make bread. The microbes in their starters were most similar to those in the flour they used, but were also reflected in those found on the bakers’ hands. “This suggests an intimate relationship,” says Madden. “Either the hands are adding microbes to the starters or the starters are adding microbes to the hands.” The group hope to find out more through the Wild Sourdough Project, launched in April, in which they are asking citizen scientists to make starters and record their characteristics.It depends whether you need your bread by lunchtime. Despite much talk to the contrary, there is no gluten in dry flour. Rather, it contains proteins called gliadin and glutenin, which, once hydrated, combine to form gluten, which can absorb twice its weight in water. It is also sticky, stretchy and elastic. The strength and structure of a good loaf rests on a scaffolding of fine strands of gluten. “Your gluten network acts like a balloon that keeps the gas produced by the yeast inside,” says Karl De Smedt, who runs a library of sourdoughs in St Vith, Belgium. The collection currently maintains 128 sourdoughs from 25 countries, some of which date back to the 19th century. “Without a good gluten network your bread cannot rise and you will end up with a brick,” adds De Smedt.Kneading adds energy and oxygen to dough, speeding the development of the gluten, allowing speedier baking. In “no knead” recipes, edges of the dough are stretched and folded back in, and then left to develop. This process is repeated several times, before the dough is left to swell for a longer period. “You only need to knead if you want to be quick,” says Kimbell. “But if you give your dough a proper, vigorous mix, you can also let the gluten develop during a long, slow fermentation.”The water content of your dough is also key. Beginners often slop in too much too quickly and then panic when their dough becomes gloopy and so throw in extra flour. Kimbell’s top tip is to start with about three-quarters of the water in your recipe, mix slowly and add splashes as you go. Greater water content makes for softer dough and bigger bubbles. “It is easier to blow up a balloon with thin skin than one with thick skin, and by adding more water your dough becomes more like a thin balloon,” says De Smedt.If you want larger air pockets, be gentle when handling your dough, otherwise you’ll knock out the gas needed to make them. But while big holes make for nice Instagram pictures, some focus on structure at the expense of more important attributes. “Any fool can make big holes once they understand gluten and water,” says Kimbell. “The true art is in creating something that is complex, soft, tender, nourishing with both sweetness and light sourness.”Sugars and amino acids on the loaf’s surface start to react at about 150C in the Maillard reaction, a process that gives seared foods a distinctive taste and colouring. Add steam into the oven and it will condense on the cold surface of your loaf and delay crust formation. Keeping the bread’s surface flexible for longer allows for a final burst of fermentation and gas bubble production, while also allowing existing bubbles to expand. It allows the loaf to stretch so that it becomes light and airy. Many cook their sourdough in a Dutch oven or under a cloche to trap water vapour from the dough and create steam.The lactic acids in sourdough neutralise phytates in flour that when consumed in large amounts can prevent the body absorbing minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc in bread. They also slow the release of glucose into the bloodstream, lowering the bread’s glycemic index and preventing insulin spikes. The lactic acids also make gluten more digestible, and reduce the chances of gluten intolerance. A study published in December by Prof Marco Gobbetti, of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, in Italy, found sourdough to be more digestible than bread made with baker’s yeast. Sourdough fermented for longer periods made healthy iniduals feel more full more quickly, and those who ate sourdough had higher amino acid concentrations in their blood.That depends who is making it. De Smedt believes it is best approached as a science. Josey Baker believes that to do it properly requires both perspectives. “Ultimately bread is made, not in labs but in homes and bakeries, by people with subjective opinions using their skills, intuitions, emotions and other intangibles that science doesn’t attempt to address,” he says. “If you’re trying to make bread relying only on one or the other, then you’re leaving something important out.”Kimbell agrees that while science can point bakers in the right direction, there’s much more to making a great sourdough loaf than manipulating variables based on data analysis. “You can totally geek out on the amazing science of the microbial fermentation process,” she says. “Or you can slow down, lose yourself in the moment and fall in love with it. You use your hands, your heart and your mind to get to know the dough, feel it, understand it, and sense what it needs. The only other time you get to connect like that is, let’s be honest, when you meet a new lover.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0748119492880663b2787ec8c35aa95af20337/0_0_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ccc933f3d8faabd789a99f0071c9688","title":"young people tell us how rising unemployment rates are affecting you","story":"As unemployment rates skyrocket in the UK, we’d like to hear from those under 25 who have lost jobs, or are struggling to get work, due to coronavirusYoung people, who often have less experience in employment and applications, are likely to be one of the most affected groups.We’d like to hear from those under 25 who have been made unemployed, or are struggling to get a job, due to coronavirus.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

It’s actually rubbish. Here’s why. No wait, come back! This isn’t that. Although, as it happens, there has been a background drip of this kind of thing around The Last Dance, the blockbusting Netflix series documenting the incredible untold story of Michael Jordan winning at basketball while people tell him he’s great and he pretends to be nice.Come back again! Just a joke! But this has been a real-world subplot to the success of The Last Dance, a public response that has veered between unconditional reverence, to a kind of culture-wars inventory of the personal politics of the film’s star. As the final episodes aired this week there was a minor chorus of Chicago Bulls teammates dismayed at their own portrayal as extras, plot devices in the Jordan Supremacy.As a long-distance fan it has been fascinating to watch this play out. Partly this is wrapped up in the simple pleasure of observing a certain type of high-grade, tearfully earnest American sports journalist address their subject, the kind of American journalist who talks about sport as though it’s a cross between the moon landings and a childhood trauma on a fishing trip.Add to this reverent tone the fact that Jordan is also a cultural icon, that to offer even tempered praise is to take a stance against a certain kind of orthodoxy. That thing you like: it’s complicated.Two main questions have cropped up. The first is the issue raised this week by former teammate Horace Grant, and indeed, sotto voce, by the film itself. Is Michael Jordan actually a hypercompetitive sociopath? Is the greatest athlete in modern American sport some kind of superstar bully?And secondly, is this actually a documentary film at all, given Jordan’s editorial control, or just a hugely enjoyable advert for shoes?First up, it is worth stating the obvious. The Last Dance is a sensationally good sports film whatever the answers to these questions. The storytelling is thrillingly detailed, and performative too. The beauty of basketball lies in its interlocking details, the way players, skills, tactics and backstories elide in a snapshot, creating that dizzyingly rich athletic ballet. This is what the series gives you: a lavish, beautifully constructed courtside seat. It is, whatever else, a love letter to its sport.It is easy to get carried away by this richness. As it progressed I found myself consumed with affection for assorted New Favourite Guys among the relentlessly charismatic array of former players. First up there’s Scottie Pippen, the heart of the film, who has something irresistibly stern and upright about him and who is said to be disappointed, no doubt in that weary frontier-preacher kind of way, by his own portrayal.Then there’s mild, steely Steve Kerr, who looks like a small-town orthodontist but appears also to be one of the nicest hypercompetitive athletes to have walked the earth. And obviously there’s Dennis Rodman just for the sheer luminous glory, the perfect blend of hard-headed elite dedication and going to the wrestling and pretending to hit someone with a chair.In fact I wanted to be friends with all of them. All except Michael. I wanted Michael to distrust me, to hate me but finally, and through gritted teeth, to admit that he grudgingly respects me.Admittedly, this probably won’t end up happening. But it does lead us back to that first question. Is Jordan, the man-turned-logo, the inspiration to millions, actually a bit of a dick? The answer is obvious. Yes he is! But it doesn’t matter. In fact this is in many ways the best part of the film. And let’s be clear, Jordan is a wonderful dick. He’s fantastic at it. At one point Reggie Miller recalls, with awed amusement, playing Jordan in his rookie year. Miller gets turned over in the final quarter. As they walk off Jordan tells him: “Don’t ever talk trash to black Jesus.”Later Jordan punches small, kindly Steve (“I hit him right in the fucking eye”), wants to apologise, doesn’t actually have his teammate’s number, but finally convinces Steve that he, Michael, is actually cool with it all so basically STFU. “From that point on our relationship dramatically improved,” Steve confirms.There are moments where some merely-very-good pro basketball player talks about a defining moment in his life, the one game where he made some small mark on greatness. Mike is shown watching on a tablet, hooting and laughing. Towards the end someone poisons him with a doctored pizza and you think, yeah, well, OK.But again, this is fine. This is what being relentlessly great at sport sometimes looks like. It may sit poorly with the urge to lionise and fan-worship, but plenty of elite sportspeople have something wild about them: the sharp, obsessive edge that drives you to become this astonishingly good at something so reductively simple. It just happens Jordan has the once-in-a-lifetime talent and drive to live this personality to its fullest expression. There are no restraints, no boundaries as long as you keep winning. How are we expecting him to come across at the end of this?The interesting point here is how this feeds into question two. This isn’t really a documentary, or a work of journalism. It’s a hagiography. It was always meant to be. Jordan is sport’s most valuable brand. His company made the film. That thing you like: it’s also an advert.But even this works. The bits where Jordan tells us things in spite of himself are also the best parts. The hero of this film is a sporting genius, but he’s also an unreliable narrator, a narrator who gives away more than you expect.These glimpses of how it might feel to be caught in the glow of all that excess brilliance are what makes The Last Dance not just spectacular, but a version of some other truth that still seems to be playing itself out now.

Ask him whether players can expect the Premiership’s eventual return to be close to what went before and he is likewise outspoken. “When we resume playing, there will be a new normal regarding costs and personnel is part of that: nothing is off the table.”Vaughan is not alone among the chief executives of Premiership clubs in regarding the current sporting lockdown as an opportunity to reset businesses that have tended over the years to be guided by dreams rather than reality and relied on the largesse of owners and backers. Vaughan says: “We would love to think that things will go back to where they were, but clearly there will be an impact. You want to do the best you can for the excellent people we have here and that keeps you awake at night.”Wasps, like the other Premiership clubs, have cut wages for players and furloughed staff. The clubs hope to restart at the beginning of July and play the campaign to its conclusion to ensure they do not have to pay rebates to broadcasters, but they are waiting for clearance from the government to resume full training early next month.“Whatever we do next, we have to be up front with the players,” says Vaughan, “and engage with the Rugby Players’ Association, a force of good: they have the players’ interests at heart but they are very sensible. They understand life has changed. We have very little revenue coming in and we are spending considerable time looking at parts of the business, including the playing side, and how we can be more efficient when we are able to open the doors again. We have talked to the players and coaches about what it will look like and they have not held back in their views.”Similar conversations have been held throughout the Premiership in recent weeks, which is why many clubs were angry when Bristol broke ranks this week when they said they would oppose the recommendation of Lord Myners, in his recent report on the salary cap regulations, that the provision for two marquee players outside the cap should be reviewed, as well as any attempt to lower the cap from its current £7m, which has another season to run.“Every club is entitled to its opinion,” says Vaughan, who this week became the group chief executive, adding the portfolio of events at the Ricoh Arena to the fields of sport, marketing and commerce that he had been in charge of since August after seven years at Gloucester. “Bristol’s vision is to win league titles and Europe and if they have the money to back it up, their strategy will not be cutting the salary cap. You will always get a couple of outliers with rich backers but the majority of clubs have a really sensible approach.“The pandemic has shone a light on the unsustainability clubs were at already and the majority neither want nor will be able to continue to operate in the new world in the same way we did then. We believe a collective approach is better than everyone doing their own thing: one of the Premiership’s objectives is to have a competitive league and it is because each club is paying within a few shillings of its rivals.”Vaughan sympathises with Bristol who, after years in the Championship, have the means to tilt at the big time. “It is not their fault they have an owner in the rich list and wants great things for the club he loves. I have no malice with them, but it will sit differently with those who may not think it is in the spirit of what we are trying to achieve during this pandemic. Collective action is sensible in the light of the hole in revenue every club will face. We support Lord Myners’s recommendations and his report was a powerful piece of work.“When he says we should look at whether marquee players are adding to the value of the game or creating a disparity within the business, we should do. I do not share Bristol’s belief that marquee players add to the gate when they are playing away.“When I was at Gloucester, we always struggled to sell tickets for Saracens despite the number of unbelievable players they had. It is not like George Best turning up in town. I understand Bristol’s ambition, but for the Premiership as a whole survival at this point is the ambition.”Wasps have the highest turnover in the Premiership, £32m, but the entire business has been hit by the restrictions on gatherings, from rugby to conferencing, exhibitions and concerts. “The Killers and Rammstein were due to perform at the Ricoh Arena this summer, but they have postponed until next year. The business was growing and we were having a record year in terms of events and conferences while the priority on the field has changed since the club first moved to Coventry.“We have a clear strategy to become a club where players stay because of the culture. We do not want to buy in superstars every year to fill a gap. Yes, you need quality players, but we do not want to be known as a cheque-book club, rather one that punches above its weight in the top four.“These are the most challenging times all of us have known, but I believe that if we stick together, we will all emerge from it stronger.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fcb3a070453588adbd50237e204fb49c4f47416/21_1148_4276_2566/master/4276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecba7f73659f884770996aced49f4686","title":"lockdown laptops affordable options for those stuck at home","story":"With a full return to work and social life still some way off, you may need a new computerWith a full return to work, school and spending time with family in real life rather than on a video call still not in sight, you may have finally decided that it is worth buying a new laptop. If you want an affordable computer there are lots to choose from, including Chromebooks and Windows 10 PCs.Really cheap Chromebooks are often better than the equivalent Windows machines because Chrome OS is a lighter, low-maintenance operating system built around Google’s Chrome browser, web and Android apps. Just check how long the machine will receive updates from Google before you buy.If you need certain desktop software, though, such as Photoshop, Windows PCs might be a better option. Here are my picks for five of the best options for £500 and under.One of the cheapest new Chromebooks, the Lenovo C340-11 offers a lot of bang for the buck.For £270 you get a metal lid but a plastic body with a fairly solid construction coming in at 1.18kg and 17.9mm thick.The small 11.6in 720p HD touchscreen is a bit dull and low resolution but fine enough at this price. The machine is a convertible, meaning the screen folds all the way over to the back to turn it into a tablet.The keyboard is OK, but a little mushy and loud, while the trackpad is a little small but fairly good, as cheap computers go.The processor is the common low-performance Intel Celeron N4000 and it has 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, plus a microSD card slot for adding more. Two standard USB-A ports, two USB-C ports and a headphone socket round out the body. It supports the older wifi ac and Bluetooth 4.2 standards.The performance is nothing to shout about but it will manage everyday computing and playing a video just fine.The 720p webcam is a bit rubbish and the speakers are pretty quiet. The battery lasts for about 10 hours. The Lenovo C340-11 will receive Chrome OS updates until June 2026.Verdict: A bit small and underpowered but good value for such a low price and fine for light computing.Acer makes a range of good Chromebooks but if you want something a little bigger than an 11.6in screen, the premium-feeling Chromebook 514 could do the trick.The 14in Chromebook 514 comes in various versions but the 514-1HT variant has a full HD screen that is noticeably crisper and clearer than the 720p versions.The 514-1HT can be bought with an old but still capable Intel Pentium N4200 quad-core processor, 4GB of RAM and 32GB storage, which handles day-to-day computing well enough.Cheaper versions come with a slower Intel Celeron N3350 dual-core processor.The 1.5kg, 17mm-thick body is aluminium, which feels slim and solid. The backlit keyboard is fairly good and the trackpad is a good size, and smooth and responsive.Wifi ac, Bluetooth 4.2, two USB-A, two USB-C ports, a headphone socket and a microSD card reader round out connectivity options.The 720p webcam and speakers are not great, but the Chromebook should last up to about 10 hours between charges with light browsing and basic office duties.The Chromebook 514-1HT will receive updates until June 2024.A popular premium-feeling Chromebook with a decent screen and enough power to handle browsing and light work.The 15in Lenovo Chromebook C340-15 is a significant step up in all the ways that matter including price. It has a large 15.6in full HD touchscreen, which is big, even for a mainstream laptop. It has a full-size keyboard with a number pad and a large trackpad.The screen can fold all the way over to be used as a tablet, too, but at 1.96kg and 19mm thickness it would be huge.It has the usual mix of average 720p webcam and slightly more powerful speakers. However, the star of the show is a significantly more powerful eighth-generation Intel Core i3 processor, which makes most things faster, even with the standard 4GB of RAM. It also has 128GB of storage, which is large for a Chromebook.Wifi ac, Bluetooth 4.2, one USB port, two USB-C ports, a microSD card slot and a headphone socket round out the connectivity options.The Chromebook C340-15 will receive updates until June 2025.Verdict: If you want a really big screen and more powerful processor the Chromebook C340-15 ticks the box without breaking the bank.Once you are looking at spending more than £400, capable Windows PCs are often a better option than a Chromebook. My new pick of the lot is Microsoft’s new Surface Go 2, which proves lower-cost, lower-performance PCs do not have to be rubbish.The Surface Go 2 is the cheapest of Microsoft’s popular detachable tablet PCs. Your £399 buys the slim and light tablet with a great full HD 10.5in screen, great speakers, precise touchscreen, wifi 6, Bluetooth 5, a good webcam and excellent Windows Hello face recognition for logging you in. What it does not buy is a keyboard, which is a £100 essential additional purchase for anything beyond just watching Netflix – but at least it and the trackpad are excellent.Its gutsy Intel Pentium Gold 4425Y processor will not win any speed awards but will get the job done, while 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage is the bare minimum you should use with Windows 10. A £529 version has 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD but all models have a microSD card slot for cheaply adding more storage, and the modern standard USB-C port is there for connecting accessories.For a real price of £499 you can certainly find bigger, more powerful PCs but you will not find a better all-round experience. Look for deals on the original Surface Go as well, which shares most of the new model’s good qualities.Verdict: Small, light and affordable, the gutsy Surface Go 2 shows low-end Windows PCs can still be great.

Plus we wanted to write about masculinity and entitlement and it felt like football was one of the last workplaces where you deal with a particular kind of male environment.”The result is a raucous comedy that both lampoons football’s excesses – the rabid ever-complaining fans, over-the-top cars and spotless, barely inhabited mansions – and is surprisingly sympathetic to the three young men (a rising star, a youth academy graduate hoping to break through and a new American transfer not entirely sure why he’s been signed) at its centre.“They’re still idiots like the characters in The Inbetweeners but the difference is that while those characters could say almost anything because nobody cared for these guys, it’s the opposite,” says Beesley. “They’re young men making the sort of mistakes that all young men make but they don’t have the anonymity the rest of us do, so it really is sink or swim.”Aware that the show itself would sink or swim according to how accurate it appeared – “we wanted it to feel authentic as well as funny” – the duo, with the help of Matty Lawrence, the former Millwall and Crystal Palace defender, spoke to everyone from former and current players, “including high-profile internationals”, to club doctors, coaches and press officers, managers, chairmen and CEOs.“We’re not allowed to say exactly who we spoke to in case people presume certain storylines are based on them but Tom Werner, the executive producer of the show, is also the chairman of Liverpool so that’s a fairly big hint,” says Morris.It was the interviews, however, that provided the most insight into the ridiculous side of the beautiful game. “We spoke to one footballer who said that the reason footballers get married early is because kids fill up time,” says Beesley. “Before, when he was single, he hadn’t known what to do with himself but now he had two kids and it was great because he was never bored.”There were darker stories too, particularly from former footballers who were playing “during that sweet spot where the wages were good but the social media wasn’t as prevalent so they could behave like rock stars without getting caught,” says Beesley.Those stories fed into the character of Petey, the club’s aggressive King Lad, played by Theo Barklam-Biggs with all the swagger of a man who has never been told “no”. “He’s an amalgamation of all the monsters we’d heard about from older generations,” adds Morris. And while the crude jokes – from sight gags involving dog poo to a storyline revolving around toilet roll – flow as thick and fast as The Inbetweeners fans would hope for, The First Team’s real strength comes from the warmth of its central relationships.“The difference between this and previous football shows is that they’ve tended to focus on the big explosive moments like winning the league or the cup,” says Morris. “We wanted to shine a light on the small comedies of life instead. It’s not really a show about football so much as a sitcom where the characters are footballers.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47732121f3991cf416baa5d1eca4acdc15473097/57_27_1737_1042/master/1737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ad66d49518c52aa28ee011c0b1bdfce","title":"north dakota governor doug burgum tears coronavirus mask shaming","story":"Republican Doug Burgum called out ‘senseless iding line’ between Americans over whether masks should be worn in publicIn North Dakota on Friday, the Republican governor, Doug Burgum, decried a “senseless iding line” between US citizens over whether masks should be worn in public during the coronavirus pandemic.As he pleaded with citizens of his state to “try to dial up your empathy and your understanding”, Burgum was moved to the brink of tears.“We’re all in this together and there’s only one battle we’re fighting,” he said. “And that’s the battle of the virus.”As Donald Trump encourages states to reopen their battered economies, federal authorities are recommending covering the face in public when social distancing is difficult, for example in grocery stores.Some states require residents to wear masks in public settings. North Dakota, where Burgum allowed reopening to start from 1 May, does not.The president has notably refused to wear a mask in public, although he was photographed wearing one on a visit to a Ford plant in Michigan this week.On Saturday, Secret Service officers who were with the president on a trip to a golf course were pictured wearing masks. Trump was not.Some rightwing protesters have attracted publicity by refusing to wear masks, while some shopkeepers have reportedly sought to deny service to people wearing face coverings.Speaking to reporters at the state capitol in Bismarck on Friday, Bergum said he “would really love to see in North Dakota that we could just skip this thing that other parts of the nation are going through, that they’re creating a ide. Either it’s ideological or political or something around mask versus no mask.“This is I would say a senseless iding line and I would ask people to try to dial up your empathy and your understanding. If someone is wearing a mask, they’re not doing it to represent what political party they’re in or what candidates they support.”As he continued, Burgum struggled not to break down in tears.“They might be doing it because they’ve got a five-year-old who’s been going through cancer treatments,” he said.“They might have vulnerable adults in their life who currently have Covid-19 and are fighting.“So again, I would just love to see our state, as part of being ‘North Dakota smart’, also be ‘North Dakota kind’, ‘North Dakota empathetic’, ‘North Dakota understanding’, to do this thing. Because if somebody wants to wear a mask, there should be no mask shaming.”According to Johns Hopkins University, by Saturday North Dakota had recorded 2,317 coronavirus cases and 52 deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f1cc38d8e8918aaaf5cd56fdedd000e9dc61887/0_237_5421_3253/master/5421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02d2dd161a949395574ae2127d0896c2","title":"motorists urged to shun beauty spots as uk faces scorching bank holiday","story":"AA suggests government should not have eased lockdown before MondayThe AA has appealed to motorists across the UK to think twice before embarking on long journeys to beaches and beauty spots on the May bank holiday.With the Met Office forecasting that temperatures in some parts of Britain could rise to more than 26C on Monday, the AA suggested the government should have considered not easing the lockdown until afterwards.Councils and some of those involved in tourism also called on the public to avoid swamping coastal resorts this Monday while the pandemic continues.Edmund King, the AA’s president, said: “Whilst understanding the frustrations of the police and locals, it is obviously difficult for iniduals to know how busy an area would be until they get there. In order to take pressure off picturesque coastal and rural areas it would be helpful to clarify the rules rather than condemn the drivers.“Perhaps the government should have delayed easing leisure trips until after the bank holiday to avoid this situation, but drivers should also think about how far they need to travel to enjoy the great outdoors safely. Many facilities, such as shops and public toilets, will not be open at traditional holiday hotspots.”King said drivers should plan their journeys in advance this weekend and “if it is busy, hotspots should be avoided”.One hotspot is expected to be Brighton, where the city council advised would-be visitors from outside the area not to travel there this weekend.Stewards were deployed on Friday to restrict access to Brighton beach from East Street to West Street. The council said the stewards would be in place from noon to 9pm up to and including bank holiday Monday “to encourage physical distancing and direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if the area becomes too busy”.The council added: “We are used to catering for up to 11 million visitors each year and are renowned for the warm welcome we usually give to all our valued visitors.“We are so proud of the city we share but to promote Brighton and Hove as a place to visit at this time would be utterly irresponsible and an insult to the NHS staff and frontline workers who have protected the whole county throughout this devastating crisis.”Not everyone on Brighton beach agrees with the continued lockdown of most businesses.Luke Johnson, the chairman of the Brighton Pier Group PLC, said 900 of its staff were desperate to return to their jobs.“We would love to reopen this weekend but we can’t, we are trapped. But in the longer term, with millions of Brits unable or unwilling to travel abroad this summer staycation could be the salvation of this city. Brighton will have to get to a situation where we are encouraging instead of dissuading people to come to visit us,” Johnson said.Blackpool has already experienced an increase in visitors to attractions such as Stanley Park, the resort’s 26-acre green space.Elaine Smith, the chairman of Friends of Stanley Park, said it was too early for the Lancashire resort to absorb a mass influx of tourists.“We should pray for rain not just to keep the numbers down but also because we’ve just spent £4,000 on our rose garden and at this stage we really would need some rain for them too,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

For the moment, however, Mexican archaeologists are facing a surfeit of mammoths, almost too many to ever excavate.“There are too many, there are hundreds,” said archaeologist Pedro Sánchez Nava, of the National Institute of Anthropology and History.The institute began digging in three large but shallow areas in October, when work started to convert an old military airbase into a civilian airport. In about six months, the bones of 60 of the huge, extinct herbivores were found, and Sánchez Nava said that pace – about 10 mammoths a month – may continue. The airport project is scheduled for completion in 2022, at which the dig will end.The excavations were conducted on the shores of an ancient lake, once known as Xaltocan and now disappeared. The shallow lake apparently produced generous quantities of grasses and reeds, which attracted mammoths who often ate 150kg (330lb) of the stuff every day. “It was like paradise for them,” Sánchez Nava said.The excavations are about six miles (10km) away from the mammoth pits found last year in the hamlet of San Antonio Xahuento, There, two human-built pits were dug about 15,000 years ago to trap mammoths, which apparently couldn’t clamber out of the 6ft (2-meter) deep traps.Those pits, found during excavations for a garbage dump, were filled with bones from at least 14 mammoths, and some of the animals appeared to have been butchered.The institute said hunters may have chased mammoths into the traps. Remains of two other species that later disappeared in the Americas – a horse and a camel – were also found in the sediments, at layers corresponding to 15,000 to 20,000 years ago.The newer excavations at the airbase have not yet turned up any of the distinct cut marks that would suggest human butchering of the animals.Sánchez Nava said the most recently discovered mammoths had apparently got stuck in the mud of the ancient lake and died, or were eaten by other animals.But, he said, ancient humans could possibly have used the mud pools and flats around the lake shore as a sort of natural trap. “It’s possible they may have chased them into the mud,” he said.The huge number of mammoths being discovered may also change scientists’ views of how frequently mammoth turned up on the dinner menu of our ancestors. “They used to think it was very chance, sporadic,” Sánchez Nava said of a mammoth meal. “In fact, it may have been part of their daily diet.”Mammoth bones have always been so numerous in the area that the Aztecs, who ruled the Mexico Valley between 1325 and 1521, recorded having found the enormous bones Sánchez Nava said the Aztecs interpreted them as proof of legends that giants had once populated the valley.Sánchez Nava said nothing had been found that would require halting work on the airport project, in which the old military base is being converted into a civilian terminal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60dd565dceae12670dc127e5d776a783900b0b1f/0_432_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c280c25a886d0cc7833e64e68977d60","title":"america coronavirus covid 19 second wave","story":"Covid-19 deaths are still rising, but there are signs of quarantine fatigue – and experts warn relaxing the rules too soon could have devastating consequencesMonday is Memorial Day – the traditional start of the American summer. Shutters are going up, doors are being unlocked, barriers removed. Every state is relaxing quarantine rules to some extent, betting that the country finally has Covid-19 under control.There are signs that for some Americans quarantine fatigue is overcoming fear of infection. With the economy reeling, others have dismissed the pandemic as a political plot – for them relaxing quarantine rules can’t come soon enough. But people on the front line are worried, and experts warn the outbreak has proved a “trust-destroying disaster” that could have devastating consequences.On Friday, White House coronavirus taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci said new localized outbreaks were “inevitable” as mitigation measures are relaxed. He said a full-blown second wave could be avoided if the holy grail of containment measures – testing, quarantine and contact tracing – continued to be adhered to. Fauci said he was hopeful that the US would be ready, though a recent study by Harvard University found that only nine states were conducting, or near to conducting, the minimum recommended testing. Hours after Fauci spoke, Donald Trump ignored health guidance and ordered houses of worship to open for in-person services at the weekend.These disparate responses to the pandemic are not just happening in the White House, but across America.After 51 days on lockdown, Minnesota ended its statewide stay-at-home order on Monday. A new order, dubbed Stay Safe MN, will allow more flexibility and social interaction amid the pandemic.For nurses in Minneapolis, it’s too soon. In emotional testimony at the state capitol last week, they told lawmakers they feared that a surge in cases would cost more lives, including those of health workers.A surge of Covid-19 infections would exhaust the state’s personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies, warned Mary Turner, a critical care nurse at North Memorial Health hospital and president of the Minnesota Nurses Association.“We are approaching the surge point very fast,” Turner said.About 17,700 cases have been reported in the state, and 777 deaths. It is far from the worst outbreak in the US – but numbers are still rising. In the meantime, hospitals have been reusing N95 masks that technically expired in 2001 and 2002. Supplies of gowns ran so short last month that some local hospitals ordered rain ponchos as a backup.Even Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, believes worse is to come. “It is going to get worse here before it gets better. That is an absolute guarantee,” Walz, a Democrat, told reporters as he outlined his cautious reopening plan.Social scientists at Northwestern University have surveyed 200 people a day since mid-March, and have found that unlike in other disasters, the US is not unifying in response to this crisis.“It has been a solidarity- and trust-destroying disaster,” said Beth Redbird, the primary researcher. “We usually see disasters as unifying. They bring us together, they unite us, they increase support for our neighbors, to help each other out. But while we see anecdotal stories of that in the press, we haven’t actually seen a lot of data supporting that that’s what’s going on.”We have been here before. The threats of a second wave were borne out in the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which a third of the world’s population were infected with the virus.The spread was successfully curtailed in San Francisco thanks to the prompt implementation of mitigation measures including a city-wide shutdown and requirement to wear masks in public.As the infection rate dwindled, city leaders relaxed the lockdown measures in November 1918 bars, restaurants and sports arenas reopened, and people poured out onto the streets in celebration, tossing their masks in the process. A month later, the second wave hit San Francisco, but this time much of the public – including the Anti-Mask League – resisted public health mandates. The city ended up with nearly 45,000 cases and over 3,200 reported deaths. San Francisco ended up being one of the country’s worst-hit major cities.Stephen Morse, director of the infectious disease epidemiology program at Columbia University medical center, said as long as the virus is circulating in humans, there will be flare-ups as soon as it’s introduced to a street, town or county with enough susceptible people.“It’s like adding kindling to embers,” said Morse.Whether these inevitable localized outbreaks are contained or will multiply depends on the golden trio of testing, quarantine and contact tracing. If enough places implement these measures comprehensively, the chain of transmission could be broken, and the flare-ups snuffed out.“We don’t know what’s going to happen next, we have to proceed with caution and we could get lucky,” Morse said. “The big fear is that with the virus still in circulation, if we allow it to have unfettered access to people, then we certainly have the makings of a second pandemic of even larger proportions.”It’s not all about timing. The country’s patchwork response to the outbreak has also played an important role – and will likely continue to do so.“For the first time in my lifetime, there’s been an almost total lack of global coordination and US federal leadership, whose confusing and contradictory messages have been counterproductive and very destructive,” Morse said.It’s unclear whether the US has even fully emerged from the first wave, but the virus remains as infectious and lethal as it was when it emerged.And the conditions that have left low-income groups, communities of colour and Native Americans the hardest-hit remain, with infections and complications including death.“To think the virus must have changed just because we’re tired of being at home is almost a fantasy,” said Chandra Ford, founding director of the center for the study of racism, social justice and health at UCLA’s Jonathan and Karin Fielding school of public health.Ford warned subsequent outbreaks are likely to disproportionately affect these same communities.“The US response to the pandemic at the federal level has lacked a meaningful public health response,” said Ford. “So it’s not surprising that the push to reopen isn’t driven by public health indicators. In fact, it appears to be driven against public health indicators, in the interest of political or economic gains.”From the beginning, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most basic guidelines to stem the spread of Covid-19 ran up against some fundamental injustices in the US system. Workers are not guaranteed paid sick leave and healthcare is not universal.Prisons, meatpacking plants and nursing homes have seen a disproportionate amount of cases. In New York City, the impact has overwhelmingly been felt in poorer communities where mostly immigrants and people of color live.“Historical and current experiences of discrimination and medical racism provide fodder for people to be willing to accept explanations that are not true,” Ford said. “Trust matters tremendously. Mistrust of healthcare providers and public health messages will fuel the pandemic itself and disparities in the pandemic.”In Georgia, one of the first states to start reopening, even business owners are worried.Brian Maloof, owner of the Atlanta’s famous Manuel’s Tavern, said: “The attitude is that it’s too early to open with the population density. This is where the predominance of the cases are.”He lives in the outskirts of the city and said there, parking lots are jammed with cars and people are packing into shopping malls and restaurants. He doesn’t expect the same crush of people inside the city. Maloof said: “There is a tremendous amount of fear here in Atlanta.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de8718c67db1ceacfcbb3a7b31ea91c7a872921b/0_7_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b4011ac978f57bfd8cd5a64fc3f82d5","title":"canary islands reopen to tourists offering sun sea sand and safety","story":"First tourists will arrive in July as holiday hotspots, beaches, hotels and restaurants embrace new social distancing rulesThey’ve picked apart the holiday experience, lingering on moments such as breakfast buffets, poolside lounging and golf tee times. As officials in Spain’s Canary Islands gear up to receive tourists as early as July, every aspect of travel is being recast against the backdrop of Covid-19.“We call it a global laboratory for safe tourism,” Cristina del Río Fresen of the region’s tourism ministry told the Observer. “We’re analysing every link in the chain – everything that has anything to do with the tourist experience, we want to make it safe from a health perspective.”Since the start of this month, she has led a team of more than 200 people, including health and industry professionals, to hammer out protocols for everything from hotels to restaurants and museums. The aim is to rebrand the islands, which include Lanzarote and Tenerife, as tourist destinations that offer safety along with the usual sun, sand and sea.The new protocols, which begin in July, embrace physical distancing: hotel common areas are set to be enlarged and sunbeds moved apart buffet breakfasts will be served, making use of partitions to separate guests from the food and extra serving staff and all-inclusive vacations will rely on either automated machines or extra staff to serve drinks.The hope is to offer holidays that won’t be overshadowed by the virus. “We’re making an effort to avoid screens or the use of masks,” said Del Río Fresen. “All those things that can lead to a sense of insecurity.”As Spain slowly staggers out of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, the government has come under pressure to follow countries such as Italy and Greece in setting a firm date for the return of tourists. It responded to their call on Saturday, with prime minister Pedro Sánchez announcing the country would reopen to international tourism in July.“Foreign tourists can now start planning their vacations to Spain … Today we’re sending a message to all: Spain will be waiting for you from July,” said Sánchez. He promised that safety would be a hallmark of Spanish tourism. “We’re guaranteeing that tourists will not run any risks, nor will they bring any risk to our country.”He pointed to several reasons. “There’s so much anxiety and tension over the contagion, it’s not comfortable for tourism,” he said. “And then there’s the bigger issue: an economic crisis, the likes of which we’ve never seen before. Many will lack the resources to travel while others will be living in fear of losing their jobs.” For British tourists, there is a third reason: a new 14-day quarantine to be imposed from 8 June on anyone – including British nationals – returning to the UK from abroad.Even so, municipalities across the country have already started rolling out plans for a beach season in the shadow of the virus from apps that warn of crowded beaches to systems that allow for advance reservation of spots on the sand. Others have floated plans to segregate sunbathers by age or hire extra security to ensure beachgoers remain at least two metres apart.In the Canary Islands, officials are preparing for some international visitors in July, when a small number of hotels plan to open their doors. “But we have to bear in mind one critical factor: the state of outbreaks in other countries,” the head of the Canary Islands government, Ángel Victor Torres Pérez, told the Observer. “Our main markets are the UK, Germany, Scandinavian countries and Italy. While I’m convinced things are getting better, if the pandemic strengthens in these countries, flights could be restricted.”The Canary Islands emerged relatively unscathed by the virus, with 155 lives claimed among the 2.1 million residents. But the wider threat of the virus was laid bare in February when several guests carrying the virus checked into a Tenerife hotel, forcing some 800 tourists and 200 workers into quarantine and landing the region in headlines around the world.Still, it remains to be seen just how keen tourists will be to venture across international borders. “I think the tourists will come little by little,” said Del Río Fresen. “It will be a gradual recovery.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b15d2135decc09d02e270a530e869521a39ab8c/0_147_5955_3573/master/5955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2b87016618bad2489acbab05206cb41","title":"eid celebrations go virtual uk muslims urged stay home","story":"Mosques to host prayers online with festivities restricted due to lockdown measuresMuslims across Britain are preparing to celebrate Eid al-Fitr remotely this weekend, with many mosques set to host virtual prayers during continued lockdown measures.The religious festival marking the end of Ramadan usually brings families and friends together for communal prayers, food and to exchange gifts.But this year community leaders have encouraged people to stay at home and adhere to physical distancing measures to curb the spread of Covid-19.Shaz Saleem, the secretary of Dudley Central mosque in the West Midlands, said Eid prayers would be held virtually via a WhatsApp group.“Our only guidance to people has been to stay at home, stay safe. There’s nothing stopping people from having a little garden thing at home with their household, but it’s not the same thing,” he said.“It’s like our Christmas, and it’s an excuse for all families to get together. We’ve got elderly relatives, and we can’t go and see them because we don’t want to pose a risk to them. It’s quite unfortunate and sad in that respect.”The mosque has been hosting virtual prayers throughout Ramadan and Saleem said that although celebrating remotely was the right thing to do this year, not being able to see loved ones would be a test for the community after an already difficult few months.Dozens from the Muslim community in Dudley have died after contracting coronavirus. A banner has been pinned on a wall outside the mosque thanking frontline NHS staff for “protecting us all”.Qari Asim, a senior imam at Makkah mosque in Leeds, said he would deliver an online sermon on the morning of Eid, send well-wishes to his congregation on Facebook and drop off cakes, baked at home with his family, to people in the community.He said the situation was “really surreal” but that Muslims had no other choice.“There is a palpable sense of sadness in the community given that usually mosques are jam-packed with people on this auspicious day,” he added. Other mosques, including the Islamic Centre in Nottingham, have offered guidance to people on how to celebrate Eid at home via Facebook videos. Some, such as the Khidmat Centre in Bradford, have handed out gift packs to children whose families are struggling financially.At a Downing Street press conference on Thursday, the UK’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, urged Muslims to “adapt the celebrations” around physical distancing rules.“The reason we must all do that is, this is to protect the whole community, all communities and all of us must find ways around this, of whatever faith,” said Whitty.The Muslim Council of Britain has issued specific guidance for each nation, and urged people to celebrate Eid “in the same way as Ramadan: from home, and virtually with friends and family”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2401aa0e8d6dc0c8c9e1600cac04de4e0c3b5a0/0_286_5006_3003/master/5006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48bf0bef8c476b7205c12d71210aaeaf","title":"us security officials considered return to nuclear testing after 28 year hiatus","story":"Discussion held this month as way to press Russia and China into agreeing arms control deal, officials sayUS officials have debated whether to carry out the first US nuclear tests in 28 years as a way to pressure Russia and China into make a trilateral arms control deal, according congressional aides and former officials.They said the discussion took place at a “deputies meeting” of senior national security officials at the White House on 15 May, but that the proposal was shelved for the time being.“There are still some professionals in the room who told them this is a terrible idea, thank God,” a congressional aide said.The discussion was first reported on Friday night by the Washington Post, which cited a senior administration official as saying that a demonstration to Moscow and Beijing that the United States could carry out a “rapid test” could be a useful bargaining counter in the achieving the administration’s priority on arms control – a trilateral deal with Russia and China.The report also quoted a senior administration official as saying the proposal was “very much an ongoing conversation”.The deputies committee discussion has come at a time when arms control is in danger of dying out altogether. The Trump administration has pulled out of three arms control agreements, the latest this week with an announcement that the US will withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, which allows the Russia and western nations to conduct observation overflights of each other’s territories.The last major arms control treaty left standing is the 2010 New Start agreement, limiting US and Russian deployed strategic warheads. It is due to expire in February next year but the Trump administration has said it does not want to extend it without bringing China into arms control negotiations. Beijing has refused, on the grounds that its stockpile is tiny compared with the US and Russian arsenals (estimated at just over a twentieth of the size).The apparent motive behind the proposal to resume US testing was somehow to add pressure on China.The US, and the four other officially recognised nuclear weapons powers, signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1996, but the Senate voted not to ratify the treaty, which still does not have enough ratifications to enter into force.The US has observed a moratorium on testing since 1992, in line with other nuclear powers. Breaking that moratorium could doom the CTBT, and prove destabilising at a time when there are fears of a new arms race.“I’ve heard officials speculate the US might have to test if confidence in the stockpile eroded, but never that it could be used to coerce anyone into negotiations,” Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists, said.“That’s completely nuts. They must be getting desperate. Instead, what it certainly would do is push China and all the other nuclear-armed states to test as well. How can someone in their right mind think that would be in the security interest of the United States or its allies?”The US has accused both Russia and China of carrying out very low-yield tests in secret, but both countries have denied the accusations.The NNSA, an agency of the energy department, has the job of maintaining the readiness of the US nuclear arsenal, and has developed computer diagnostic tools to check the state of the warheads, drawing on data from the 1,054 tests the US carried out between 1945 and 1992.“By and large, the scientists and engineers and the nuclear weapons enterprise have been very satisfied with that approach,” said Frank Klotz, who served as NNSA administrator in the Obama administration and the first year of the Trump administration.Each year, the heads of the three US nuclear weapons laboratories – Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia – as well as the head of US Strategic Command, are required to certify that a resumption of testing is not needed.“They have said that they see no technical reason to resume testing for the foreseeable future. And that was the statement that was made when I left,” Klotz, a retired air force lieutenant general, said. “Whether that’s changed or not I don’t know. I doubt it, quite frankly.”“There are veterans of the era in which we did do testing ... who have advocated for a return to testing, but I think the vast majority of the people in the enterprise feel like it’s not necessary, and should only be done if there is some compelling technical problem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:New testimony from sources suggests that Dominic Cummings, chief aide to the British prime minister, made at least two trips from London to Durham, and travelled to tourist hotspots in the north-east of England. The reports have led to a chorus of calls for the spin doctor to be sacked, including from the leaders of the Liberal Democrats and SNP, while Labour called for an urgent investigation.Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York had recorded 84 new deaths from coronavirus on 22 May, the first time the figure has dropped below 100 since late March. He also eased the ban on group gatherings, altering restrictions to allow up to 10 people to meet up.France recorded a further 250 deaths, bringing the total to 144,806. However, after confirming several hundred deaths on Friday, Spain’s death toll stood at 28,678 on Saturday, 346 more than France. This is the first time the Spanish toll has overtaken the French for 10 days, giving Spain the world’s fourth-highest death toll after the US, Britain and Italy.Donald Trump has stirred fresh controversy after travelling from the White House to play a round of golf at his Virginia club. Despite a rising American death toll, which is now approaching 100,000, Trump has been keen to return the US to normality, and encouraging states to kickstart their economies.The British government has announced it is investing £283m into getting public transport back to normal services, having been cut back during the coronavirus pandemic. However, transport secretary Grant Shapps said that even a fully restored service would only be capable of carrying, at best, one fifth of normal capacity, to allow for social distancing.More than 40 people have been infected with coronavirus after attending a mass in Frankfurt earlier this month. Six were admitted to hospital. The service was held on 10 May, a few days after the reopening of places of worship in Germany, the daily Frankfurter Rundschau reported. Germany began to relax the restrictions put in place to control the spread of the virus at the beginning of May, after a strong decline in new cases, but fears remain of a second wave in the country.The Indian government has pledged to organise special trains to get at least 3.6 million stranded migrant workers back to their homes. Many have been walking for hundred of miles, after becoming stranded in cities where work ceased to be available due to the pandemic.Beaches in Cyprus have reopened, as the country marks its first day of zero new cases of coronavirus since its first cases were reported on 9 March. Residents had only been allowed to swim, but can now congregate on the beaches as long as they remain spaced apart.

One shrew, in a laboratory, did manage to tuck in, but shrews must keep eating or die.Sticky, ribbon-flat, pointed at both ends, the dark-brown Arthurdendyus triangulatus from New Zealand and orangey Australoplana sanguinea from Australia are shapeshifting animals, best inspected on the internet.They seem to attract much human curiosity. Three of the Australian flatworms were discovered this month in the vegetable garden of Friends of the Irish Environment (FIE) on the Beara Peninsula in west Cork.A posting of this on the FIE’s Facebook page was viewed more than 17,000 times in four days. Perhaps there was relief from boredom with one plague in sharing the concern about another.Apart from their over-smooth looks, the flatworms’ chief offence is their appetite for earthworms. My drawing is half of their favourite prey, the large and admirable Lumbricus terrestris earthworm, key architect of the structure and fertility of soil. The flatworms’ predatory appetite sparked concern when, in the 1960s, the first New Zealand species was found in a Belfast garden, most probably arriving in the soil of imported plants. The adult animals can last a year without food and pot plants can also contain their egg capsules, resembling small blackcurrants. The global plant trade has also spread this invader to Scotland, the Faroes and the Republic, but its density in Northern Ireland remains exceptional. Scottish records are mainly from city gardens and garden centres but its rapid expansion in the north of Ireland has taken it almost everywhere, across farmland, heather moor, woods and wetlands.An assessment by Dr Roy Anderson of Queen’s University Belfast noted its ability to devastate garden populations of large earthworms. He found only “patchy” evidence of serious damage on agricultural land but he accepted that, with the loss of earthworm drainage and a surface thatch of uneaten leaves, the North’s problem with impacted soil could grow even worse.Moreover, systematic surveys of grass fields found the flatworm in 70 per cent of them by 1998, often at the moister margins of pasture. Concern was especially for the toll on lumbricid earthworms, whose wide vertical burrows make it easy for flatworms to pursue, attack and absorb them. The burrows, topped with fresh casts of earth, bring oxygen and water into the soil, adding greatly to its structure and drainage. They also allow worms to retrieve leaf litter from the surface, digesting and recycling their nutrients. This vital role, first examined by Darwin, is at the heart of flatworm research.In four years of fieldwork, for example, Dr Archie Murchie and Dr Alan Gordon of the North’s Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute identified and weighed more than 25,000 inidual earthworms. Their 2013 report concluded that a spread of less than one flatworm per square metre, matching “natural infestations” in grassland, would cut earthworm biomass by about one-fifth. This, they said, “poses a serious risk to L terrestris, with implications for soil functioning and indigenous earthworm-feeding wildlife”. Among the latter are the blackbirds, thrushes, seagulls, badgers, foxes and pine martens.The flatworms’ spread in the North is in contrast to sparse occurrence in the Republic, mainly in the disturbed soil of gardens and garden centres. Dr Anderson had pointed to the animal’s intolerance for soil temperatures above 23 degrees, hence its preference for the cooler, moister landscapes of the North.The Australian flatworm, however, is clearly at home under the rocks, pots, plastic sheets and buckets of the Republic’s gardens and plant centres. A map of reports to the National Bioersity Data Centre shows clusters in city gardens, but also in rural Cork and Waterford. This echoes its chief distribution in the southwest of England.‘Left with nothing else’Eye on Nature has already drawn many reports of Australian flatworms and the 17,000 visits to the FIE Facebook resulted in many more. A gardener on the Beara Peninsula wrote of being “left with nothing else”. The FIE has urged more citizen gardeners to search under anything lying on the ground and send their records to the data centre.In the UK, flatworms in imported pot plants engage the vigorous campaigners of the NGO Buglife, which deplores the lack of biosecurity measures to exclude or check for the animals or their eggs. This may well become a cause for the Irish Wildlife Trust, but devising any practical measures will remain a challenging prospect. On both islands, gardeners are urged to uncover, seek out or trap them (the FIE offers ways and means). They should also encourage large, predatory ground beetles, such as the dearg-a-daoil, or rove beetle, that find an appetite for sticky-toffee planarians."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

More than 150 children in New York state have been reported as having the condition, about 10 times the normal number of cases that arise.Pims shares similar disease characteristics to Kawasaki syndrome.Dr Holohan, who said the HSE will be raising awareness on the issue, said it was a “very rare” condition, with an incidence rate of about 15 for every 100,000 children. He said said his advice was directed principally at clinicians, not parents.“This is about considering when other conditions that might explain these symptoms have been ruled out to consider this possibility.“We want clinicians to be more suspicious that this could be, in an unusual set of circumstances with a sick child, a possible explanation.”Kawasaki disease, aka mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, is a rare condition that mainly affects children under five years old. It causes a severe fever that does not respond to medication, and a variety of virus-like symptoms, including a rash, swollen glands and dry and cracked lips. The cause of Kawasaki disease, which was first diagnosed in 1967 by a Japanese doctor called Dr Tomisaku Kawasaki, is still unknown, and there is no single test or procedure that can confirm the diagnosis.Pims has characteristics similar to those of Kawasaki disease. The children also showed at least two of the following symptoms: rash or signs of inflammation around the mouth, hands or feet shock or low blood pressure heart problems evidence of bleeding disorder and acute gastrointestinal problems.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"North west of capital has highest concentration of coronavirus cases in the countyHSE emergency call handling staff flown to work in Co Donegal as a result of the blazeNursing home body says voice of the sector \u0026lsquowasn\u0026rsquot heard\u0026rsquo at the start of pandemicMinister for Health establishes nursing homes expert panel to examine Government responseResults of survey will inform phased reopening of childcare facilities from June 29thDepartment of Health describes spend as \u0026lsquoadvance payments\u0026rsquo and final bill could changeDublin Fire Brigade units and garda\u0026iacute respond to incident in DrimnaghSecond man (47) remains in custody over Co Cork incident in which garda fired shotTony Holohan says Health Service Executive will be raising awareness of issueCabinet meeting discussed lowering distancing requirements down to one metreCovid-19 restrictions had stopped 360 Irish peace-keeping troops from returningSuspect in 40 detained by PSNI after warning by Garda that he may be armed with gunSuspect in late teens detained after van searched in TulskNetwork could advise government on viruses, climate change and water supply issuesOne car detecting going more than 200kmh on Dublin\u0026rsquos 100kmh limit M50Health watchdog queried on \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo non-compliance prior to Covid-19 pandemicMinisters discuss stringent measures including 14-day stay at \u0026lsquodesignated facility\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoLack of clarity\u0026rsquo in liquor laws means publicans can sell drink for takeaway or deliveryAll medical procedures permitted in Irish law will be provided for, hospital group saysNew rules designed to minimise infection risks from Covid-19 in hospitals set outStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4261085.1590237407!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 taoiseach insists no change from two metre social distancing advice","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tElectronic signs in the Phoenix Park in Dublin give advice on social distancing. Photograph: Crispin RodwellTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said “that there is no change to the advice to maintain a physical distance of two metres,” according to his spokesman. “The public health advice from Nphet stands,” he said. Earlier this week the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the two metre distance was something that would be kept under review, when questioned at a daily Nphet press briefing.At a lengthy meeting of the Cabinet on Friday evening, several Ministers advocated for social distancing rules to be reduced from two to one metres between people.World Health Organisation (WHO) coronavirus guidance around social distancing advises people to keep “a distance of 1 metre (3 feet) between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.”Public health advice in Ireland opts for a recommendation people keep two metres from others, to avoid the spread of droplets from one person to another. Minister for State with responsibility for disability issues Finian McGrath raised the prospect of Ireland moving to the requirement to keep one metre from others, at a Cabinet meeting on Friday. A small number of Cabinet colleagues were supportive of the move, which would make it easier for schools, restaurants, pubs and other small businesses to re-open and adhere to public health advice. It is understood the issue will be discussing during a general meeting on public health measures between Cabinet members and Dr Holohan next week. There was some pushback at the Cabinet meeting over the “ultra-cautious” approach taken by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to the easing of lockdown restrictions, one source said. The proposal to reduce the social distancing advice was not “shot down” outright, they said. Commenting at the briefing last Tuesday, Dr Holohan said Nphet would not “rule out” a review of the two metre rule. The guidance around social distancing would be kept under “continual review,” he said. Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the national virus reference laboratory, said he would have “concern” about reducing the distance “at this point.”Speaking at the same briefing, he said the current distance was based on knowledge about how far droplets can travel from a person, and then potentially infect someone else. However, he acknowledged moving to a one metre distance “would make life easier in certain circumstances.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4261135.1590266799!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"highest covid 19 incidence recorded on northside of dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHenry Street in Dublin on Friday.

Photograph: TwitterArchaeologists in Spain have found part of a skull and a femur (thigh bone) in their search for the remains of Red Hugh O’Donnell, one of the great tragic heroes of Irish history. O’Donnell died en-route to Valladolid, a city in northwestern Spain, in July 1602 having failed to persuade the Spanish king Philip III to send another army to Ireland to fight against the English.On day five of the dig in Valladolid’s Constitution Street on Friday, the archaeologists recovered human remains. A tweet from the city’s tourism and culture department read: “A part of the skull, a femur, and some more remains appear in what appears to be the access to the Chapel of the Marvels.”The city’s culture councillor Ana Redondo posted a shamrock emoji and the words “estamos cerca” - “we are close”. The archaeologists involved are also searching for the remains of Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 became the first European to discover the Americas.He was buried in the same place as O’Donnell. However, Columbus’s remains were allegedly removed and reburied in the cathedral of Seville and later in the Dominican Republic. Speaking on Friday, which was the 514th anniversary of the funeral of Columbus in Valladolid, chief archaeologist Óscar Burón said he believed that both O’Donnell and Columbus are “buried right under our feet and now we are concerned with checking whether the research we have undertaken is correct”. He described O’Donnell as an “Irish prince and the hero of the resistance against the English”. O’Donnell and his father-in-law Hugh Mor O’Neill, who between them controlled large parts of the north of Ireland, started the Nine Years War to drive the English out of Ireland.Battle of KinsaleIt began promisingly and the Irish won a number of significant victories, but eventually ended in defeat following the siege and then the Battle of Kinsale in late 1601 and early 1602.A combined force of Spanish and Irish troops was defeated by the English in one of the worst military setbacks in Irish history, after which Red Hugh fled to Spain.Though Philip III never did provide the soldiers requested by Red Hugh, he did give him the equivalent of a royal funeral as described in the Annals of the Four Masters.“His body was conveyed to the king’s palace at Valladolid in a four-wheeled hearse, surrounded by countless numbers of the king’s state officers, council, and guards, with luminous torches and bright flambeaux of beautiful wax-light burning on each side of him.” He was buried within the Chapel of Marvels in the grounds of the Franciscan convent in Valladolid. The convent disappeared in 1836 and with it O’Donnell’s remains.In a statement, Valladolid city council’s cultural department said finding the remains of O’ Donnell would be a “spur to the dissemination of this city abroad and also, of course, within Spain.“The burial in Valladolid of these two characters of such relevance to the world as is the case of Columbus and to relations between Spain and Ireland against their common enemy: England, demonstrate the importance of Spain and specifically of Valladolid for centuries.” On Thursday the team of archaeologists located other human bones, but not those of O’Donnell. They hope that his remains will be easy to identify as he lost the big toes on both of feet from frostbite after he escaped from prison in Dublin in December 1591. He fled into the Wicklow mountains in the depth of winter. His companion Art O’Neill froze to death in the escape.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Another day, another small step back towards normal. While outdoor markets were given the green light to restart trading as of last Monday, many waited until the weekend before they dusted down their stalls and started serving customers again.And in the car park of the Airfield Estate in Dundrum on Saturday morning, the people and those doing the serving could scarcely have been more delighted by the turn of events.People queued happily for fresh fish and herbs and vegetables pulled from the soil only hours previously. While shoppers seemed pleased with the produce on offer at the handful of stalls that braved perilously high winds to set up shop, they were even happier to be able to simply shop, almost without fear.“We are delighted to be back outside,” Brian Lenihan said as he and his infant child stood waiting to make a purchase at the vegetable stall. “We got through the lockdown okay and it has been great to spend more time with the children.”As he looked around his voice trailed off. “It is still a very peculiar time and even here today people are looking at each other just a little bit differently than they used to, everyone’s a little bit more wary and they’re keeping their distance more than they ever would have in the past.”The man about to serve him fruit and vegetables was Simon Conron. “I’m just so happy to be back, it’s so good,” he said with a broad smile plastered across his face. “It has been going very well here so far today and it has been very easy to maintain social distance so I’m feeling pretty good about things. I think people are just so happy to be outside. We have all lived through a very strange time and hopefully we are coming to the end of it now.”Marie Hanley stood nearby and nodded in agreement. “This market used to always be on a Friday and I could never make it so I’m delighted to be here and to be honest I’ll buy anything,” she said.Jason Francis was wearing an Airfield jacket and carefully watching the shoppers shop. “I’m here to keep an eye on things but so far I haven’t had to say or do very much as everybody is really conscious of the social distancing thing. We’re taking small steps but isn’t it great to be taking those little steps? It is great to get a bit of normality back.”At a stall selling elderflower cordials and fresh herbs an exchange took place that would have been unimaginable even three months ago.“I am smiling under the mask,” the stallholder said to customers she clearly knew but hadn’t seen in some time.“I can see that in your eyes, your eyes look happy,” came the response.The stallholder’s name was Ana Axinte. “Business has been constant this morning,” she said. “Everyone is really enthusiastic and really chatty, I am ecstatic to be back. It is so good to have a bit of normality back in the world. It’s a Saturday morning and I’m at a farmers’ market and that feels just great.”Across the car park, a large queue had formed at the pop-up fish shop manned by owner and restaurateur Niall Sabongi, who was dispatching seafood and dispensing advice like a master.The queue looked even longer than it might have thanks to the social distancing requirements but there was no need for tape or decals to remind people where to stand. Everyone knew without being told.The fresh – and living, pinching – lobster and the John Dory were in huge demand, as was the organic Irish salmon. Most, if not all, the fish was caught off the coast of Ireland by small boats in the last 48 hours.Until the pandemic hit, Sabongi’s Sustainable Seafood Ireland business primarily supplied high-end restaurants, including his own fish restaurants in Dublin. They have all closed for now so he has moved into the retail business in a big way. “It’s lovely to get out and meet people,” he said.Almost overnight the company has developed a big online presence and done so under the shadow of coronavirus, in more ways than one.“I was sick with Covid at the very beginning and from my bed I started to get the website ready,” Sabongi said. “I was hit pretty hard. I know it’s described as the flu but I found it to be very tough,” he recalled. “It’s great to be outside again.”Rita Goode was equally delighted as she surveyed her depleted stall. It was not even midday and she had sold virtually all her supply of seasonable vegetables, including cauliflower cabbage, courgettes and mixed salad leaves. “It was very hard to judge how much we need to because I didn’t know if people would be afraid to come out but they are not afraid at all, they are absolutely thrilled to be here. It is just so nice to see this happening now.

Photograph: EPABritish prime minister Boris Johnson’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings made a second 420km trip from London during the coronavirus lockdown, the Daily Mirror and Observer newspapers reported on Saturday.Mr Johnson on Saturday resisted calls from opposition parties to sack Mr Cummings after it was revealed that he had travelled to northern England while his wife showed Covid-19 symptoms, to arrange child care for his young son.According to a joint investigation by the Mirror and the Observer, Mr Cummings was seen in woodland near the northern city of Durham on April 19th, days after he had returned to London from his first trip in late March and early April.Mr Cummings has said he “behaved reasonably and legally” when he travelled from his London home to Co Durham during the lockdown in late March, apparently in breach of government restrictions on travel.Asked if he would consider his position, Mr Cummings said: “Obviously not.” He then chided reporters for being wrong about the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum.“You guys are probably all about as right about that as you were about Brexit: do you remember how right you all were about that?” Mr Cummings said.Ministers had earlier voiced support for the senior adviser.“I can tell you that the PM provides Mr Cummings with his full support,” transport secretary Grant Shapps told reporters, adding that he did not know when the prime minister found out about the journey.Health secretary Hancock tweeted: “I know how ill coronavirus makes you. It was entirely right for Dom Cummings to find childcare for his toddler, when both he and his wife were getting ill.”Downing Street said Cummings’s “actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines”.OppositionOpposition parties have questioned why Cabinet ministers have defended Mr\u0026nbspCummings.A Labour source said: “If these latest revelations are true, why on earth were Cabinet ministers sent out this afternoon to defend\u0026nbspDominic Cummings?“We need an urgent investigation by the Cabinet Secretary to get to the bottom of this matter. It cannot be right that there is one rule for the Prime Minister’s adviser and another for the British people.”Just a few days before Mr Cummings’ journey, Johnson imposed a lockdown in the UK and asked people to stay at home. He said on March 23rd that people “should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home”.Shortly after Mr Johnson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19, Mr Cummings sprinted out of Downing Street on March 27th and developed symptoms on the weekend of March 28th-29th.Government guidelines say that those who have Covid-19 or suspect they have it should self-isolate for at least seven days along with their household and not leave their house for any reason.The Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats called for Cummings to be sacked.Other prominent figures have resigned after breaking lockdown rules.Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson quit as a member of the government’s scientific advisory group after he was visited at home by his girlfriend.

Conspiracy beliefs arguably travel further and faster than ever before.“Our survey indicates that people who hold such beliefs share them social media provides a ready-made platform.”“In the wake of the epidemic, mistrust looks to have become mainstream,” Prof Freeman added.The research project is funded by the NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ticking economic time bomb detonate tories","story":"Yowzers. We knew that Covidonomics was expensive, but it is still something to see the numbers feed through the machine. The Government has borrowed more in the past month than it did in the whole of 2019. That’s a deficit of £62 billion just for April. For comparison’s sake, the annual deficit for the whole of 2009 was £160 billion.It wasn’t so long ago that the Prime Minister was having some pernickety fight with his Chancellor about fiscal rules. We knew Sajid Javid’s successor would loosen the belt a bit – and then Covid-19 came along. Rules schmules.Naturally, the spending splurge has prompted questions about whether this is 2008 all over again, only bigger, and if it is, when does the austerity drive start? Sure enough, George Osborne popped up on the radio claiming that the cuts would have to start in two or three years to get the books back in order.But Boris Johnson’s Tories aren’t buying it. With British streets clapping their hearts out for the NHS and mass unemployment on the way when the furlough schemes ends, a political party willing to take Mr Osborne’s retrograde advice can only be one with a death wish.Instead, the working assumption, for now, is that all this extra borrowing is just fine for two reasons. First, it’s cheap. Interest rates are low, the Bank of England has promised to keep buying bonds and markets aren’t bothered. Secondly, it’s temporary. Just wait till the economy pings back into action and growth will start shrinking the debt burden right back down.But there is a third, unspoken notion underlying both of these ones. It’s the assumption that inflation will behave itself.In the last decade, we have become so used to low inflation, despite extraordinarily loose monetary policy, that economists are almost wholly fixated on the dangers of deflation, or falling prices, arising from this crisis. So worrying is this prospect that the Bank of England has admitted that it could deliberately pursue a policy of negative rates – forcing investors to pay for the pleasure of lending money. This sounds crazy, and yet, with a third of all bond yields already in negative territory before Covid hit, much of the financial world has somehow operated on this basis for years.The assumption that the virus will cause deflation is based on the idea that mass lay-offs will take a huge chunk of demand out of the system. Workers with drastically reduced incomes will stop spending money and prices will fall, causing consumers to delay purchases, in turn cutting prices even more and entering a spiral. Meanwhile, the national debt burden will grow relative to prices, so it becomes more and more expensive to service.Bad as this is, there is, in fact, an even grimmer possibility. It is that Covid-19 will actually cause inflation to shoot up. The “Case for Inflation”, published recently in Deutsche Bank’s Konzept magazine, suggests that most economists are misinterpreting the whole crisis. Social distancing, lockdowns and their consequences primarily deliver a shock to the supply of goods and services, rather than to demand.As soon as you think about it, this argument makes obvious sense. If cafes close and flights are cancelled and can only then resume service at much reduced capacity because patrons and passengers have to keep one or two metres apart, the obvious result is that prices rise.Baristas and airlines simply cannot afford to keep selling less stuff at the same price and many will go out of business, reducing supply even further. Add to that a massive Government stimulus, the geopolitical risk of trade war and a decision to cut down global supply chains and strategically reduce reliance on Chinese goods, and you have all the ingredients for a big rise in costs, hence in prices.From a Government point of view, some degree of inflation is a good thing. The best-case scenario for fiscal hawks is for inflation to rise, but not too much. If it were to bump along at 4 or 5 per cent, it would steadily help to erode the value of the national debt without destabilising the economy more broadly. This is what “good behaviour” looks like.But if inflation shoots up too much, it can cause a rise in public borrowing costs, because it forces the Bank of England to counter price rises by tightening monetary policy and reducing its purchase of Government bonds. In turn, markets start to expect inflation and demand higher interest payments for lending to the Government.In a sense, then, we come right back to those old fiscal rules that our politicians were squabbling about in January. The Tory manifesto promised to keep spending money so long as it was cheap to borrow. If the cost of borrowing rises, then either the Government takes over the Bank of England and starts printing money like a crazed dictator (causing inflation to balloon) or it has to think seriously about how it is going to meet those costs.With political tolerance for spending cuts still low, the likelihood is that it will reach for the lever of higher taxes. A newly competitive Labour Party under a palatable leader will be well-placed to argue that it is the turn of “the rich” to join the “national effort” by coughing up, just as they did after World War Two. And a country angry over the mistakes inevitably revealed by any Covid-19 inquiry, still suffering the effects of this year’s recession, let alone the effects of any second virus wave and lockdown, could well buy the argument.The alternative, of course, is that fiscal conditions remain relatively benign and we spring back to a growth rate that comfortably pays down our virus debts. That way we avoid the prospect of politically toxic, economically risky austerity at a fragile time.But there are still losers. A decision not to worry about the deficit is ultimately a decision not to worry too much about inflation, so long as it is sure and steady. Savers lose out and prices rise. Interest rates stay low and investors still cannot work out where to put all their cash, pushing up asset prices and feeding continued misallocation of capital.The only thing to be said for this policy is that all of the alternatives look worse. We’d better hope that a technology-driven growth miracle arrives to bail us out.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china enjoys creating version events not give material","story":"The deepening Sino-American Cold War has reached a surreal new stage. The Chinese state-owned TV channel CGTN this week worked up a new piece of propaganda called “Pompeo’s Credibility Test”. It’s a lurid mock-up of a computer game, in which a fat cartoon Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, loses health points every time he “lies” about coronavirus. In the background, a Chinese PPE-clad figure delivers kapows to a hovering virus particle.Meanwhile, Donald Trump is angry with what he calls “some wacko in China” who, he says, “released a statement blaming everyone except China”. It isn’t clear who or what he means. As Bill Bishop, the author of China report Sinocism, puts it: “None of this is normal, whatever normal is these days.”It ought to go without saying that unless there is verification, no one should believe a word that issues from the mouths of the Chinese authorities. The American authorities, on the other hand, are meant to be the reliable ones – not because Americans are inherently better, but because American politicians can be caught out and criticised when they lie.It would be a good idea, therefore, for Mr Pompeo to consider the effect of his words around the world, where the US is striving to win an information war, rather than providing easy fodder for the Chinese Communist Party by repeatedly contradicting himself on television.In one recent appearance, he did so within the space of a minute, seemingly without noticing, first stating that he believes the virus to be genetically engineered and then stating that it wasn’t (helpful primer: it isn’t, but that still doesn’t mean it couldn’t have leaked from a lab).China’s propagandists are creative enough on their own. They don’t need to be handed material.Isolation may be boring, but it also seems to foment a creative impulse in some people. For example, my aunt, who lives alone, has spent a number of long evenings performing her favourite songs on the piano, from Count Your Blessings (Reginald Morgan and Edith Temple) to Beyond the Sea (Bobby Darin) and Waterloo Sunset (The Kinks). There is something uniquely moving about watching a piece of music performed beautifully in total isolation. Perhaps one’s sensitivities are heightened and every bit of emotion goes into the playing, since it can’t go into social outlets.The painting Washing (above) draws on that same feeling of days spent isolated at home. In this case, it is a mother on maternity leave with a lot of washing to do. The artist, Katherine Perrins, was looking after a new baby, hanging up clothes and gazing at her drying rack every day, but her artist’s brain was thinking simultaneously about light and altarpieces. The result is a sublime rendering of the mundane.Home-schooling likewise seems to be a source of great inspiration. A family I know spent an inordinate amount of time setting up, posing and photographing their own real-life tableau of a painting by Velázquez called Old Woman Cooking Eggs. Another family in Kent released a lockdown version of Les Misérables’ “One More Day” to acclaim. And a family in California spent days in isolation building a two-storey Rube Goldberg machine – an absurdist domino-style contraption – to the delight of geeks everywhere.In a similar vein, the BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac has been running a feature throughout the lockdown called “Isolation creations” – tracks created by artists while in isolation. One song in particular, called Introspective, captures the mood: “You’ve got to smile by yourself, run a mile by yourself,  Meditate, walk in the countryside by yourself,  Stand tall by yourself, rise and fall by yourself,  You were born alone and you will die all by yourself.”My own lockdown has been mostly taken up with chores and childcare (we are not yet at the Velázquez, or even finger-painting, stage), but I have managed to bake enough cakes to finish an entire bottle of vanilla essence. That has never happened before.Anton Chekhov knew something about isolation. His characters always seem to find themselves living the life of an unfulfilled intellectual in some godforsaken provincial town, surrounded by know-nothings. In Three Sisters, the would-be professor, Andrei, wistfully describes one of the peculiar comforts that only a busy city can offer: “In Moscow, you can sit in a huge restaurant without knowing anyone or being known and still not feel a stranger. Here you know everyone and everyone knows you but you’re a stranger, an utter stranger… and all alone.”I’m not sure what city living really is with the restaurants and cafés and galleries shut.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown saved no lives may have cost nobel prize winner believes","story":"Lockdown caused more deaths than it saved, a Nobel laureate scientist said on Saturday, as he predicted the UK would emerge from Covid-19 within weeks.Michael Levitt, a Stanford University professor who correctly predicted the initial trajectory of the pandemic, sent messages to Professor Neil Ferguson in March telling the influential government advisor he had over-estimated the potential death toll by 10 or 12 times.The Imperial College professor\u0027s modelling, a major factor in the Government\u0027s apparent abandoning of a so-called herd-immunity policy, was part of an unnecessary panic virus which spread among global political leaders, Prof Levitt now tells the .Prof Levitt, a British-American-Israeli who shared the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2013 for the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems, has said for two months that the planet will beat coronavirus faster than most other experts predict.I think lockdown saved no lives, said the scientist, who added that the Government should have encouraged Britons to wear masks and adhere to other forms of social distancing.I think it may have cost lives. It will have saved a few road accident lives - things like that - but social damage - domestic abuse, orces, alcoholism - has been extreme. And then you have those who were not treated for other conditions. Having assessed the initial outbreak in China and from the infected Diamond Princess cruise ship, he predicted by March 14 that the UK would lose around 50,000 lives. Prof Ferguson\u0027s modelling that same week estimated up to 500,000 deaths without social distancing measures.I think that the real virus was the panic virus, Prof Levitt told the . For reasons that were not clear to me, I think the leaders panicked and the people panicked and I think there was a huge lack of discussion.The 73-year-old has no background as an epidemiologist, but he assessed the outbreak in China and prepared a paper based on his own calculations. Most countries, he predicted, would suffer a Covid-19 death rate worth around an extra month in excess deaths over the calendar year.In Europe, I don\u0027t think that anything actually stopped the virus other than some kind of burnout, he added. There\u0027s a huge number of people who are asymptomatic so I would seriously imagine that by the time lockdown was finally introduced in the UK the virus was already widely spread. They could have just stayed open like Sweden by that stage and nothing would have happened.Professor Levitt has now analysed the data from 78 nations with more than 50 reported cases of coronavirus. His investigations proved the virus was never going to achieve the type of exponential growth that the researchers at Imperial were predicting at the same time.There is no doubt that you can stop an epidemic with lockdown but it\u0027s a very blunt and very medieval weapon and the epidemic could have been stopped just as effectively with other sensible measures (such as masks and other forms of social distancing), he added.It turns out numbers are played out very consistently when you look at all the places that have been badly hit, particularly in Europe. The token number of deaths before things stop is about one month of natural deaths, which is something like one in a thousand.Based on his estimates, Britain was due to suffer around 50,000 deaths in totals. A lot of things went wrong but I think the main thing is that we just needed to think and discuss things a little bit, he added. I was told on numerous occasions \u0027you are not an epidemiologist, shut up\u0027. I don\u0027t really care. I was just looking at the numbers. I was looking at the cruise ship, looking at Wuhan. The same number held for these places.The virus has saturated, he believes, across Europe. I think the lockdown will cause much more damage than the deaths saved, he added. When I saw the briefing (from Prof Ferguson) I was shocked. I had a run-in with him when I actually saw that Ferguson\u0027s death rate was a year\u0027s worth - doubling the normal death rate. I saw that and said immediately that\u0027s completely wrong. I think Ferguson over-estimated 10 or 12 times. We should have seen from China that a virus never grows exponentially. From the very first case you see, exponential growth actually slows down very dramatically.The problem with epidemiologists is that they feel their job is to frighten people into lockdown, social distancing. So you say \u0027there\u0027s going to be a million deaths\u0027 and when there are only 25,000 you say \u0027it\u0027s good you listened to my advice\u0027. This happened with Ebola and bird flu. It\u0027s just part of the madness.Prof Levitt says the global evidence shows the virus fades in dry heat and in much of the western world there seems to be some kind of immunity. The main worry I would have would be in China, he said when asked about the prospect of a second outbreak. I am 73 and I feel very young, he added. I don\u0027t care about the risk at all. As you get old the risk of dying from disease is so high that this is the time to buy a motorcycle, go skiing!More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"militant unions facing moment political jeopardy not pm","story":"If the Government loses its nerve over relaxing the lockdown in June then its credibility, along with much of the economy, is finished. Boris Johnson’s leadership, whose most fundamental principle was confidence and belief in the fortitude of our national character, will never recover. Whatever contradictions or confusions there may have been in the run-up to this critical moment will probably fall away in the great struggle for recovery that will dominate all our tomorrows – but a cave-in over the first positive step out of this mess will never be forgotten.The enemy clearly believes it is on to a winner, exploiting the anxiety that the government itself stoked with such stupendous success. The trade unions are getting ready to party like it was 1979, and their refusal to cooperate can be accompanied by the most morally daunting argument in the world. After all, you (the politicians) said it yourselves: this is a matter of life and death. Any degree of risk must be too great. If you fail to stay at home you are, by definition, threatening the safety of the most vulnerable in society.As Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, put it last week, “there is nothing more fundamental than people staying healthy and safe”. Which, of course, is precisely what government officials have been saying all along. So you can’t impugn our position because it is based on your own message as promulgated until a few days ago. We are simply taking you at your earlier word – which suited us very well as it happens.I can see why, at first glance anyway, this might be a difficult stance to counter. After all, who wants to look as if he is being reckless about a threat to other people’s lives? Even if you grant that the economic consequences of an indefinite lockdown will also eventually be fatal, that doesn’t quite have the impact of deaths occurring right here and right now.But the logic of the any-risk-is-too-great argument as offered most notably by the teaching unions – and also embraced rather less plausibly by railway drivers and various public sector lobbies – has an inherent vulnerability. What if most, or even a good many, schools do succeed in opening their classrooms to that first intake of children who have now become pawns in a political power struggle – and nothing terrible happens?What if there is no increase in cases, no new spike in the epidemic, no increased incidence of hospital admissions? Then what? Will the teaching unions and the headteachers’ organisations, and the Labour councils that have sworn to support their non-cooperation pact, be prepared to say they got it wrong? Almost certainly not. They will say something like, “We are now (after ten days, or two weeks, or a month) confident that there is little or no risk to our members and their families, so we shall open our schools but only provisionally and with the most rigorous precautions in place, blah-blah.” But they will open the schools. And we need say no more about it.They will not, in other words, be able to hold out against either the clear evidence that re-opening has not resulted in catastrophe, or the moral and social pressure to make schooling available to their own pupils when it is being offered in so many other places.This would be the least explosive way to resolve this. Let the most intransigent elements persevere with their non-cooperation until it reaches a point of unsustainability. Let them defend their position until it becomes indefensible. Many of the noisiest spokesmen are motor mouth political activists who are being given inordinate amounts of media coverage – by those who oppose them as much as those who support them – and are thus having a disproportionate effect on public opinion.Those opinion polls that show majorities of parents opposed to schools reopening are about as reliable as the polls taken before elections that say that nobody is going to vote Conservative. Ordinary people tell opinion pollsters whatever they believe (because they have been told by the media) it is acceptable to say. In fact, the broadcast news media are making precisely the same mistake now that they did when Islamist fundamentalism first appeared on the scene: shoving a microphone under the nose of every hothead who clamours for attention no matter how unrepresentative he (or she) might be, and thus allowing a fringe view to pose as mainstream opinion.But when apprehensive parents see other people’s children skipping off to school without any cataclysmic consequences, they will get over their reluctance very quickly. And, as a matter of interest, they will be grateful that the Government went ahead with its plan. All of this could be handled with delicacy and tact: no shame, no blame.Should the unions attempt to dig in, to insist somehow that even avoiding any early signs of a virus uptick isn’t reassuring enough because there is still the chance of a second wave in the autumn or winter, that would be the moment for the government to get heavy. How long a wait is long enough? When does reasonable caution become unacceptable intransigence?This applies to the lockdown generally too: if new cases fall to negligible numbers over the next month, will there still be influential voices insisting that crucial elements of lockdown such as social distancing (which is one of the most psychologically and economically damaging measures) be maintained? For how long? Indefinitely? Until there is a vaccine (which may be never)?If the teachers (and maybe the train and tube drivers) stick with their opposition, they will be discredited. And they might even end up breaking the law. Because an outright refusal to work under any circumstances is a strike – and calling a strike without holding a ballot of your members is illegal. I doubt that even the bellicose Leftists who claim to speak for the teaching profession will want to go there.So pull yourself together Boris – you don’t need to declare war and you don’t need to retreat. It is the other side that is in political jeopardy.    More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"museums considering exhibits children can smell rather touch","story":"Museums are considering exhibits children can smell rather than touch to adhere to new safety rules to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Instead of the standard hands-on displays which would be easily contaminated and impractical to clean, curious young visitors could more safely be immersed in scent.Covid-19 has left museums across the country closed and curators are pondering how to responsibly welcome the public back when they reopen, with social distancing and other measures almost certainly in place.While adults could obey the rules, children could struggle to refrain from touching, particularly when the kind of interactive exhibits seen in the Science or Natural History Museum are meant to be played with.Experts on child-friendly attractions have suggested that handing out gloves and constantly scrubbing exhibits after youngsters have their fun would be impractical, and other senses should be invoked instead to capture their imagination.Campaigners at Kids in Museums have suggested that the Jorvik Viking Centre, where crackling fires conjure Dark Age aromas, shows how smell could replace touch in virus-conscious museums.The attraction in York has previously experimented with bottling scents our ancestors encountered, including incense, aged leather, rotting meat and the communal cesspit.“Smell is already used to great effect at some venues,” said Alison Bowyer, director of Kids in Museums, which advises on making attractions child-friendly.  Experts said that before the coronavirus pandemic, hands-on and interactive exhibits were important for family-friendly museum visits, with many sites across the country catering for children with displays that could hold their attention.  Social distancing and cleaning will both likely be key elements in any safe reopening  of museums to families, which will reduce capacity and potential ticket sales, but also present challenges for staff keeping display virus-free.  Ms Bowyer said: “It is not going to be sustainable for all museums to regularly clean or offer gloves for interactives, so it is likely that many venues will take these out of service and make areas no touch.”  She added that the sector is now: “Thinking about how other senses rather than touch can enhance families’ enjoyment of visiting.”  The successful smells of Jorvik could be a model for enticing youthful interest in science and history in touch-free museums, and more technological innovations could hold wavering attention s.  The use of virtual reality and other visually stimulating media has been suggested to bring exhibitions to life, with tablets and personal devices used to inject child-friendly fun into exhibitions without the need to touch strange surfaces.  Audio guides have also been discussed as a means to educate safely in galleries rocked by Covid-19, along with paper trails and maps parents can take away.  For museums which receive less grant funding and are dependent on ticket sales for exhibitions, providing a desirable option for parents emerging from lockdown could be financially important.  Campaigners hope that museums will continue to offer interactive attractions families will feel safe using while virus worries linger.  Ms Bowyer said:  “We are working with museums to ensure families are represented in conversations about reopening and can still expect a high-quality experience.  “We know many families already worry about how to behave in museums, so we want to make sure new measures don’t increase isions between those who feel comfortable visiting and those who don’t.  “Though they will have to adapt, there is so much that museums can still offer families: a warm welcome.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national interest dominic cummings stay","story":"It is hardly a revelation that Dominic Cummings has many enemies who believe he should be sacked for his alleged infringement of the lockdown rules. He has become a lightning conductor for the anger of a good slice of progressive Britain. They want revenge, above all for Brexit.But the Cummings question raises another interesting question about what, if any, special privileges should be enjoyed by the people running the country on our behalf. There is a kind of hyper-democratic rancour abroad that refuses to contemplate that our rulers, at least while they are ruling, deserve some special treatment.I do not know Mr Cummings personally (and voted Remain in the referendum). Even his fans concede that he can be erratic, and it is reassuring to see, in several decisions that the Government made before the crisis, that his influence is not as great as his enemies imagine. But he is obviously highly capable, science and data literate, and understands many of the failings of the government machine that have been revealed by the crisis (see his 2014 IPPR lecture, “The Hollow Men”). I think it is in the national interest that he stays.   And his case surely sits in a defensible grey zone. Both he and his wife were ill with the virus, placing their child in a vulnerable position. Short of handing the child to social services, it is hard to see what course of action they could have taken but to fall back on family in Durham. And they were, according to reports, fortunate to have the space in Durham to isolate away from Mr Cummings’s parents in a separate cottage, safe in the knowledge they could now rely on family help. They applied human common sense, and their case is in a completely different category to Professor Neil Ferguson’s romantic liaison, or Catherine Calderwood, the former Scottish chief medical officer, who decided to visit her second home. Both of those breaches of lockdown were completely unforced.In general, of course, the law should apply equally to all, and members of the ruling elite should avoid saying one thing and doing another. But there is also widespread agreement that our rulers, and by extension their closest advisers, are entitled to some special treatment. They are, after all, special people, even in democracies – perhaps especially in democracies – and have a very unusual and demanding job, which we want them to perform to the best of their abilities. Boris Johnson clearly did not get normal treatment at St Thomas’ Hospital. Politicians have bodyguards and, to cite a more trivial example, their cars often have police escorts and sail through red lights to get ministers and their advisers to meetings on time. We do, and should, bend the rules for them. The question is, which actions sit legitimately in that ruler privilege zone and which do not? We decided, for example, a few years back, that awarding yourself overgenerous expenses did not (without telling them). There is an anti-elitist piety, often expressed by the academic or media branch of the same broad elite, that refuses to accept the specialness of rulers. I sometimes think that the combination of mass higher education and social media threatens to make society ungovernable. The broad elite is in revolt against the narrow elite. Everyone thinks they know better. We have seen this in freedom of information rules that make it difficult for ministers and officials to have honest conversations, pushing key decisions into private rabbit-holes. (Though it’s a shame the rules were not applied to the scientific advice being given to ministers, where open critique of the science from other scientists would have been useful.)We want transparent, open government, but it has negative unintended consequences that need to be constrained. The transparency requirements of modern institutions encourage a performative, virtue-signalling political culture that makes it harder for people to identify as establishment insiders and come to reasonable compromises.So it’s important that Mr Cummings stays. Even if his actions were technically outside the letter of the law – which is far from clear – there is, surely, an extreme circumstances loophole, and more broadly we need to cut our rulers (and their top advisers) some slack. David Goodhart is author of ‘The Road to Somewhere’ (Penguin)More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"next two months lockdown questions answered","story":"Two months ago, Britain went into lockdown. Our freedoms were curtailed, and the simple pleasures we have known of socialising with friends and family, walking along a beach or playing a game of five-a-side in the park stopped overnight. Life was put on hold. Now, with a gradual easing of the measures, there is the tantalising prospect of a return to some sort of normality. But how much will life go back to the way it was? Here, with the help of our team of  writers, we try to explain what the next two months of lockdown will look like. The hot weather as we enter summer brings with it thoughts of BBQs and beers with friends and family, but although people are able to have BBQs in their garden, these can only involve members of their own household at the moment. Mass gatherings and visiting friends or family are still prohibited in England, Scotland and Wales, meaning BBQs with friends and family are not permitted. Loosening restrictions will depend on which stage the Government’s five-level alert system is at - the more the virus is contained, the more rules will be relaxed. Currently Britain is transitioning from level 4 to level 3. Scotland hopes to move to phase one of its own exit roadmap after May 28. Meetings of two households will be allowed in small numbers, which would permit BBQs in gardens under this arrangement and with physical distancing. Larger groups from two different households will be permitted to meet outside under phase two later in the year.Elsewhere, ministers are hoping to continue to ease measures in the coming weeks and months, meaning BBQs with people outside of someone’s immediate household could be a possibility by the August bank holiday. Relaxations are to be assessed on a fortnightly basis, and socially-distanced BBQs could be permitted in line with the safe reopening of bars and restaurants, currently scheduled for July 4.One model currently being implemented in other countries is that of ‘social bubbles’, where people are able to spend time with a maximum number of people from outside their household. It is advised that this takes place in gardens or on terraces where possible.In Belgium, each household is currently allowed to invite up to four guests, all of whom are expected to remain 1.5 metres apart and observe other preventative measures such as regular hand-washing. If a similar policy were to be introduced in Britain, it would mean you could have a socially-distant barbecue with a limited number of friends or relatives.As bars and restaurants across the world reopen (Italians were allowed to eat out last Monday for the first time in months), Britons are asking themselves when they’ll be able to get in on the act. Many of our pubs and restaurants have begun tentatively reopening – for takeaway and delivery only. These include high-street chains such as McDonald\u0027s, which has started reopening its drive-thru restaurants in large numbers.So when will we be able to eat and drink inside a pub or restaurant? The latest official advice is that “at least some” hospitality venues will be able to reopen from July 4 at the earliest, as part of the next phase of the lockdown exit plan, but only if the number of infections and deaths continues on the same trajectory. However, the experience is likely to be very different to pre-Covid days, according to the latest draft guidelines. Safety measures may include no bar service (and no drinking at the bar) PPE for staff no salt and pepper shakers or table menus cashless service and tables restricted to household members. At all food and drink establishments, some form of social distancing is likely to be in place, although the British Beer and Pub Association is pushing for the current two-metre recommended distance to be reduced to one metre (in line with WHO guidelines), which would allow businesses to serve a much larger number of customers. Many restaurants operate within tight margins, and some industry figures have warned that it may not be viable to open for business if they are forced to keep their premises half empty.However, if the Government listens to the recommendations of Sunetra Gupta, Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology at the University of Oxford, the hospitality industry could be back to normal much sooner than expected. She suggested this week that pubs and restaurants could reopen tomorrow without posing the threat of a second wave of coronavirus. It\u0027s safe to say your trip will not be business as usual - we\u0027ve outlined in depth what will change here. The furlough scheme has been a life raft keeping millions of Britons from plunging into financial hardship during the pandemic - but the Government has made it clear that it cannot afford to keep it running indefinitely. More than eight million people are now furloughed and are receiving their wages via the Job Retention Scheme, costing the Government £11.1 billion so far. Hundreds of thousands of extra workers have been added every week since the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, pledged to pay 80 per cent of people’s wages up to £2,500 a month. Despite the generous support package, more than two million are already jobless and there are fears that this figure will continue on its upwards trend throughout the summer. Mr Sunak has extended the furlough scheme by four months to the end of October, but then businesses will have to make tough decisions for the future of their employees and many could find themselves out of a job.From the start of August, the scheme will become more flexible, allowing employees to bring furloughed employees back part-time.Workers will continue to receive the same level of support at 80 per cent of their current salary up to £2,500 a month, but employers will need to share the burden of paying salaries with the Government. Further details are yet to be published but are expected for the end of May. Your employer can end your furlough period at any time if they need you back at work, so long as you have been away for more than three weeks.  They can also make you redundant when you are on furlough. If you feel that you would like to extend your furlough period because you are at risk, there is nothing stopping you from asking. But remember employers have no obligation to enact this. If they do ask you to go back into work but you need to self-isolate then you will have to claim statutory sick pay.You may find that you are put on furlough until the very end of the scheme, at which point your employer will either get you back to work or could make you redundant. If you do find yourself being made redundant, you may be eligible for certain things, including redundancy pay, a notice period, a consultation with your employer, the option to move into a different job and time off to find a new job. You can then look into applying for universal credit and jobseeker’s allowance. Despite an increase in companies promoting flexible working over the past decade, just 5 per cent of Britain’s 33 million employees mainly worked from home last year, according to ONS data, with an additional 27 per cent occasionally doing so.This has risen since the Covid-19 outbreak, with 44.6 per cent of workers surveyed by the ONS saying they had worked from home during one week in April.Post-Covid, employment lawyers believe it will be difficult for companies to refuse applications from staff wishing to work from home. A law change in Britain in 2014 means that employees have the right to make one “flexibility request” per year, regardless of their reasons for doing so, and the employer has a legal duty to consider it. Previously, the law stated that only parents of children under 16 or those registered as carers were allowed to request flexible working.Those who do go back to the office, through choice or necessity, will face a very different environment to what they’re accustomed to. Office spaces will be considerably downsized as employers seek to cut costs, social distancing requirements mean floor markings and plastic screens will be installed, while some firms are considering additional methods such as using thermal imaging screens in their reception areas to determine the body temperature of anyone entering the building.Staff are likely to work in shift patterns spread over a seven-day working week, with offices half occupied to ensure sufficient distance between colleagues.When might workers return to the office? It could be a while yet. Boris Johnson has encouraged people who cannot work from home, such as those in construction or manufacturing, to return to work now. However, an email addressed to civil servants and disclosed by Sky News explained that those currently working from home could still be doing so for another six to 12 months.Sally Peck, Family and Education Editor The next two months will bring us to what would be the end of this academic year for schools. But it will look nothing like summer term as we have known it.The Government roadmap calls for the ‘conditional’ reopening of primary schools from June 1, beginning with children in Reception, and Years 1 and 6, but in smaller class sizes to ensure that social distancing can be implemented. All primary-aged children will return to school “before the summer for a month if feasible”, the dossier adds, although it acknowledges this will be determined by whether coronavirus cases stay low. However, on May 20, just a week and a half before schools are set to open their doors, the Justice Secretary acknowledged that the country is ided over the reopening of schools. And teaching unions have responded with a list of demands before they advise their members to return to work. Many parents have said that they will not send their children back to school until September at the earliest, and it seems unlikely that most primary or secondary pupils will spend much time in classrooms in June or July.Few secondary pupils will see the inside of a classroom over the next two months: while Years 10 and 12 were told to prepare for some “face-to-face contact”, as these groups are one year away from sitting crucial GCSE and A-level exams, the rest are unlikely to return.And for any children who do return, it’s pretty clear that they won’t be getting a normal experience: teachers won’t be delivering the normal curriculum to small groups of children they’re more likely to be focusing on emotional resilience, doing what they can to prepare young people for a different phase of education.Private schools operate independently and may make their own decisions about when to return to the classroom, but the vast majority have followed government guidelines for state schools, and intend to keep the bulk of children learning online for the rest of this academic year.Universities are continuing to operate from a distance through the end of their terms in June, and some have said that lectures will remain online-only when students start the new academic year in autumn.Oliver Smith, Assistant Head of Travel The Government’s “strategy” on post-lockdown travel has been an utter shambles. It is almost June and still we have no clear idea about whether we will be able to go on an overseas holiday this summer. UK airlines, including easyJet and BA, are getting ready to resume services (don’t forget your face mask), and over in Europe, there are signs of hope. Greece (which will welcome visitors to Athens from June 15, and to its islands from July 1), Italy (which will kickstart tourism on June 3) and Spain (where the sector is planning a late June relaunch) are all easing travel restrictions. But in Britain, we are closing the door. After weeks without guidance, Boris Johnson dropped a bombshell on May 10 when he signalled that the UK was preparing to impose a two-week period of self-isolation on all international arrivals, including returning holidaymakers. This bizarre decision, a fine example of shutting the door (two months) after the horse has bolted, has been widely ridiculed. The peak is long gone, Covid cases across Europe are rapidly disappearing, and our neighbours are opening their doors - so why the devil are we raising the drawbridge?It is also unworkable. Fines of £1,000 have been threatened for those who break the rules, and police say they will carry out 100 spot checks a day. But with Heathrow alone handling 80 million passengers a year, the odds of being caught look exceptionally slim. Furthermore, Ireland, as part of the Common Travel Area, is exempt from the policy. So holidaymakers could simply fly to the Costa del Sol via Dublin and dodge the quarantine. Grant Shapps added to the confusion with his “air bridges” proposal, and in the meantime, with the Foreign Office still issuing its indefinite ban on travel, tour operators and airlines are slowly sinking under a tide of refund requests. As for UK holidays, struggling hotels, campsites and B\u0026ampBs are clinging to the prospect of a July 4 restart. The Prime Minister has said that some hospitality businesses should be able to reopen from then, but detail is severely lacking and the “stay away” attitudes of regional authorities are far from encouraging. So what will happen in the next 60 days? Even if a quarantine is put in place, most are predicting it will only last a matter of weeks, or be replaced by more nuanced restrictions on arrivals from certain destinations. As for the Foreign Office advice against overseas travel, it was introduced when countries around the world began putting restrictions on overseas arrivals. So it seems reasonable to assume that, once destinations begin welcoming tourists, those advisories will be lifted one by one.Therefore, an overseas July or August holiday remains an outside possibility. But the idea of millions of us crowding into airports, packing onto flights and heading for teeming beaches and buzzing bars and restaurants of the Med seems very unlikely.Flights will be slow to restart, and many of us will be reticent to travel. Those that get away may find some cracking deals, but their holiday will be a strange one: expect temperature checks in airports, mandatory face masks on planes, and social distancing in museums and restaurants. A trip to a remote national park might be more appealing than a city break. And, while some Caribbean islands like St Lucia are tentatively reopening to tourists, long-haul travel looks unlikely until much later in the year.In terms of domestic travel, I’d be shocked if hotels - or, at the very least, campsites and self-catering properties - are not given the green light to reopen in July. Firms are already reporting a surge in summer bookings and staycations are already happening in many European countries (and without any sign of an uptick in coronavirus cases).Should the Government decide to block UK holidays as well as foreign ones this summer, while the rest of Europe is enjoying seaside breaks, it should expect some very disgruntled citizens. Hairdressers are provisionally set to open on July 4, along with other hospitality services. Although there are no firm rules on how they\u0027ll have to reopen, it’s likely given the close-contact nature of salons that they’ll have to operate under strict social distancing rules.For your first visit back into a hairdresser in July, every appointment will have to be made online or over the phone, you’ll probably be required to wear a mask and some services such as blow-dries will likely be off the menu, too. Your hairdresser will be wearing full PPE and you may have to pre-pay for your appointment from home, to limit contact. Here are eight things to expect on your first visit back. If you’re keen on a haircut as soon as your hairdresser reopens, many have started waiting lists on their websites, so get it touch. Bethan Holt, Director of Fashion News and Features DirectorThe good news is that you can still shop online now - and that’s been a lifeline for retailers big and small - but there’s certainly nothing quite like a trip to the shops. The government has announced that non-essential retailers, like fashion stores, can begin to re-open from June 1. And many are preparing to do just that. The queues and crowds which formed outside the likes of Zara and TJ Maxx in Europe and the US last week show many of us are eager to get back to browsing.But the truth is, it’s not going to be like a shopping trip of yore - no more piling into a changing room with piles to try on, crowding around the tills to check out and browsing in big groups.  Most retailers will keep changing rooms closed, with social distancing measures in place and hand sanitizer free-flowing. There are ingenious tech solutions in the offing to help keep hygiene standards high - clothes will be frequently steamed or treated with UV lights to kill germs. Not all shops will be open from the start of June. Luxe knitwear retailer Brora says it plans to start with its shops in the North first while footwear label Kurt Geiger will open just 10-20 of its outposts at first. It says that the safety measures it’s bringing in will cost £75,000 per year, per store.If you’re nervous about the prospect of hitting the shops, then smaller boutiques and independent retailers still have plenty of solutions. At Me + Em, you can book in styling sessions via Zoom, and the Notting Hill boutique Couverture and the Garbstore has offered out of hours private shopping appointments for anyone not wishing to share a confined space with other customers. Many more local boutiques are considering equally ingenious ways to enable devotees to shop safely.  Still have questions before heading to the shops? Our experts have answered your questions. The Government’s roadmap for leaving lockdown makes it clear that the reopening of gyms comes some way down the line, after outdoor spaces such as tennis clubs and golf clubs, where the risk of transmission is far lower.The document says it is the Government\u0027s ambition to start reopening other leisure facilities from July 4 at the earliest, but stresses that it is likely that reopening indoor public spaces such as leisure centres and gyms, along with venues that attract large crowds like sports stadia, may only be possible significantly later, depending on the reduction in numbers of infections.Though gyms remain closed, people are now permitted to exercise outside as many times each day as they wish since coronavirus is less likely to spread outdoors. Outdoor gyms and playgrounds remain closed, since there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces.Can\u0027t picture how gyms would work with social distancing measures? We take a look here. At present, wedding ceremonies are not taking place in the UK. While the Government has not yet announced its plans for ceremonies going forward, they get a brief mention in the “Our Plan to Rebuild” dossier: “The Government is also examining how to enable people to gather in slightly larger groups to better facilitate small weddings.” Exactly how small these ceremonies will be has yet to be decided.If you have a wedding planned in June, July or August, should you postpone? “Absolutely,” says wedding planner Katrina Otter, because the “guidelines are still uncertain.” Most of Otter’s clients have postponed to September or next year.While Otter is “hopeful for September onwards”, she says it might be safer to postpone your wedding until 2021. “The issue is that, yes, it might be that the weddings are allowed to take place but with social distancing measures in place,” she says. “There is also the very real risk that if we go over the R value, that we will suddenly be told we’re going back to isolation – and the wedding’s tomorrow. There’s always that ‘what if?’ hanging over the couple.”Some couples might opt for “alternative” ceremonies on Zoom, even when the restrictions are lifted, but this won\u0027t suit everyone. “It’s going to work for some couples,” Otter says. “It’s definitely not going to work for the majority.”From booking bigger venues to socially distanced ceremonies, here\u0027s what future brides and grooms can expect on their big day. Scientists in the UK and across the globe are working at an unprecedented pace to develop diagnostics, treatments and vaccines to tackle the coronavirus - and good news is starting to emerge in all three areas.In the UK swab tests, to determine if a person has an active Covid-19 infection, are now available for everyone over the age of five, while the Government this week signed contracts with Roche Diagnostics and Abbott Laboratories to roll out 10 million antibody blood tests in the coming months. These tests are used to determine whether someone has been infected in the past and will help track the prevalence of the virus across the country.From next week these will be offered to some NHS and care staff in England, plus certain patients and care residents. While experts believe that the presence of antibodies in our blood is likely to confer immunity to Covid-19, this is yet to be confirmed.On treatments, the focus has been on repurposing existing drugs and some - such as an antiviral called remdesivir - have shown promise. Experts are eagerly awaiting the upcoming results of three ‘mega-trials’ - including the Recovery trial in the UK, for more conclusive evidence. This could come as soon as the end of June.The final, most critical, tool is a vaccine. Currently more than 100 candidates are in development globally, with at least eight already being tested in people.This week Moderna, an American biotech, announced promising early results of a safety trial of its vaccine in eight volunteers. In the UK, Imperial College and Oxford University are both developing vaccines that are seen as the front runners, with the latter now entering the second phase of human trials.AstraZeneca and Oxford will produce 100 million doses of their vaccine, including 30million for the UK, which they claim could be available by September - but even if we have a safe, effective vaccine it could take months and months to manufacture at scale. Experts have also warned against over-optimism. While the majority say there is a “good chance” that a vaccine will be developed, there is no guarantee.For English property, the next two months will be a process of adjustment. The Government’s surprise reopening of the housing market on May 13 means that buyers can go to house viewings, sellers can list properties and agents are reopening their offices. The new guidance is complex. Sellers must clean surfaces, open doors, provide places for buyers to wash their hands and then ideally vacate their homes for viewings. In two months’ time, virtual viewing technology will have boomed. Surveyors, valuers and conveyancers will have returned employees from furlough and should have made headway through the backlog that built up over the seven-week freeze.The rules are different in the other countries that make up the UK. The Scottish Government has said the property market there should be able to reopen from June 18. It is reasonable to assume that Wales and Northern Ireland’s housing markets are likely to follow similar timelines, but for now all three markets are shut. Anyone thinking about moving house in the coming months should be wary of the fact that the market could be suspended again. There is a note in the English Government’s guidance that sales could be refrozen if the coronavirus outbreak does not stay under control.Buyers in the English market are already trying hard to renegotiate big discounts, in light of the Bank of England’s expectation that house prices could fall by 16 per cent. Knight Frank estimates that values have dipped by 5 per cent  since lockdown began. But even in two months, the economic impact of coronavirus and rising unemployment on prices will not be fully felt. There are two protective cushions around house prices. The furlough scheme, which is supporting the wages of nearly eight million people, and mortgage holidays, which are currently being used by one in seven households. When these end, more sellers will be under pressure to accept low-ball offers. But for now, both schemes have been extended until the autumn. In July, the real problems for the housing market will still be yet to come.Britain is in the deepest recession for 300 years. The lockdown has closed swathes of the economy, furloughed 8million workers, and left the survival of entire industries in doubt.But businesses are fighting back. Factories and construction sites have led the way in working out how to reopen safely. Shops are planning to spring back to life with social distancing in place. Office staff have proved remarkably adaptable to working from the kitchen table. It means the very worst could be over already.Around one-third of the economy was closed in April, so the gradual reopening means growth should return tentatively into May. GDP fell by 2 per cent in the first quarter and is set to fall by as much as 20 per cent in the second quarter, matching the usual definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP.With the reopening going ahead, that means this extreme recession will be over almost as soon as it began. That is the good news.The bad news is that it will take far longer to get the economy back up to its pre-coronavirus size. Jobs and businesses can still rely on government support for now.But that will not last forever. From August employers will be expected to chip in to the cost of furloughing their workers.That means they have two months to draw up plans to pay those costs, with more firms reopening to test out customer demand, and their ability to cope with social distancing.The hospitality trade, for instance, expects to be able to reopen with around 30 per cent of its usual capacity, with limits on the number of customers and staff allowed in at any one time.By the end of the year the industry expects to get up to the 60 per cent or so of usual revenues which should enable most firms to break even.But that is a long time to operate at a loss, and might mean more staff are laid off. The strain on businesses and family finances is just beginning, even if the ‘official’ recession may soon be over.The UK and the EU\u0027s visions for the future trading relationship after Brexit are so different, there is little optimism that the next two months will bring a breakthrough. The last round of trade negotiations ended in acrimony and mutual recrimination last week.Britain has responded by publishing its draft trade deal and fisheries agreement, which are negotiating documents that had been secret until now. Relations are chilly.  What is on offer is not a fair free trade agreement between close economic partners but a relatively low quality trade agreement coming with unprecedented EU oversight of our laws and institutions, David Frost, the UK\u0027s chief negotiator, wrote to Michel Barnier on Tuesday.The two sides are particularly ided over fishing and the EU\u0027s demand for level playing field guarantees. The deadline to finalise the trade deal is the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of the year. Unless the deal is struck or the transition period is extended, which has been ruled out by Downing Street, the UK will be trading on less advantageous WTO terms with its major trading partner from Jan 1. The clock is ticking and the coronavirus pandemic has slowed the negotiations, forcing them online and at one point both chief negotiators into quarantine. The next crunch point is June when the UK and EU meet to evaluate progress and potentially discuss extension. There is one negotiating round in June before the high level meeting but with both sides telling the other they need to change their red lines, there seems no chance of the impasse being broken. UK sources have suggested they could walk away from the negotiating table if not enough progress is made and begin preparing for no deal. Suggestions that Boris Johnson could get personally involved in the talks and EU leaders could intervene to break the deadlocked negotiations are treated cautiously in Brussels. Diplomats point out that the June EU summit, where any compromise could be agreed by the bloc\u0027s heads of state and government, will be dominated by a brewing row over how best to kickstart Europe\u0027s economic recovery after coronavirus. German football’s Bundesliga was the first major European sports league back earlier this month and there are plans across English sport for a gradual and restricted resumption of competition in June and July.The Government has published ‘Step One’ proposals for returning to training and some sports, including Premier League football teams, began socially distanced training this week. The players and staff will be tested twice a week for Covid-19 and clubs hope to move imminently to full contact training before then resuming matches from around the middle of June. Matches, though, would be held without crowds and fans are unlikely to be permitted at matches until at least 2021. This leaves huge doubt over the financial viability of football at every level below the Premier League, which is largely funded by broadcast income.Other sports are also working towards their return. England’s cricket series this summer against the West Indies and India are still being planned without fans, rugby union hopes to begin its Premiership in July while golf’s European Tour intends to stage five tournaments in England and Wales this summer.June is the earliest that any sport can resume and the first back is likely to be snooker, who are planning an 11-day tournament on ITV from June 1 that will be staged without fans in Milton Keynes.  All players, staff and contractors must return a negative coronavirus test prior to entering the venue, which has been selected because there is accommodation on site. Horse racing also plans to resume without fans at Newcastle on June 1, just a few hours after the Championship League Snooker begins.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford university covid 19 vaccine trial has 50 per cent chance","story":"It began in January as a “little lab project” after a curious new disease emerged in China.Little more than four months later, the eyes of the nation - and perhaps the world - are firmly upon Professor Adrian Hill and his team at Oxford University.This week, the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca announced a $1.2 billion deal with the US government to produce 400 million doses of the unproven coronavirus vaccine first produced in Prof Hill\u0027s Oxford lab.Meanwhile, the British Government has agreed to pay for up to 100 million doses, adding that 30 million may be ready for UK citizens by September.The stakes could hardly be higher. If proven effective, the ZD1222 vaccine would allow people to leave their homes, go back to work, and rebuild the economy.But Professor Hill, director of the university’s Jenner Institute, revealed that his team now faces a major problem, throwing the September deadline into doubt.In short, their adversary is disappearing so rapidly in the UK that the next phase of trials has only a 50 per cent chance of success.Without Covid-19 spreading in the community, volunteers will not catch the disease, leaving scientists unable to prove that their vaccine makes any difference.Professor Hill said that of 10,000 people recruited to test the vaccine in the coming weeks - some of whom will be given a placebo - he expected fewer than 50 people to catch the virus. If fewer than 20 test positive, then the results may be useless, he warned.“It is a race, yes. But it\u0027s not a race against the other guys. It\u0027s a race against the virus disappearing, and against time,” Professor Hill, 61, told the  from his university laboratory, long emptied by the lockdown.“We said earlier in the year that there was an 80 per cent chance of developing an effective vaccine by September.“But at the moment, there’s a 50 per cent chance that we get no result at all.“We’re in the bizarre position of wanting Covid to stay, at least for a little while. But cases are declining.At the Downing Street press conference on May 17, Business Secretary Alok Sharma suggested half the UK population could be given the jab this autumn, should it prove effective.But Prof Hill said success was far from guaranteed, and warned against “over-promising”.“I wouldn’t book a holiday in October on the back of these announcements, put it that way,” he said.“The number keeps going up. Thirty million doses is quite hard, and one hundred million is harder still by September. Remember, even if we get a result in August, we can\u0027t start vaccinating everyone the next day.” “There’s a danger of over-promising here. This is the way I usually say it: this is our ambition. There are multiple risks. It\u0027s never been done before. We don\u0027t know if we can do it. We think we can. You know, mistakes happen. Accidents happen in cooking as well. That needs to be understood.”Early next month, Oxford will release the crucial results of a first trial of more than 1,000 UK volunteers conducted in April, when the disease was at its peak.“The first trial is going fine. We’re still in business, I can tell you that,” Prof Hill said.“But we’re not going to do what others have done - say we’ve got something good, but we’re not showing you yet. That’s just bonkers. You either disclose your results or you don’t.”Around the world, eight potential Covid-19 vaccines have gone to human trials: four in China, two in the US, and one in Germany. Many of those teams - including Oxford - are planning to move their next trials to Covid-19 hotspots overseas, but that will take time. The Oxford team has already arranged further trials in the US, and are in talks with other countries where the virus is still spreading.“You think we\u0027ve got a problem? Prof Hill said. What would you do if you were in China? There are three Chinese companies looking for phase three and there’s no Covid in China. So what do they do?The Oxford team had a strong head start on their rivals. Most of the other scientists searching for a vaccine across the world have been forced to hold small clinical trials to prove their treatment is safe. But the Jenner Institute already had a vaccine tested against an earlier coronavirus, which was proven to be harmless to humans.The technique grew from Prof Hill’s search for a vaccine to combat malaria, a scourge he first witnessed in the 1980s while visiting an uncle working as a priest in a war-torn part of modern Zimbabwe.Over the past two decades, the Jenner Institute learned how to alter the genetic code of a familiar virus, first to neutralise its harmful effects, and then to make it imitate a deadlier disease. Injected into the bloodstream, the harmless virus can induce the body to produce an immune response, providing long-lasting protection.Prof Hill\u0027s long search for a viable malaria vaccine has so far been fruitless, despite more than 70 clinical trials. But last year, his colleague Professor Sarah Gilbert modified the same chimpanzee virus to vaccinate against MERS, a coronavirus, which then passed human trials in the UK. When Covid-19 began to spread, Prof Gilbert decided to do a “little lab project” to see whether the Oxford technique could work on the new disease. Tests were promising, and in April six rhesus macaque monkeys were given single doses of the Oxford vaccine at a US lab, and were then exposed to the virus. A month later, all six monkeys were still healthy.If the next phase of human trials is a success, the Government has pledged that “people in the UK will get the first access, helping to protect thousands of lives”.Next in line will be the US government, which has secured 300m doses to protect its own citizens, under Donald Trump’s so-called ‘Warp Speed’ programme.But Prof Hill said Oxford University had secured “hardwired” assurances against so-called \u0027vaccine nationalism\u0027 - the prioritisation of treatment toward rich Western nations at the expense of others.“The reputational damage to the university would be enormous if we provided the vaccine only for the UK and US and not for the rest of those countries of the world where it\u0027s very likely the pandemic would still be raging,” he said.“I’ve been thinking about it day and night for weeks. We care about Africa. We know the people there. We know there\u0027s going to be a significant problem at some stage. Brazil looks terrible and India is getting there fast.“The vaccine should be supplied to the countries of greatest need at the moment that it works, rather than the countries who got there first. And that will happen.”A deal has already been signed with the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine producer. If the Oxford vaccine works, Prof Hill said he would be happy for other countries to use his research principles to protect their own citizens.“We might feel a little peculiar about that. We got there first, but everyone else piles in. We might feel that we\u0027ve done the heavy lifting. “But actually we wouldn\u0027t care. We\u0027re not competing in a cutthroat way. If someone else can produce a billion doses, we’ll have a party.”Despite the billion dollar price tag, Oxford will not be making vast amounts of money from the breakthrough, Prof Hill insisted.Simple arithmetic will tell you that there’s no money being made by the university. It’s pretty amazing that it can be manufactured at that selling price. We’re coming clean and saying: during the pandemic, we will not make money.” Until last week, the Oxford vaccine was considered the clear frontrunner in the global race. Last week, however, a widely-reported article in Forbes cast doubt on the results of the monkey trial, suggesting that results actually showed the vaccine did not prevent the animals from catching or spreading the virus because traces were found in the creatures’ noses.Prof Hill said the article was misleading because the monkeys had been deliberately “overdosed” on coronavirus in order to test for safety.“The honest truth, I think, is that the author is a long-retired senior Harvard virologist, infectious disease guy. He\u0027s not a vaccine developer,” he said.“We used a really high dose and these guys gave it not just into the lungs and the nose. They gave it into the mouth, and they gave it into the eyes. They gave a huge dose. I mean, seriously, it’s that level of basic.”Even so, Prof Hill accepts the chances of success still hang firmly in the balance.“The US government, the UK government, loads of charities and philanthropists are all saying we’ll pay to have it manufactured, before you finish the trial. I mean, it\u0027s a huge kind of vote of confidence in what we\u0027re doing. It\u0027s really flattering,” he said.“But that doesn\u0027t guarantee the result. It could be nothing or could be great or somewhere in between.We\u0027re conflicted. We believe in our technology, and I suppose we\u0027re more likely to overestimate than underestimate. “We try to be as objective as we can, but we spent 16 years developing this technology. If it suddenly looks like it might be useful to the whole world, you really want it to work.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"portrait nation lockdown telegraph readers share touching stories","story":"It has been two months since Boris Johnson put Britain into a full-scale lockdown, and there have been drastic changes to how we live our lives. Workplaces, restaurants and bars have had to shut their doors, and many people have not had any contact with their loved ones for months.We\u0027ve spoken to some of our readers to paint a picture of Britain during lockdown. We were told stories of heartbreak, loneliness and despair, but also tales of hope and compassion. Read on to see how the lives of your fellow readers have changed in lockdown and share your own stories in the comments section below.I was diagnosed with breast cancer only weeks before lockdown and I am totally alone in a small flat with no outside space. My GP has failed to identify me as vulnerable. I\u0027m dealing with chemotherapy and abject loneliness.The significant life-changing aspects of lockdown include the realisation that I am unimportant to even my immediate family. WhatsApp conversations are superficial. The effects of chemotherapy mean that eating and getting fresh fruit and vegetables is impossible except for the few days following a hallowed supermarket delivery.My finances are shot and will take some years to address. Years spent supporting everyone else now seem futile as no one else has stepped forward. I take a daily walk and in all these weeks only two people have smiled at me and one of those said hello, from a distance of course. A sign of things to come?With my compromised immune system, I am shielded from infections of all kinds. I can, and will, cope with what life is throwing at me. I have been supported to get to my treatment appointments by selfless community transport drivers who give me much-needed conversation if only for a few minutes.The most significant change has been that my mum celebrated her 100th birthday on May 16 and I couldn\u0027t even visit her in her care home. I was her carer for years before she had to go into the home at Christmas in 2015 and visits to her were the focus of my life.Paul Seymour, an NHS worker who caught coronavirus: Both my wife Joanne and I work in a hospital, she is a senior midwife and I am a clinical systems manager. When this crisis hit, I had just developed Covid-19 symptoms. At first, my symptoms were mild but it got a lot worse, so much so that I even recorded a \u0027farewell video\u0027 for my wife \u0027just in case\u0027.However, I was lucky enough to already have remote access to the hospital systems and, apart from one day when I felt so ill that I couldn\u0027t get out of bed at all, I was able to continue working. If I\u0027m honest, this also helped keep me occupied and active, with the added benefit that I could take breaks and relax whenever I felt fatigued and then resume working afterwards.Shortly after a period of isolation, I was told that I would need to work from home for three months. I have numerous health conditions, including angina, six coronary stents and diabetes, but I am expecting to return to work and the hospital on June 15.My wife of course has continued to work very long hours and has had to cancel her annual leave. The big change back for us, when it finally happens, will be the ability to finally get away from it all and relax, she has been tireless in her dedication and really needs a break away from it all!For me at least, \u0027lockdown\u0027 has been a mostly positive experience, which would not have been possible if the technology wasn\u0027t available. I\u0027ve also taken to trying to brighten things up during \u0027virtual meetings\u0027 – only with members of my own team of course!Every year the hospital hosts a staff awards ceremony.  I’m on the awards committee and I try to let my hair down each year, even though I don’t really have any nowadays. I really hope the event goes ahead this year as it will be needed more than ever as it celebrates the wonderful staff and all that they do - they’ve always been heroes to me.I am a single parent and full-time carer to my children. We go out and about a lot - to parks and playgrounds, the beach, swimming. All of our activities had to stop and all of a sudden we were protecting a vulnerable person in a dark house with no garden.All of our family coping strategies involve the freedom of outdoor space and the ability to shake off the rules, yet suddenly the outdoors became a danger zone where we couldn’t touch or play or mingle and an invisible threat surrounded us. I very much look forward to the day that we can once again fully immerse ourselves in the freedom of nature without the undercurrent of fear.The greatest positives for our family is the time we have had to play games and learn together. Without the rush and the scheduling we have done more as a threesome and the bond between siblings is growing as they turn to each other to play, in the absence of school, nursery and friends.For me, having never sewn in my life, I gave into an impulse to buy a sewing machine and have discovered a great pleasure in creating clothes for my children. It’s particularly satisfying to make things that are impossible to buy for my daughter, who has atypical proportions as a result of her disability. It would have been far easier to support my son’s emotions if he had had a safe place to let off steam rather than having to wait until we could leave the house for exercise. I think he has felt the most caged in and I have had moments of overwhelming, crushing claustrophobia.I was told to work from home ‘for the foreseeable future’ in March, due to being 13 weeks\u0027 pregnant, and I have been working from home ever since. My husband works in motorsport but was made redundant due to the factory closing down. He is a contractor so isn’t covered by any of the employee retention schemes.I work for the NHS so I am lucky that I can work from home and keep my job, but my life has changed dramatically forever as I am pregnant with a low income, an unemployed husband, three dogs to feed and a baby on the way. If my husband can’t get a job in the next two months, I fear we will be unable to pay our mortgage and therefore lose the house.This is a miracle pregnancy and I have been unable to see my family since the beginning of February. They live 150 miles away and not being able to be with them during my pregnancy has been really challenging and upsetting. The only positive to the lockdown is the positive impact it is having on the environment around the globe. Seeing wildlife flourish is great.I\u0027m a fundraising manager for the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in Putney. When the lockdown began I was required to work from home, but the hospital asked for staff volunteers willing to help out during the crisis. I signed up and for the past two months I have been running the hospital\u0027s uniform control, distributing clean uniforms and scrubs to front-line staff. I do that for three hours in the morning and then return home to do my regular job.Not seeing my regular group of friends has been very challenging and some friendships have definitely fallen by the wayside during lockdown. But volunteering means I\u0027ve met so many more people than I would have done had I just stuck to doing my regular job from home. Having that opportunity has helped me to maintain my mental wellbeing too.The most positive outcome of my experience has been the overwhelming support the hospital has received from the wider community. They have come together to help us through the difficulties we faced sourcing PPE. In particular, local community groups and churches have been able to provide us with over 200 sets of handmade scrubs for front-line staff. One lady donated a set featuring Marvel superheroes, which she made from a duvet cover given to her by her neighbour\u0027s young son. Without all the hard work of these community volunteers we would have really struggled to provide appropriate clothing for staff working on wards.Jane Dean, a volunteer from Highcliffe:I now appreciate the simple pleasures in life, like a sunny day and walking to the sea. I’ve really connected with my neighbours and the community spirit has given me hope for a more promising, kinder future.On VE Day 75 my neighbours got together to celebrate, remember and comfort one another. We marked the end of one crisis while managing this current one! We decorated our road in red, white and blue, drank wine and danced at a distance. If this is our new normal and a glimpse of our future, then it’s restored my faith in mankind as there is so much good and compassion in people.I live in Highcliffe and work voluntary for a group called Highcliffe Action Team. Our Facebook page #LoveHighcliffe features images and posts of what’s been taking place in and around our village. This includes our local bakery working 20 hours to make enough bread to serve and supply the community and our butcher getting up at 4 a.m. to produce thousands of his award-winning pork sausages. A tree in our local health centre has been decorated with hearts, rainbow cutouts and messages of thanks. Our beach is littered with pebbles and stones painted by children with well wishes and love. In the words of the late, great Louis Armstrong \u0027It’s A Wonderful World\u0027.Hannah, the mother to a Generation C baby:My son was born on March 26 and he is classed as a Generation C baby. While I\u0027ve had my partner and daughter at home with me, my family haven\u0027t met my son properly yet. It has been a tough few weeks without the support of my mum and sister.A positive of lockdown has been the time that we have had with our son to bond and spending time at home with my daughter that I\u0027ll probably never have again.Eugene Roberts, a 63-year-old Briton in Catalonia:We have spent 67 days, so far, in lockdown in Catalonia as we have a home here. Our dog was injured in February so we could not repatriate ourselves to the UK as he was not fit to travel at lockdown. Our son, wife and grandson (15 months old) live in Barcelona but we have been separated throughout this period.Our village of 1,200 residents has been hard-hit by Covid-19. We have been desperate to stay well, to avoid hospital, where my 65- year-old husband and myself (63 years old) would have been separated and unable to easily communicate with staff.The town hall staff have been amazing, communicating every day to tell us about the latest government and health information, balcony concerts, local suppliers making home deliveries and coordinating sewers, including myself, to make masks and gowns for the hospital and care facilities in and around our nearest large town.Our Catalan neighbours have also been brilliant, buying us fresh milk for our \u0027English tea\u0027 and checking if we needed anything. Being in lockdown, in solidarity, when they thought we would probably \u0027run for home\u0027 has helped us find acceptance here. We now feel safe and part of this wonderful community. We have discovered Zoom, so it has been wonderful to feel almost like your family and friends are in the room with you. We have watched more ballet and theatre performances, via YouTube, and I enjoyed sewing masks, albeit alone, but feeling I was contributing in the only way I could without being able to fluently speak Catalan.My husband retired at the start of lockdown and this lengthy period of stillness has helped him handle the transition from a hectic business life to a slower pace, I think. The biggest challenges have been cooking from a freezer and larder which only gets restocked every  two-three weeks, losing internet for three days but most the challenging aspect has not being able to see and cuddle our grandson.A lot has changed for me. I now work as a home-based educational support worker. My role used to involve a lot of face-to-face interaction and being around a lot of people, all of the time. I used to drive to work. Now, I help students attend virtual lessons. I contact new students with support needs and try to offer support and reassurance, without being able to give a clear picture of what the future will look like.I used to have a fairly active social life – meeting friends at their houses or the pub, seeing family and friends in different parts of the country, going to dancing lessons and a weekly fitness class. All of these have been cancelled. My workplace will be quite different when we return, and it may still involve some working from home. I feel more grateful. People seem to be noticing human qualities more, and currently there appears to be a move away from materialism and consumerism. This is very positive. At my work and where I live, people seem to take more time to talk to one another and to find out how they are. My colleagues and workplace are very supportive, well-being is a high and lived priority, which is very important. I now speak to my neighbours more and friends in other countries- due to the connection of the pandemic. Life has a slower pace. I feel a bit more at peace.Challenges come in wanting to talk to friends online, but friends having different needs. A challenge also comes from waking up each day and remembering that life is different as well as from others not following the lockdown rules and the loss of life. I\u0027m very curious, so I try to see this as a new situation, a change in lifestyle and the potential for a better society. The impact on the environment is hugely positive, and having time to reflect is a treasured gift.I have started golf and tennis lessons. I\u0027ve reconnected with friends and lost two stone through running. I\u0027ve learnt to bake bread and I\u0027ve started yoga and pilates. I feel strong and amazing.I\u0027ve spent positive quality time with my sons and I\u0027ve realised how important family is. But it is challenging being confined as I love movement and travel and seeing friends. It\u0027s the hardest job on earth being a single parent with zero support.My 86-year-old mum lives 320 miles away and is partially deaf so phone calls have become frustrating for both of us. We used to text and message regularly but knowing that she wouldn’t be seeing anyone as she normally would, we started to video call her each day via Facebook messenger. We play a game for an hour each day and she likes to see our dogs and play around with the filter effects on the the end of the call. I speak to my mum every day rather than every few weeks and I order her groceries online. I now feel more helpful to her than I’ve ever been.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"private schools plea ministers allow year groups return classroom","story":"Private school chiefs are pleading with ministers to allow more of their pupils to return next month, saying that their “hands are tied” without permission from the Government.Fee-paying institutions have been lobbying the Department of Education (DfE) to give them some flexibility about which year groups they are allowed to welcome back from June 1. But they say that their pleas have fallen on deaf ears, leaving them unable to secure the insurance cover they need to reopen.The Prime Minister said that schools should prepare to open for pupils in Reception, Year One and Year Six to return to school from June 1, with the “ambition” that all primary school children could be back in the classroom by the end of the month.Neil Roskilly, chief executive of the Independent School Association, said that two things are stopping private schools from going their own way.“The first is that ministers are saying they expect private schools to follow the pattern of state schools, he said. And the second is insurance companies which are refusing to cover schools’ legal liability if they go against the Government’s recommendation.”Headteachers’ “hands are tied” without liability cover from their insurers, he explained. “The insurance companies say ‘we won’t cover you, open at your own risk’. It’s a real dampener. Some schools are looking at whether parents can sign a disclaimer – but you can’t sign away negligence.If I was a parent and I was being asked to sign a disclaimer to indemnify the school 100 per cent against a claim, I would think twice. It is not an ideal solution.Mr Roskilly said that in some parts of the country, local council chiefs who oppose a June 1 return have written to private as well as state schools to warn them against opening.“The message that comes back at the moment from ministers is that they don’t want to consider variation,” he said. “I think there is a lot of sympathy, they do understand this issue.But what they don’t want to be doing is saying that independent schools can do one thing, and state schools can do another. Academies, I am sure, would love to have flexibility as well.“I am hoping that something will change with that between now and June. The bottom line is that it would be safe for schools to apply a level of variation.”Christopher King, chief executive of the Independent Prep School Association, also said that the Government’s lack of flexibility is proving difficult for his 670 members.Prep schools already tend to have smaller class sizes, he explained, adding that many are in rural areas with “significant amounts” of outdoor that can be used for social distancing. “Our schools would welcome the prospect of bringing more groups back,” he said. “For a good number of our members, the key transition is at Year Eight rather than Year Six so we would prefer to have them back in.  But we were told that the Government has decided that, for the simplicity of messaging, to keep to Year Six.”    Mr King said it is a source of “considerably frustration” for private school heads that they are not able to act independently.  A governor at one of the country’s leading private schools told The : “It feels to me that officials are petrified of independent schools successfully reopening ahead of the state sector because it shows the weakness of the Government not being able to stand up to the unions.”He added that private schools should be allowed to take a common sense approach to reopening, adding: More and more people realise life needs to continue. We just want to crack on with it.  A DfE spokesperson said: “Plans for a cautious, phased return of some year groups from 1 June, at the earliest, are based on the best scientific and medical advice. The welfare of children and staff has been at the heart of all decision making.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khan showboating mediocrity london deserves better","story":"Amid the gloom, some glad tidings. Coronavirus is disappearing from the capital. Once the worst-hit region in the UK, London is surging ahead in its recovery. Seventeen per cent of Londoners are now believed to be immune. This is inspirational, not just for regions lagging behind but in providing a compelling case for easing the city’s lockdown. The Government’s ill-timed and indiscriminate quarantine measures have made it utterly crucial to kickstart domestic growth. Yet the UK’s economic powerhouse remains under lockdown.Good thing that we London-dwellers have been blessed with a globally-minded Mayor, then? Sadly, Sadiq “London is open” Khan is missing in action. Instead of fighting to get the city moving, he has only hampered its recovery by hiking congestion charges. His decision to slash underground journeys meant cramming commuters into packed tubes. Under his watch, Transport for London has become a hotbed of waste, protectionism and mismanagement.Though progress remains stubbornly slow, developments suggest the Government is finally rethinking both its one-size-fits-all approach to lockdown, and its indulgent attitude towards Khan’s leadership. A new taskforce, jointly chaired by Khan and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick, will look to “restart” London’s economy. The latter appointment bodes well. Jenrick has had a good “coronavirus war” getting rough sleepers off the streets, restarting construction projects and spearheading deregulation measures. He epitomises the anti-Sadiq tendency making sensible decisions without fanfare.With Mayoral elections looming, however, the Conservatives must also contend with the forces of revisionism. Already, Khan is attributing TfL’s £1.6 billion government bailout to the shock of Covid-19, and it is vital that the Tories do not allow this narrative to gain traction. Though no one could expect TfL to weather the shock of a 90 per cent drop in incomes under lockdown, City Hall’s finances were in a parlous state long before the pandemic.While TfL operated at a loss, Khan indulged in costly gesture politics banning “junk” food and and political adverts (he made an exception for the People’s Vote campaign), leaving a £13 million financial hole. He doubled his own PR budget and ramped up City Hall staffing spending. To court favour with the electorate and vested interest groups, he scattered giveaways like confetti, leaving many travelling for free when they could easily afford it. Though his grandstanding played to the vanities of “liberal” Londoners, it was built on arrogant foundations the expectation of infinite subsidy and an assumption that the city belonged to Labour forever.This pandemic – and the patchy response across the four regions – has exposed the limits of Britain’s devolved settlement. Though this taskforce looks unlikely to give City Hall the radical shake-up it deserves, it is heartening to see Westminster finally defend its corner.

For those who had queued up on Friday, on the first day of its reopening since Italy’s strict lockdown began, it was enough simply to be able to enter the doors of the great cathedral and enjoy its ornate interiors once again.“Finalmente!” shouted one woman in delight as the doors were swung open by masked security staff. “At last!”The special devices, which are anonymous and do not track any data and are issued free on entry to each visitor, flash, vibrate and beep when people come within two metres of each other (see picture below). Timothy Verdon, director of the Duomo Museum, said the cathedral is the first in the world to employ such a device in a museum setting, adding that visitor numbers will be reduced in line with Italy\u0027s continuing social distancing measures, with online booking and masks now obligatory.At the entrance, guards used thermal scanners to take the temperature of visitors, before each one was given one of the devices. These will later be disinfected before being used again.While this may appear an antiseptic way of enjoying one of the world’s greatest churches it will come as a welcome relief to hundreds of Italians and foreign visitors, deprived until now of a glimpse of the ine since churches and cultural institutions shut in March.It\u0027s beautiful and touching to see the Duomo open again, especially since it\u0027s not often that you see it so empty, said Marco, a local resident. It\u0027s even better that way.Gabriele, another Florentine, pointed out that visits to the cathedral and its associated sights - which include the famous octagonal Baptistery and Giotto\u0027s free-standing 85 metre tall Campanile - were free until the end of the month.It\u0027s been so many years since I\u0027ve gone inside the Duomo. It\u0027s a perfect occasion to take advantage of with fewer tourists and people, he said. It\u0027s a great feeling.Within 24 hours of the announcement that the Duomo was to re-open, more than 10,000 people reserved tickets.The Duomo’s administrators said they were surprised by the overwhelming enthusiasm of those who wanted to visit the building, begun in 1296 in the Gothic style and not completed until 1436, with the building of Filippo Brunelleschi’s Dome.  Lorenzo Luchetti, director general of Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore, which administers the cathedral, said the reopening marked a symbolic moment for Italy following the ordeal of the pandemic, which has killed more than 32,600 people on the peninsula.We decided to reopen free of charge for everyone to give a message of hope, of revival, of a return to normal life, he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wind farms paid record 93m switch turbines","story":"Wind farms in Britain were paid a record £.9.3m to switch off their turbines on Friday, The Sunday  can disclose.More than 80 plants across England and Scotland were handed the so-called \u0027constraint payments\u0027, when supply outstrips demand, by the National Grid, as thousands of buildings lying empty following the coronavirus lockdown contributed to a nosee in demand for energy.In what has been declared a national embarrassment and a power management disgrace by campaigners, consumers will ultimately foot the bill of £6.9m to 66 Scottish plants and £1.9m to 14 offshore plants in England.This is almost double the previous single day record payout to wind farm operators, which was £4.8m on Oct 8, 2018, when turbines were switched off because it became too windy.It is believed the low demand for electricity on May 22 was due to windy and sunny weather this week, with solar panels likely to have produced a lot of energy, combined with the lack of demand for power given the Covid-19 lockdown which has seen many businesses close.So worrying was the development that the National Grid issued an alert to stop it happening for a second day running.Dr John Constable, director of Renewable Energy Foundation, a UK charity that monitors energy use, said: “Overdeployment of renewables in the UK, particularly uncontrollable wind and solar, has resulted in a very fragile electricity system, which is inflexible and unable to deal with accidents and unexpected circumstances at a reasonable cost to consumers.Grid balancing expenditure so far this year is already horrific and by the end of the summer it will be terrifying.This is a national embarrassment, and a disgrace to the management of the electricity sector who have complacently allowed this crisis to develop over the last decade.”The charity previously revealed that the operators of 86 wind farms in Britain were handed a record of more than £136m in constraint payments last year.Investing in new grid infrastructure is vital so that renewable generators can continue to provide consumers with the massive quantities of cheap electricity we need to achieve net zero emissions.“Constraint payments are the cheapest way for National Grid to run the electricity network within its current limits.All types of generation, including fossil fuels, receive them, but unlike older technologies, wind farms can turn off or on within a matter of seconds, and so wind is often called on by National Grid to vary its output.

Chief executive Kathryn Marinello resigned last week following reports of possible bankruptcy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company lost all revenue from mid-March when the global travel industry came to a shuddering halt. Much of the firm’s income is sourced from car rentals at airports but it started missing debt payments in April.Ms Marinello said at the company’s first-quarter earnings conference on 12 May: “No business is built for zero revenue. There’s only so long that companies’ reserves will carry them.”Why businesses should think about going flight-freeBusinesses are a bit more optimistic, but we\u0027re heading for recessionHow the Government is helping UK businesses in the Covid-19 crisisNew insolvency law to stop businesses going bust during pandemicIn the company’s first-quarter report earlier this month with securities regulators, Hertz warned it may not be able to repay or refinance debt and may not have enough cash to continue operations.The report said: “Management has concluded there is substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of this quarterly report.”Hertz said in a statement on Friday: “The impact of Covid-19 on travel demand was sudden and dramatic, causing an abrupt decline in the company’s revenue and future bookings.“Hertz took immediate actions to prioritise the health and safety of employees and customers, eliminate all non-essential spending and preserve liquidity.“However, uncertainty remains as to when revenue will return and when the used-car market will fully re-open for sales, which necessitated today’s action. The financial reorganisation will provide Hertz a path toward a more robust financial structure that best positions the company for the future as it navigates what could be a prolonged travel and overall global economic recovery.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But where they can’t, a range of further support will be available. People who are struggling and have not had a payment holiday will continue to be able to apply until 31 October.”Generally, mortgage interest still builds up during a payment holiday, unless the lender says otherwise. And the outstanding debt will still be owed by the borrower.Labour calls for suspension of rent payments for coronavirus affectedThis may mean a borrower might find they need to extend the length of their mortgage term when they come to the end of a payment holiday, in order to make sure their monthly payments are around the same level they were before.The FCA would still expect customers who can afford to return to full repayments to do so as this is in their best interests.At the end of a payment holiday, firms should contact their customers to find out if they can resume payments and if so, agree a plan on how the missed payments will be repaid.Firms are expected to engage with their customers and find out what they can repay and, for those who remain in temporary financial difficulty, offer further support.The FCA said payment holidays and partial payment holidays offered under this guidance should not have a negative impact on credit files.But it said people should remember that credit files are not the only source of information which lenders can use to assess creditworthiness.This guidance would also not prevent firms from providing more favourable forms of assistance to the customer, such as reducing or waiving interest.Economic secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: “Everyone’s circumstances will be different, so when homeowners can pay some or all of their mortgage, they should work with their lender on a plan but if they are still struggling, I want them to know that help is there.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The challenge now is to understand the processes in Earth\u0027s core driving theses changes.One possibility, according to the ESA, is that the weakening field is a sign that the Earth\u0027s magnetic field is about to reverse, whereby the North Pole and South Pole switch places.The last time a geomagnetic reversal took place was 780,000 years ago, with some scientists claiming that the next one is long overdue. Typically, such events take place every 250,000 years.Created with Sketch.\u0027Super bloom\u0027 of poppies visible from space: in pictures Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Satellite imagery shows the super bloom on Walker Canyon near Lake Elsinore in CaliforniaA woman sits in a super bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaMother and child among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaSatellite imagery shows the super bloom on Walker Canyon near Lake Elsinore in CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPeople sit in a super bloom of poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man stands among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA group of men take photos near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man walks among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA couple take a selfie among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA woman poses for a photo among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaSatellite imagery shows the super bloom on Walker Canyon near Lake Elsinore in CaliforniaA woman sits in a super bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaMother and child among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaSatellite imagery shows the super bloom on Walker Canyon near Lake Elsinore in CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPeople sit in a super bloom of poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man stands among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA group of men take photos near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man walks among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA couple take a selfie among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA woman poses for a photo among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaThe repercussions of such an event could be significant, as the Earth\u0027s magnetic field plays an important role in protecting the planet from solar winds and harmful cosmic radiation. Telecommunication and satellite systems also rely on it to operate, suggesting that computers and mobile phones could experience difficulties.The South Atlantic Anomaly is already causing issues with satellites orbiting Earth, the ESA warned, while spacecrafts flying in the area could also experience technical malfunctions.A 2018 study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that despite the weakening field, Earth\u0027s magnetic field is probably not reversing.The study also explained that the process is not an instantaneous one and could take tens of thousands of years to take place.ESA said it would continue to monitor the weakening magnetic field with its constellation of Swarm satellites.The mystery of the origin of the South Atlantic Anomaly has yet to be solved, the space agency stated.

MsTucker, who works at a Sephora beauty store in San Jose, California, had not heard of Musk until she started receiving his messages.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMobile network AT\u0026ampT assigned Tucker the number when Musk stopped using it, yet some websites listed it as Musk’s current number, resulting in numerous calls and messages.“I asked my mom, ‘Hey, I keep getting these text messages’ – and I was also now starting to get phone calls – ‘for this guy Elon Musk. I don’t know who this is’,” Tucker said. “And my mom’s jaw just dropped.”Elon Musk fears he will die before SpaceX makes it to MarsTucker has apparently received calls from a woman volunteering to go to space, an IRS representative calling about tax issues, a South African businessman who wanted to purchase 1,000 vehicles, and another with a blueprint for a bionic limb “which is, number one, really cool, but I have no idea how it’s built,” Tucker said.Tulsa unveils giant statue of Elon Musk to try and lure TeslaMatrix director slams Elon Musk and Ivanka Trump for ‘red pill’ tweetsElon Musk tweets ‘Facebook sucks’ at company’s Head of AIShe also received texts from Former Walt Disney executive John Lasseter about his recently purchased Tesla.However, Tucker often has to prove that she is not Musk to those calling her. “They say, ‘Oh, how do I know you’re not Elon?’,” she said. “And they suddenly want proof that I’m not him even though they’re obviously talking to a woman on the phone.” Reached for comment by NPR, Musk said “Wow. That number is so old! I’m surprised it’s still out there somewhere.” Musk did not respond to whether he gave that number out to people he was trying to avoid.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re always experimenting with future concepts using different hardware configurations as part of our proof-of-experience process” Bozworth also tweeted.Virtual reality is content computer-generated in three dimensions in a digital environment, while augmented reality – or mixed reality – is digital content layered over a real-world environment, such as Pokemon Go.The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that half of its workforce will likely work remotely over the next five to ten years.“We need to do this in a way that’s thoughtful and responsible, so we’re going to do this in a measured way, he said. But I think that it’s possible that over the next five to 10 years — maybe closer to 10 than five, but somewhere in that range — I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently.“VR and AR is all about giving people remote presence. So if you’re long on VR and AR and on video chat, you have to believe in some capacity that you’re helping people be able to do whatever they want from wherever they are. So I think that that suggests a worldview that would lead to allowing people to work more remotely over time.” What has Facebook done to fix election interference since 2016?Facebook wants to build a ‘hateful meme’ AI to clean up its platformFacebook’s Oculus is developing a new Quest VR headsetThe company also published a blog post  saying that it would create a “super-powered augmented workspace with multiple customizable screens in VR, unbounded from the limits of ​physical monitors.”It would use Passthrough – a technology used on Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality hardware that lets you “temporarily step outside VR to see a real-time view of the world around you” - to let people switch between their real and virtual worlds with the hope that by “combining the flexibility of new inputs like hand tracking with the familiarity of everyday input devices like a keyboard and mouse, we could give people the best of both worlds.”The company is also developing virtual avatars called Codec Avatars which would “let people in the future create lifelike virtual avatars of themselves quickly and easily, helping social connections in virtual reality become as natural and common as those in the real world.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The extraordinary tale is told in Dutch historian Rutger Bregman\u0027s new book Humankind: A Hopeful History, in which he argues that humanity is fundamentally compassionate.As evidence, he presents the true story of six boys from Tonga in Polynesia who, in 1965, skipped school to go on a fishing trip only to get caught in a storm.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe teenagers, aged between 13 and 16, were shipwrecked Lord of the Flies-style on a tiny island for over a year, during which time they committed to fishing, foraging and caring for one another until they were rescued by a passing boat. Cultural appropriation? Who is allowed to tell the story of the TongaBregman has now confirmed that New Regency had won the battle, and said the offer was accepted in a collective decision by himself, the four living survivors – Sione, Mano, Tevita and Luke – and the Australian sailor, Peter Warner, who rescued them.“We had received lots of offers, and pitches. It was really important to all of us that they understood this was a Tongan story, there were very deep cultural reasons why these boys were able to survive – their spirituality, their upbringing. Yesterday at 6am we had a Zoom call, all of us, in four different time zones. When we made the decision it was a very emotional moment for all of us.”Bregman says the proceeds will be shared equally, with each receiving one-sixth. Bregman says he will donate his share to a Tongan charity. Sione, Mano, Tevita and Luke will reportedly act as consultants on the film.

But where they can’t, a range of further support will be available. People who are struggling and have not had a payment holiday will continue to be able to apply until 31 October.”Generally, mortgage interest still builds up during a payment holiday, unless the lender says otherwise. And the outstanding debt will still be owed by the borrower.Labour calls for suspension of rent payments for coronavirus affectedThis may mean a borrower might find they need to extend the length of their mortgage term when they come to the end of a payment holiday, in order to make sure their monthly payments are around the same level they were before.The FCA would still expect customers who can afford to return to full repayments to do so as this is in their best interests.At the end of a payment holiday, firms should contact their customers to find out if they can resume payments and if so, agree a plan on how the missed payments will be repaid.Firms are expected to engage with their customers and find out what they can repay and, for those who remain in temporary financial difficulty, offer further support.The FCA said payment holidays and partial payment holidays offered under this guidance should not have a negative impact on credit files.But it said people should remember that credit files are not the only source of information which lenders can use to assess creditworthiness.This guidance would also not prevent firms from providing more favourable forms of assistance to the customer, such as reducing or waiving interest.Economic secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: “Everyone’s circumstances will be different, so when homeowners can pay some or all of their mortgage, they should work with their lender on a plan but if they are still struggling, I want them to know that help is there.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPrevious analysis of data from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency revealed the unprecedented scale of the emissions decline.China saw the largest drop in emissions in April, followed by the United States, Europe and India.In the countries with the strictest lockdown restrictions, emissions from aviation plunged 75 per cent in early April, while emissions from land transport fell by 50 per cent and from power generation by 15 per cent.Emissions from industry declined by around 35 per cent, with a lack of data causing some uncertainty. Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a question of doing the right thing. It’s not about what you guys think.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo 10 have said the visit he made to Durham was  “essential”. In the first official comment since it emerged that the prime minister’s chief adviser had apparently flouted lockdown rules, Downing Street said his actions were “in line” with the guidelines. But the SNP have written to Sir Mark Sedwill, the head of the Civil Service, calling for him to investigate both Mr Cummings’ trip and what was known about it in Downing Street.

Defending Mr Cummings, a No 10 spokesman said:  “Owing to his wife being infected with suspected Coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for. His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed. His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside. At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.”Members of the cabinet also defended Mr Cummings.Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, tweeted: “Taking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t.” Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, wrote in a similar vein: “It’s reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this. And it has been provided: two parents with Coronavirus, were anxiously taking care of their young child. Those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror.”Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, added: “Caring for your wife and child is not a crime.” Opposition politicians have accused No 10 of a ‘cover up’ after reports some in Downing Street knew Mr Cummings had made the 260-mile journey during lockdown.Labour have called on Boris  Johnson to say whether or not he sanctioned the trip.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said that Mr Johnson had questions to answer  and should fire his chief adviser immediately. Police have confirmed they visited a property in County Durham after Mr Cummings made the  trip from his London home.

He called on Mr Johnson to state publicly if he believed Mr Cummings had adhered to the rules. “It’s clearly a matter of public interest - lockdown has been heartbreaking for so many families,  this looks like one rule for those at the centre of government and one rule for everyone else,” he said.  The details of Mr Cumming’s trip were revealed by the Daily Mirror and the . A neighbour told the papers Mr Cummings was seen in the garden, while Abba\u0027s Dancing Queen was playing loudly. Durham police confirmed officers had spoken to the owners of an address after reports a person had travelled there from London.A spokesman said: On Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware of reports that an inidual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city.Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the inidual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house.In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the arrangements around self-isolation guidelines and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.Senior members of Mr Johnson’s own party expressed concern Mr Cumming’s journey could endanger the government’s plans to lift the lockdown. Former Tory cabinet minister  David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy prime minister, told Newsnight: There\u0027s clearly serious questions that No 10 are going to have to address, not least because the readiness of members of the public to follow government guidance more generally is going to be affected by this sort of story.Professor Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the lockdown, quit as a government adviser for flouting the rules when he was visited at this home by his girlfriend. At the time Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he was speechless and said he backed any police action against Mr Ferguson.Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Cummings to quit over the allegations, while a spokesman for Labour said: The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings.He told the BBC Mr Johnson had serious questions to answer. “Did he sanction this? Did he say “this is ok”?”Allies of Mr Cummings said he was  not “remotely bothered” by the story, calling it “fake news”. There is zero chance of him resigning.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Lethargic, hopeless and riven with internal dispute.There is fury in Spain that the EUwon’t bung them loads of money for being badly hit by the virus.It’s the same in Italy, where  per cent of the population now want to LEAVE the EU. The country that was usually one of the EU’s biggest cheerleaders.A disillusion with the EU is spreading across the continent.People are beginning to see that it’s a good thing to have control of your borders. And that the best way of controlling those borders is through a nation state.The Greeks have been trying to contain a mass influx of refugees from Turkey — and getting no help from the EU in the process. Some senior EU politicians fear that the virus could kill off the EU altogether. Right now it’s on a ventilator and looking very sorry for itself.We can only hope — for the good of our European friends — that someone switches that ventilator off.Once we all emerge from lockdown there will be a financial price to pay. Our economy — the world’s economy — has taken a hell of a battering.But the good news is that we will be in with a much better chance of a full recovery than the EU bloc.From  you will no longer have to pay tarfs on a vast range of goods imported from beyond Europe.I suspect it will lead to a consumer bonanza — which is just what we want. Washing machines, freezers, women’s sanitary products, bicycle inner tubes, Christmas trees — the list of stuff which will be cheaper is almost endless.It’s true thatthe EU refuses to soften its stance about a trade deal with us, then we’ll pay more for cars made on the continent.But even that might have its upside. It will encourage people to buy British. Last year Brits bought only , cars that had been manufactured in the UK. The majority of cars were bought from German plants. Your loss, Germany.The EU negotiators are still being intransigent. They still think they can bully this country.Michael Gove has told them to get real. Sort out an acceptable trade deal for the good of the entire European economy.But eventhey don’t — evenreality fails to establish itself inside their closed minds— it will be the EU that loses out.It wouldn’t surprise me hugelyCovid- outlasted the European Union, frankly. We should all breathe a sigh of relief that we got the hell out of that helpless institution.Just in time.I WONDERCovid- will see an end to hard cash  My local shopkeepers tell me that almost no transactions in the past two months have been paid in cash. It’s all done by card.I’ve had the same  quid in my pocket that was there on March .I bet we don’t go back to paying in cash once this is over. Queuing for ages behind some addled berk at the ATM who is incapable of pressing the right buttons. Cash is going the way of the dinosaurs.And it’s not too far of a stretch to suggest that offices might be on their way out, either. Hugely expensive things to run, offices. And the original reason we had them was to store paper – files and so on. Don’t really need that any more, do we  People have discovered that working from home has many benefits. Not least the pleasure of avoiding pointless meetings with idiots.And for those who feel the need to get away from their families on a daily basis there’s “co-working environments”, or “the park with a load of booze”, as I like to call it.MOST lady slebs are busy during lockdown taking pictures of themselves wearing almost no clothes.Either to advertise products nobody really wants or to advertise themselves. For which many thanks, girls.Scarcely a day goes by without one of them taking a perfectly natural selfie of herself with hardly any clothes on, pouting at the camera like a trout with a botched facelt.Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has gone a stage further and posted pics of herself taken  years ago. Just in case we’d forgotten.I might get in on the act. Next week I’ll take a selfie wearing a leather thong and nipple clamps, advertising my new skincare product made from vole’s urine.Watch this space.I’m not so sure. Boredom is a greatly underrated virtue. It makes you get off your backside and do something. And our kids have been bored senseless for two months now.You never know, this break might do the kids some good. Fire their imaginations or something.And better still – it means they’re not having left-wing drivel drilled into their heads by the teachers…THE English Football League is in a right old mess.None of its three isions can agree what to do about finishing the season.The clubs in the lowest tier, ision two, have voted to end the season immediately. Those in the Championship want to finish the season, while League One clubs haven’t a clue.There’s talk of Coventry and Rotherham being promoted and a play-off between the next EIGHT clubs.I know a lot of money is at stake. I know the league has signed big deals with the broad- casters. But the sensible thing surely would have been to call the season null and void, across all three isions.Those of us who, like me, support clubs who had a chance of promotion will get over our disappointment.There are more important things than football.So let’s look at Sweden. It became the country with the highest death rate per capita from Covid- in Europe during thesevendays to May .The lockdown has unquestionably saved lives.LAST Friday night I was called  times in the space of an hour by the SAME NUMBER.What’s more, my phone told me the call was coming from Tajikistan. But every time I tried to answer, the caller hung up. That’s totally unfair.I have never in my le spoken to a person from Tajikistan. And I would very much like to do so. It might be interesting.I’m sure it was a criminal of some kind, but that’s not the point.I wanted to knowmy caller was a member of the mysterious Yaghnobi people, who live in the mountains in the north of the country, with their many goats. That would have been exciting.I might start ringing up numbers in Tajikistan indiscriminately. And then move on to Kyrgyzstan.That’s what lockdown does to you.For this they have been attacked by “human rights activists”.Perhaps.But not by the people of Hungary, who fully agree with this measure.Much as I suspect people would over here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It doesn’t fit the media narrative of Sturgeon the superstar. Likewise, Scotland has had far more deaths in care homes than England when adjusted for population.And Sturgeon has an even bigger issue when it comes to Scotland’s anaemic testing operation.The country has a much higher rate of Covid- per head than England and has been carrying out just a quarter of the tests England has per capita. Truly dire.So who has emerged as Sturgeon’s knight in shining armour Her bête noire, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who this week announced anyone in the UK with symptoms can receive a test from the NHS.As for those lockdown-lting measures from Boris that pious Sturgeon used for maximum media impact, including a farcical suggestion from her party to introduce a police border between Scotland and England — knock me down with a feather! — she’s only gone and followed suit a week later.Sturgeon’s behaviour in the midst of a genuine international health emergency has been unseemly.But with enemies in her own party circling over her complete failure to push forward the independence cause, expect to see more desperate stunts in the weeks to come. The media should be wise to her tricks.But maybe BBC bosses are finally listening. Five months after I wrote in this column that axing BBC had been disastrous and BBC should have been cut instead, they are now doing a U-turn to make that very change.Right. Time for a  wishlist then. Can EastEnders and Have I Got News For You be chopped next  Oh, and The Mash Report and Newsnight too.But I’ll take two series of The Apprentice a year instead.APPARENTLY it’s only OK to be gayyou’re a raving Corbynista Remoaner.That’s particularly offensive to yours truly – but the only message to take from the shocking cancellation of the Virtual Pride festival this week.Big names from Dannii Minogue to Andrew Lloyd Webber were due to appear during the ten-hour online extravaganza, organised to replace the ious gay gatherings that are usually held over summer.But then, all of a sudden, the event was axed.The organiser, it was claimed, had committed a cardinal sin.Racism  Nope.Sexism  Definitely not.Breaking draconian lockdown restrictions  Hell no.It turns out that Charlie Shakespeare was actually a Brexit supporter who had – shock horror! – liked tweets by Nigel Farage and The Spectator’s associate editor Toby Young.Corbyn adviser Linda Riley, the publisher of Diva magazine, tweeted: “Any LGBTQ event which supports the likes of these will not have my support. #proudtobeapoliticalbigot.”This sort of persecution of an LGBT ally by the London liberal media elite – simply because he harbours a dferent political view – is a disgrace.Just like any other group in society, the gay community is politically erse.And militant LGBT activists should realise we will only achieve true acceptance by embracing this ersity.As well as being an accurate accolade, it’s an apt choice for the lockdown era. “Couldn’t escapeI wanted to . . . ”WHAT does public le in the UK look like without appearances from the Queen Not a prospect I’ve ever wanted to consider, but one growing more and more likely as the -year-old continues to shelter at Windsor Castle with just a skeleton staff.What a tragedyan unexpected consequence of this ghastly pandemic from China is the greatest British monarch of all-time being forced to remain locked away from her adoring public.While far lesser royals might be able to stay front-of-mind with Zoom calls and ious other stunts filmed on mobile phones, that would be unbecoming of the Queen, who has always picked her moments to emerge in public with decorum and class.The idea of regular TV or other media addresses isn’t right either.There is a reason there have only been a handful over the course of her reign. They really mean something.But as a loyal subject, I concur that the health of Her Majesty – deep into the most vulnerable age group – matters more than anything .In a perfect world, I like to imagine she is enjoying the retirement with the Duke of Edinburgh she probably never thought she would have.“Put the kettle on please, Phil.

In London, there are few new cases, and other regions can be expected to follow the same trend.Yet still we proceed with glacial speed towards a tentative easing an agonising ten days away.Is it likely, in that context, that the Government would take a dangerous punt on teachers’ safety, as unions suggest  No.And Sage’s advice, published tomorrow, says they will be at no greater risk back in class than any key worker.It suits the Left to paint the Tories as rash, callous and indferent to evidence.The opposite seems to be true, to a fault.BORIS Johnson has done the right thing lting the NHS charge for migrant health and care workers.It was unjust that they had to find hundreds of pounds to use the very system in which they work.No one knows better than Boris the vital role they’re performing.And it is a mark of strong leadership, especially in a fast-moving crisis, to be able to admit you were wrong and change course.But the surcharge must continue to apply for workers in other sectors.It curtails health tourism and offsets the cost of treatment . . . and still should.WE understand Rishi Sunak’s fears that the self-employed bailout is ripe for fraud — and his reluctance to extend it.But fair’s fair.The Government cannot shut millions of businesses, then not fully support them.That is a disaster morally, economically and politically.Employees have been seen right.Cut off the cash to self-starters, though, and the lockdown will crumble in minutes.WE asked how Steve Coogan could defend claiming taxpayers’ money for his ­furloughed staff.Turns out he couldn’t.Instead he bleated that he was targeted because of his anti-Press campaign.Rubbish. Coogan is cashing in on a scheme meant to save jobs, not to keep his fortune intact.The public interest in that story could not be more obvious.As for his zeal to “reform” the Press, it is entirely self-serving:To prevent it exposing grasping multi-millionaires like him.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But hang on a minute.Are we absolutely certain it’s going to be completely safe by then  Not just for all the daytrippers and holidaymakers, but for the people who are lucky enough to live in the most scenic and glorious parts of our country.I know a lot of businesses are struggling — especially hotels, BBs, restaurants, and tourist attractions — and they desperately need an influx of visitors in order to survive.But that has to be weighed up against the safety and well-being of local people.It’s especially true in areas relatively free from Covid-.A surge of tourists could have the same sort of catastrophic effect that befell the Incas, Native Americans and tribes in the Caribbean who were decimated by disease when Europeans first arrived on their shores.The last thing we want to do is further spread this cruel virus and create a second wave that engulfs our NHS.It would mean all of our efforts staying at home and being so careful about handwashing and social-distancing would have been for nought.No one wants to see the emergency Nightingale and Louisa Jordan hospitals actually being used to anywhere near capacity.And our vulnerable care homes must not experience more deaths.I’d rather exercise caution and put off any holiday plans until we have this properly under control — hopefully just a few weeks longer.I’ve been very dismayed this week at the way everyone seems to have let their guard down.Social-distancing is nowhere near as stringent, and people are drting into pre-Covid behaviour.Of course we need to get back to some sort of “new normal” but I think this has to be done with baby steps.The hordes of sun-worshippers on crowded beaches on the south coast of England, large groups of friends enjoying picnics and teenagers gathering in big numbers to have a booze-up are a recipe for utter disaster.There’s nothing I would enjoy more than being able to go on my annual trip to Orkney, which was of course put on hold earlier this year.It’s one of the highlights of my year and I can feel the stress oozing out of my body when I set foot on this glorious part of the world.The welcome is warm, the food is enticing, the local gin and whisky are things of beauty and just breathing in the fresh air on those coastal walks is a joy.I’d go back this second, but onlythe people of Orkney want me there, and onlyit’s safe to do so.Again it comes down to having clear, no-nonsense, unfudged information.It’s not good enough just to tell us all to be “alert”.I need someone in charge who is trustworthy to tell me that visiting a UK tourist destination this summer will be safe for all concerned.I desperately want to support our tourist industry and I think most of us will be staying at home this year and exploring attractions closer to home.Our Good Morning Britain GP, Dr Hilary, who has been the nation’s voice of reason during this whole crisis, has said he would not be comfortable taking a flight any time soon and I have to agree.I know the aviation industry is in deep trouble, but I don’t see how you can stay socially distanced on a plane, and personally I’d rather err on the side of caution.I feel desperately sorry for families who have booked their summer hols abroad and are now waiting to seethey will go ahead without the prospect of having to quarantine on arrival.They also need clear direction from the Governmentthey have to apply for refunds on their hard-earned deposits or air tickets.None of us wants to be part of the problem, and we need to do everything we possibly can to stop that dreaded second wave.We just need more clarity before we throw caution to the wind.ONE of the joys of social media at the moment is “singing policeman” Tim Jones, who has been posting videos of himself belting out musical theatre songs in his squad car.Tim, from Gloucester, was overwhelmed by the reaction to his rendition of Rocky Horror Show classic Sweet Transvestite, which received more than four million hits and a fan message from US actress Susan Sarandon, who starred in the movie version.Tim started posting the songs to cheer himself up because he was missing his kids during lockdown and wasn’t in a good place mentally.I hope the praise that has poured in for this talented and handsome fella has helped him cope.He’s an excellent copper but I reckon, with all that charisma, a career in the West End beckons once all the theatres light up again.BEING a step-parent is not always plain sailing, but the delightful Christine Lampard has managed it with her usual kindness and grace.This week she helped celebrate step-daughter Isla’s th birthday and showed what a close and loving relation- ship the family enjoys.Husband Frank, the Cha football manager, has two daughters, Isla with Christine – and -year-old Luna, from his previous relationship, as well as -month-old toddler Patricia with Christine.Christine has forged a close bond with the girls.She’s never tried to be a second mother to them, but a sort of big sister and a good friend – and she’s got it spot on.Even though it’s not easy for any teenager to have such a special birthday in lockdown, Isla clearly had a very happy day with her family, and right now that’s what’s most important.I will be doing my ITV show from am every morning as usual and I want to say thanks for all your kind messages about the show and also all of your feedback on this column.I really appreciate you all getting in touch.See you Monday at am on ITV and here next Saturday as usual.WE have seen the best of people during this crisis.Our frontline workers have been heroic, as have staff in public transport and those emptying our bins.The amount of money raised for the NHS – from tiny tots to OAPs – has been humbling.Captain Tom Moore, who was made an honorary colonel to mark his th birthday, is quite rightly being knighted for his efforts.Not only did he raise £million, he also lted our spirits.Then we have -year-old Dabirul Choudhury, who walked  laps of his garden during Ramadan.This wonderful man has raised £, for those affected by coronavirus both here and in Bangladesh.There’s also -year-old Margaret Payne, who is more than halfway through her challenge of “climbing Scottish mountain Suilven” by going up and down the stairs at her home.She’s already raised well over £, for the NHS, Highland Hospice and RNLI.Sadly, it’s this admirable generation that has been thrown under the bus.Far too many elderly people were sent home from hospital and into care homes to “unblock beds” in preparation for Covid- patients.Crucially, they weren’t tested for the virus, which spread like wildfire in care homes from the Isle of Skye to Brighton, causing patients to die well before their time.Care home workers in particular have been astonishingly brave and resilient, and some have paid with their lives.Their sacrices must never be forgotten.Yet while we see the very best in humanity, this crisis has also brought out the very worst.I’m distraught and angry to learn that more than  NHS workers and police officers have been attacked during lockdown.This includes thugs spitting at and trying to bite frontline workers, and NHS grafters being assaulted by yobs trying to steal their ID cards to use for store discounts.It’s hard to imagine the sort of despicable low-le cretin who would resort to such crimes, especially against those trying to help us through the pandemic.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I therefore switched to red wine, which meant that by nine in the evening my face was in the bouillabaisse.So I alighted on rosé and I’ve never looked back.A lot of people think it can only be drunk at lunchtime on a hot summer’s day. This is ­nonsense.It also works well when it’s raining, foggy, windy, drizzling, cloudy or cold.I’ve drunk rosé on Bonfire Night and Christmas Day. I even took a case to the North Pole.This really is a wine for all occasions.It goes perfectly not just with avocado and salad but also with meat, fish, curry, pasta and cornflakes.Some call it lady ­petrol, saying it’s a girls’ drink. They reckon it’s just Sarah Jessica Parker in a bottle.But that’s not so. Brad Pitt loves it. And the best sort is Léoube. Which is made by the family that also makes JCB diggers. So there you are. Real men drink pink.And it’s easy to see why.You can spend hours a day in the gym trying to change the shape of your body.It hurts, it makes you sweaty and the results are a long time coming.Whereasyou have just three large glasses of rosé in the evening, which is not hard work, your body will change shape in no time at all.And don’t forget thatyou drink rosé, wine enthusiasts won’t bore you to death about the claret they had last night and how it had high notes of hot handbags in a Bovril factory.They will assume you aren’t interested in wine at all. Which you’re not, because you’ll happily put ice in it.Rosé may look like wine and smell like wine, and it may come in a wine bottle, but there’s no snobbishness to it.It’s just something you drink because you want to feel happy.Six weeks ago, Andy Wilman, who’s my oldest friend and the producer of The Grand Tour, was struck down by coronavirus.Happily, he recovered without having to go to hospital, but he was never back up to full speed before the virus came again.So the next time a family from Keswick comes to London to see a show, let’s tell them to bugger off back to where they came from.Bad news. The future of BBC is in doubt, which means I could be about to lose my favourite lockdown TV show – The Joy Of Painting, with Bob Ross.Filmed in old-fashioned square format, it’s hosted by a man who died  years ago. So we are not talking cutting-edge television here.What you get is a man with Art Garfunkel hair and a Bill Oddie beard who sits there in what look suspiciously like Brutus jeans, painting a picture. That’s it.He has the sort of voice hypnotists use when they are trying to get you to give up smoking, which means you are quickly lulled into a deep, drooling stupor.After five minutes, his picture is starting to take shape and I guarantee you’ll think what I always think – “I could do that”.Five minutes later you’ll be thinking, “I should do that”. And the next thing you know, you’re on Amazon, ordering an easel.This is a big mistake, as painting is much harder than it looks. A point that becomes glaringly obvious as the show goes on.After  minutes he’s always created a pretty good scene but every- thing he adds after that always ruins it a bit until, when the show ends after half an hour, the final result is so bad you have to bite the back of your hand to stop yourself guffawing.It’s the best and funniest thing on TV right now. By miles.We were told this week the actress Amber Heard had gone “horseback riding”.I don’t understand this uniquely American expression.Because what other part of a horse can you ride on Say “horse riding” and it’ll be clear she wasn’t trotting about on its head.In fact, just say “riding” and it’ll be OK. We won’t think she’s been gallivanting around on her rabbit.The best-selling car in Britain last month was the battery-powered Tesla .Yup, it beat the Ford Fiesta and all the other usual suspects, and you’ll probably see this as proof that at long last the electric car revolution is starting to happen.Hmmm. I reckon the reason is simpler. To buy a car in the middle of a lockdown you have to be mad.Am I suggesting that you have to be mad to buy a Tesla Well, let’s examine the evidence. I know only two people who have one. James May and Richard Hammond.We learned this week that when the intensely boring sport of cricket resumes, bowlers will no longer be able to use their saliva to make the ball do weird things as it heads towards the batsman.We’ve also heard that footballers will not be allowed to spit, and we assume that boxers will have to dance about, not spraying sweat all over the place as they maintain a two-metre distance.All of which makes me wonder, how is anyone ever going to make a porn film Stars of the industry say Covid- has forced them to shoot their own scenes and do their own editing.

It’s not about what you guys think.”Boris Johnson has faced heated calls to sack Mr Cummings today.But an official statement from Downing Street gave Nos full backing and said he didnt break government guidance because he and his we, journalist Mary Wakefield, stayed in a dferent building.A No spokesperson also challenged reports the aide and his family had been spoken to by police.A statement said: Owing to his we being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed.His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside.At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported.His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines.Mr Cummings reportedly travelled to Durham so his parents could help with child care while he and his we had Covid- symptoms.He contracted coronavirus at the end of March.

I recognised Dominic Cummings, he’s a very distinctive figure.”The revelation comes despite No telling Brits they must stay at home and not see family to slow the spread of Covid.The move allegedly went against advice, which became law on March , which stated: “You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.”Only in exceptional circumstances were people allowed to attend relatives addresses for example, to drop off food or medicine to their door.Durham Constabulary said they had spoken to Mr Cummings’ parents - which has been denied by No - about his visit.A spokesman for the force said: “On Tuesday, March , our officers were made aware of reports that an inidual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city.“Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the inidual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house.“In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel”.The news comes as the coronavirus death toll in the UK hit , today after  more deaths.Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey today called for Mr Cummings to explain himself - or resign.He said: If Dominic Cummings has broken the lockdown guidelines, he will have to resign. Its as simple as that.And in an interview with Sky News today, he said: It looks quite outrageous that the PMs closest adviser has done this.The Labour Party has demanded a very swt explanation from Downing Street over reports that Mr Cummings broke the Governments lockdown rules.A Labour spokesman said: If accurate, the Prime Ministers chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules.The Governments guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel.The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings.Number  needs to provide a very swt explanation for his actions.Acting Durham Police, Crime and Victims’ Commissioner, Steve White, called Mr Cummings decision most unwise.But senior Tory officials have come out in support of Mr Cummings today.Minister Michael Gove has taken to Twitter in suppoer od Mr Cummings, writing: Caring for your we and child is not a crime.Chancellor Rishi Sunak also wrote on social media: Taking care of your we and young child is justiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t.Journalist Mary Wakefield revealed that No chief Mr Cummings, , spent  days bedridden after collapsing and having spasms.In the article, Wakfield said her husband was nursed by their young son - despite new claims the family had travelled to Durham for child care.She said: My husband did rush home to look after me.He’s an extremely kind man, whatever people assume to the contrary.But  hours later, he said, ‘I feel weird’ and collapsed.I felt breathless, sometimes achy, but Dom couldn’t get out of bed.Day in, day out for ten days he lay doggo with a high fever and spasms that made the muscles lump and twitch in his legs. He could breathe, but only in a limited, shallow way.The little oxygen reader we’d bought on Amazon indicated that he should be in hospital, but his lips weren’t blue and he could talk in full sentences, she wrote.She also appears to have suggested the family remained at their London home for the duration of the illness, writing: After the uncertainty of the bug itself, we emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown.Dominic Raab posted: It’s reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this.And it has been provided: two parents with coronavirus, were anxiously taking care of their young child.Those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here."},{"url":null,"title":"kids scarred unions stopping school return","story":"THE lockdown is scarring children for le, scientists warned yesterday.Kids are undergoing a “shock” that will last into adulthood.And unless they get back into the classroom soon they will have LESS chance to socialise with pals and LESS hope of getting opportunities in future.Yet hardline unions are fighting plans for a phasedfor primary schools from June  — despite children being LESS likely to catch the coronavirus.On top of that, safeguards would include classes being halved in size to just  pupils.Schools would be carefully cleaned and children placed in protective “bubbles” preventing them mixing with kids or staff in other groups.Breaks and lunches would be staggered and classes held outside wherever possible.If all went well, every primary pupil couldby June  to squeeze in a full month before the summer holidays.A report published yesterday by the Government’s Sage scientic advisory group detailed the cost the shutdown was already having.It warned: “A cohort of children has experienced a shock to their education which will persist and affect their educational and work outcomes for the rest of their lives. Similarly, the current lockdown may lead to an increase in adverse childhood experiences — for example, domestic violence, poor parental mental health, child neglect or abuse.”These are all “associated with worse long-term health outcomes, and will likely exacerbate existing societal inequalities”. And they added the impact on “educational attainment, health outcomes” and social inequality is “critical”.But the documents also said the risk to children of reopening schools was “very low”.One study they considered found that children are  per cent less likely to catch the virus.The scientists stressed: “Evidence remains inconclusive on both the susceptibility and infectivity of children, but the balance of evidence suggests that both may be lower than in adults.”Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told yesterday’s Downing Street press conference: “The risks to children of this disease are much lower. We know that — they are at very low risk.“Not zero risk — and there have been some serious cases in children of course — but very few compared to adults and older age groups.”Ministers want schools to reopen for reception, Year s and Year  on June , with the rest of primary pupils and Year s and Year s ing gradually afterwards.Sage believes an “effective test, trace and isolate system” to battle Covid- should be in place before schools reopen. PM Boris Johnson has pledged to get one up and running by the time kidsin little more than a week.A source close to the deliberations said heading back to class should be no riskier for kids than venturing outside.They added: “The risk is very low. It’s not zero, but that remains true for every activity outside the house where you might come into contact with people.”They said teachers would be at no higher risk than millions of other key workers.Sage modelled a string of plans to reopen schools, from ordering all kids back to class, to limiting it to certain year groups.The Government’s plan to limit class sizes to  and only have a phasedof some year groups first — starting with among the youngest — was not modelled. But the documents suggest it is one of the most cautious approaches.Last night Prof Matthew Snape, of Oxford University, said: “Underlying all this needs to be the recognition that Covid- in children is, fortunately, rare. The information we have suggests this would remain the case for all scenarios of school reopening.”However teaching union the National Education Union, which had been furiously demanding the Sage advice be published, still vowed to fight the back-to-school plan.Joint general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: “It remains the case that the National Education Union does not yet think it safe for the wider opening of schools.“In addition to track and trace and the case numbers, we need to see regular testing and PPE for those who need it.” She even accused the Government of adopting a “cavalier attitude towards the nation’s children”.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, pictured far left, hit back: “The papers published by Sage today show that the phased, cautiousof a limited number of pupils to classrooms has been a carefully considered decision based on the best scientic and medical advice.“My department continues to engage with the school, college and nursery sectors and I am enormously grateful for all the planning and preparation they are doing, alongside local authorities and academy trusts.“The welfare of children remains at the very heart of everything we are doing because being able to be back in school will benefit not just their education but also their wellbeing.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The shock will come when that scheme ends, bringing a new wave of unemployment — predicted by some to be in double digits by the end of the year.As a result, the tax that we rely on to pay for essential public ­services such as the NHS, police, teachers and even MPs dwindles catastrophically.This will put a colossal strain on government funds. One result will be a reduction in finance for public services — and never-ending cuts.The gloomiest assessment of our future is that we don’t need to worry about whether restaurants will reopen, or fear airlines going bust, because we won’t be able to afford to eat out or holiday anywhere.We will be working hard to stand still, which is a rotten position to be in.At the moment, the Government is paying the wages of ten million ­people and giving them loans to survive. That was and is the right thing to do.But the cost to the public — ­estimated to be £BILLION this year — will be vast. And it’s growing all the time.Whichever way you look at it, with lockdown we have swallowed a very poisonous pill. In fact, it may go down in history as the greatest act of self-harm any civilisation has ever inflicted upon itself.Yes, it has saved some people, although not enough of the elderly living in care homes.But we have created a financial burden on the country that will last a generation. The economy is in freefall. It contracted . per cent in March, which is the biggest decline on record. Forget a recession — some say we face a depression.Usually this means higher public borrowing, higher taxes and an end to triple-lock pensions.Whatever happens, let’s just say that Boris Johnson’s election pledge not to raise income tax, National Insurance contributions or VAT for five years is on thin ice.Butthe Government tries to cover this exceptional cost from the current economy we will crash — and we will all be worse off.Rather than start taxing everyone to the hilt, I can see a better solution — with interest rates at rock bottom levels, theGovernment should borrow the money instead, becausetaxes rise too quickly it will halt growth. And growth in the economy is the single most important step to recovery.So we need to borrow, and spread the debt over a long period of  to  years, like the old wartime bonds, to cover the short-term shortfall. If we borrow over a long enough period we could actually increase spending in the short term to incentivise growth.Andwe bounce back, we can pay off our debt more quickly.We just need to get out of lockdown to get this process started.Shops and businesses must open up and start trading again. And we have to get the schools open.People cannot worktheir kids are not in school or in high-quality childcare.If trains and buses are too crowded for people to get to work, we have to find other ways to travel, or work from homewe can.But, perhaps most importantly, we have to accept that this virus is here and it’s not going away.We have to protect the most vulnerable, and those at risk should remain in lockdown for their own safety.The rest of us must take responsibility for ourselves. We need to keep social distance, wear facemasks, wash our hands and stay at homewe have symptoms. We must not take risks.But the quicker people get back to work, the more the recession can be moderated — and we all have a part to play in that.AS proposals go, the one by the man who set out five sausages like fingers on a plate, with his grandmother’s ring on the fourth one, could have been more romantic.Although he also wrote, “Will you marry me ” in HP Sauce on some toast.Presumably this man understands his girlfriend well enough to know what she likes.And when she stopped laughing, I’m guessing she probably said yes.After all, it’s the thought that counts.THIS week, something wonderful happened.It was announced that Captain Tom Moore will be awarded a knighthood after raising a remarkable £million for NHS charities.Cpt Tom, who just turned  and has been promoted to honorary colonel, said on Good Morning Britain he is “thrilled that Her Majesty has chosen poor little me to be knighted”, adding: “It really is a great honour and something I never ever anticipated.“It never, ever entered my head that something like that could happen to me.”But this genuinely could not be more well-deserved.With all the misery we have had to endure over the past few months, this is a little ray of sunshine.Bravo again, Sir Tom.DID anyone  get the giggles at this picture, right, of the Russian nurse wearing only her undies beneath a transparent protective gown Hospital chiefs were not amused and ­punished the nurse for “non- compliance with the requirements for medical clothing”.ONE of the many revelations of lockdown is what a dferent place the House of Commons is without most MPs being there in person.There are far fewer places for people to hide without the armies of grown men and women braying and shouting over each other.As a result, a new type of order is prevailing.The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, actually threatened to kick out Health Secretary Matt Hancock after he interrupted Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister’s Questions.Hoyle treated Matt Hancock like a naughty schoolboy – which doesn’t feel right.But respect is earned and should be mutual.Perhaps one silver lining of lockdown will be a more respectful atmosphere in the Commons.I’VE been reflecting this week on what I’ve learned during the pandemic.Yes, I could share my theories here about human kindness and human idiocy, both of which have been on display in abundance over the past couple of months.Many of us have had time to think about what really matters and what doesn’t.We probably all have a mental list of things we most value from the “old” le, as well as silver linings and the benefits of the new way we have been living.But as we enter the ninth week of lockdownmy main conclusion, after a good deal of thought, is this: Women really do have superpowers.Most of the women I know are managing to . . . work from home, look after and home-school their children, cook and clean, shop for essentials, provide entertainment and keep up their family’s spirits, clap for carers and of course bake banana bread once a week.Now that’s what I call multi-tasking.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Aum Supreme Truth believed the terrorist strike would trigger a nuclear war between superpowers and wanted a remote location to hide out so their preparations would go unnoticed.Two scouts, Kiyohide Hayakawa and Yoshihiro Inoue, were sent ahead in April  with the task of finding a remote spot in the Australian Outback.The pair eventually settled for Banjawam Station, , square kilometres of mulga and saltbush, about  hours drive north-east of Perth.The cult paid less than , for the land.Over the next  months the group used the area to conduct experiments with the sarin nerve agent, a chemical weapon developed in Nazi Germany.The experiments led to the attack on the Tokyo underground system in  which killed  people and poisoned another , commuters.A group of the sect’s  members, including their blind leader Shoko Asahara arrived in Perth on tourist visas on September , and immediately caught the eye of customs officials, according to the Australian Federal Police magazine Platypus.Despite arriving on tourist visas the group had brought with them mining equipment and chemicals including hydrochloric acid in sake bottles and glass jars marked “hand soap”.Detective Leading Senior Constable Mark Creighton told the magazine an AFP officer noted the amount of excess baggage the group was carrying and the jars of acid they claimed were soap.Customs officers seized ammonium chloride, sodium sulphate, perchloric acid and ammonium water, along with laboratory equipment.Creighton said customs became suspicious of the group for other reasons.He said: “Accompanying the group were six or seven Japanese girls who were under the age of .“Their parents werent with them and the thing that struck us at the time was that this might have been child abuse because Banjawarn Station is miles from anywhere.”Despite the suspicions the group were allowed to continue through customs.Arriving at Banjawam Station the group set up a laboratory in the homestead’s kitchen, complete with evaporators, Bunsen burners, beakers, a rock crushing machine and its own generator once the lab had been set up most of the group then flew home.Those members who stayed bought chemicals locally to replace those that had been confiscated as well as earth moving equipment from Kalgoorlie, km south of  the homestead.While all this was going on the AFP were carrying out their own investigation and had contacted the National Police Agency of Japan and received information on the cult as well as Shoko Asahara’s criminal record.Asahara had founded Shinrikyo Aum in Tokyo in  and at its height is said to have had tens of thousands of followers.In  the leader declared himself to be Christ, identying himself as the “Lamb of God”.Among the sect’s strange beliefs and rituals, followers were encouraged to drink ml of Asahara’s bath water, which cost .They were also encouraged to drink his blood which was said to give them enlightenment.He prophesised a third world war, which in his mind would be initiated by the US and which only Aum members would survive.The sect gained international infamy on March ,  when it launched the sarin attack on five Tokyo train stations.The group had sold the homestead the previous August at a loss of , but following the attack, which drew worldwide attention, the new owners of the station contacted local police.Investigators carried out searches and testing at the site, finding evidence of sarin experiments that had been conducted on sheep at the property.They also found evidence the sect had plans to build a nuclear weapon and had used an excavator to dig up uranium.Asahara was executed along with Kiyohide Hayakawa and Yoshihiro Inoue, the pair who had scouted Banjawarn, as well as Seiichi Endo, the so-called head scientist, and nine other sect members in July .Aum Shinrikyo was classied as a terrorist organisation and still exists under the name Aleph."},{"url":null,"title":"steve coogan

Juggling my work with that of four daughters aged six to  is a challenge. We’re the lucky ones, too, with plenty of space, devices, and so on.Many families don’t have these advantages, and so their children face an uphill struggle to keep up with those who do. Right now millions of kids are falling behind their advantaged classmates, for reasons completely out of their control, and in spite of their parents’ best efforts.The past decade has seen good progress in closing the learning gap between children. Common sense reforms have allowed all kids to benefit from better discipline, richer curriculums, and tougher exams, but those from more deprived backgrounds have benefitted most.However, the coronavirus crisis is putting these gains and more at risk, even though our teachers have performed near-miracles during lockdown.With minimal warning and no extra money, they went from educating and safeguarding millions of children in classrooms to doing so remotely.They did all this while keeping schools open to children at risk and those of key workers, and looking after their own children at home too! We should all be immensely proud of this.Nothing beats being in a class with a great teacher, though. It’s why I’m so keen that kids get back to school as soon as possible, and for the teaching unions to stop blocking this.It’s also why I love the idea of catch-up summer schools during the summer holidays.I can think of loads of reasons why dferent children would benefit from being in school for some or all of the holiday period. Some might need academic support in key subjects. Others might have faced particular traumas during lockdown and need pastoral support or counselling.It could be as simple as wanting to get back into some kind of routine with familiar faces outside of their immediate family. And of course, having access to summer school would make it easier for many families to get in or back to work as we kickstart the economy in this strange new world.Butwe’re going to make it all work we must use our common sense. We should keep things optional, flexible, and fully-funded.It must be optional for teachers and pupils. Staff have been busier than ever. Kids and their families will want to enjoy any freedoms from lockdown by then. A decent break is vital to ensure everyone is refreshed for a challenging start to the school year in September.However I’m confident though that there will still be enough staff - and community volunteers - for summer catch-up. And schools are perfectly placed to get in the kids who need it most.But we shouldn’t expect it to run like normal school. These are not normal times and we won’t have all the usual staff to hand. We have to work around these, and the needs of the children that come in.And that’s why it must be properly funded by the government. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing well, and asking people to give up their summer to pull together something of quality will cost.Get it right though, and catch-up summer schools could make all the dference to kids and families in a time of need. It would also be another great example of the dference schools can make when times are tough.Where can I sign up !To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It gives the impression that the decision to walk away from the Royal Family was Meghan’s.“The reality is Harry drove that decision. The book will make that clear and explain why it had to happen.

The decision that I have made for my we and I to step back, is not one I made lightly.“It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges.

It squares pretty well with the models we have.”He had previously predicted Sweden would have herd immunity by May.The study examined around , tests from across the country but only figures from Stockholm were published.Health Agency officials stressed though that herd immunity was not a goal in itself but a strategy to slow the virus spreading enough so that health workers could cope, rather than suppress it completely.They added countries which had implemented a lockdown faced the potential for a second outbreak to flare up.The World Health Organisationhas warned against a herd immunity policy.It said last week studies from around the world had found antibodies in only - percent of the population, results in line with recent findings in Spain and France.Professor of Infectious Medicine at Uppsala University Bjorn Olsen has been a critic of Sweden’s response to the pandemic, calling it a “dangerous and unrealistic” approach to dealing with Covid-.He said after the findings had been released: “I think herd immunity is a long way off,we ever reach it.”Coronavirus testing in Sweden has largely been restricted to hospitalised cases and health care workers with weekly testing running at less than a third of the government’s target of ,, well below that of most western European countries.Helen Gluckman, , wept  as she related how her -year-old father died of a Covid- infection contracted in a nursing home after untested patients were admitted there.She said: We dont know what will happen when other countries open up, but right now one cant help but think Sweden has really failed.“There are more than , dead now. That is a horrible number.”The number of recorded cases in Sweden has now broken the , mark with , deaths, more than three times the combined total of Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland.Olsen says Sweden has done “too little, too late”.Critics also say the government’s policy has been catastrophic for the elderly.The government has defended its policy saying Swedens per capita death toll, which is now the highest in the world, did not result from the lack of a national lockdown.Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hellengren said most Swedes had voluntarily minimised their social interactions and movements outside the home.She said: “The Swedes have really changed their behaviour.”"},{"url":null,"title":"open air activities to reopen from june","story":"The PM will ease restrictions on open-air activities in the latest step on the road back to normal le.Mr Johnson is expected to give the go-ahead for market stalls, car sales centres and garden fetes from next month.National Trust parks will also be told they can open for business providing indoor attractions remain out of bounds.Even some non-essential shops could be given the all-clear to open again. Mr Johnson wants to salvage the summer for families confined for the past nine weeks.And he is keen to make the countryside accessible again — but in “slow steps”.A senior Government source said: “It is clear from the scientic evidence that the rate of infection is much less likely outdoors.

But Chancellor Rishi Sunak has voiced frustration over the pace of the unlocking.He is increasingly anxious about the damage from the lack of economic activity and the cost of furloughing workers.Mr Sunak suggested to Tory MPs in a conference call that the PM was being too cautious, saying said: “Somehow Greece and Italy are opening up. This country can’t be the only place where people can’t go and have a drink in the pub.”But Mr Johnson is unlikely to give the all-clear to pubs and restaurants this week.He is considering letting outdoor cafes resume business with strict limits on table spacing and numbers.

It is believed the Marconi radio — used by operator Jack Phillips with morse code — will help add to the ­Belfast-built liner’s legacy.Until now a joint UK-US treaty protected the ship from exploitation because it is a mass grave.But controversially, American firm RMS Titanic Inc, which already owns items of the ship’s memorabilia, can now send up to three unmanned robots down to the ruin, ,ft below the waves of the Atlantic.The Titanic sank in April , ­killing , people, after hitting an ­iceberg, and Dr Robert Blyth, senior ­curator at the National Maritime Museum in ­Green­wich, South East London, wants the vessel left alone.He says it would reveal little we do not already know about the disaster.He said: “Preserving the site as a memorial to the dead and monitoring the gradual disappearance of the wreck would seem the most respectful way of remembering the Titanic.”TV documentary maker Robert Strange, who carried out extensive research while writing his book Who Sank The Titanic  The Final Verdict, said: “It should be left untouched.”With thousands of items already having been recovered from the ship, TV expert Robert has drawn up a list of ten objects still inside the wreck that he would like to see salvaged.Chief baker Charles Joughin sent his  bakers to the leboats with four loaves each to “provision” the vessels and helped third-class passengers to the boat deck.He refused a place in the le rafts and ed to his cabin, gulped several large whiskies and, despite being drunk, somehow got into the water and survived.One of his duties was “sounding the ship” by throwing a lead weight on a line into water in the bilges.He was probably the first person to realise the Titanic was doomed and was last seen wandering the corridors holding his weight, trying to report to the captain.When billionaire Astor’s drowned body was recovered, his effects were listed as a gold watch, gold and diamond cufflinks, a three-stone diamond ring, and around , US dollars.Astor, who owned a fabulous collection of watches, rings and other jewellery, must have left a lot behind in his cabin.This was used by -year-old able seaman Frederick Fleet to warn that he had spotted an iceberg.“I got an answer straight away,” he later told the Titanic inquiry. “I reported it as soon as I saw it . . . an iceberg straight ahead.”A copy of the Titanic’s Board of Trade Passenger Certicate, signed by a ­surveyor after a sea trial on April , , remains on board.This certied the ship safe to carry passengers, despite the hurried final construction.The first-class gym on board included an electric camel-riding machine for wealthy passengers.In an age of female delicacy, it was reportedly “popular with the ladies”.Any coal shovel from the bowels of the engine room, where crewmen laboured in darkness and danger to keep the ship’s ­generators operating, despite the rising water in the boiler rooms. The death toll was highest among these brave men.Each boiler room had a colour-coded warning-lights system – white for full speed, blue for slow and red for stop. On the night of the disaster, the doors began closing and the red lights came on. Leading stoker Frederick ­Barrett was first to react and order, “Close all dampers” to cut air to the boiler fires.The only Frenchman among the musicians who reportedly played to the end to try to keep passengers calm.Aged just  when he drowned, Roger’s body was never recovered.Mining tycoon Ben was always immaculately dressed – complete with gold tie pin. Having helped his mistress into a leboat, he reputedly waited for death with other first-class passengers, popped a rose into his buttonhole, and said: “We’ve dressed up in our best and are ­prepared to go down like gentlemen.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Iran, for example, has deployed a similar strategy.For years, we have known China censors what its people read and say online. Now we know authorities began censoring keywords and discussion of the outbreak weeks before its severity was acknowledged.Already in late December, doctors in Wuhan began to see patients suffering from an unusual pneumonia.Dr Li Wenliang,  who reported it to colleagues, was forced by police to sign a confession denouncing his communication as “illegal behaviour”.Dr Li later “died of the outbreak”.A number of critical journalists then went missing, along with Ren Zhiqiang, a well-known property tycoon critical of the regime.A month after his disappearance, China announced his official detention and investigation.Beijing is now saying that it will allow the WHO to visit for an investigation — but “not yet”.So how should we deal with China going forwards — especially since an inept, repressive officialdom has responded to international criticism with an aggressive misinformation campaign, completely misjudging the mood around the world China, as the world’s second-biggest economy, will remain an important export market for our goods and services.Even the Trump administration in the US does not want to close off a lucrative market for American farmers.It needs to abide by global rulesAs Trade Secretary, I tried to build a constructive relationship with my Chinese counterparts to help our businesses sell more to them and support jobs here.ButChina wants to be a partner in the global trading system, it needs to abide by global rules.This will be a major challenge as we face the inevitable task of reforming the World Trade Organization. When it comes to our national security, as The Sun on Sunday so clearly set out in recent weeks, we cannot afford to have it linked to other economic or political considerations.That is why I, along with a number of fellow MPs, voted against the Government’s plans to include Chinese tech firm Huawei in our G data network.China is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.That choice is in their hands. Our national security lies in ours.We all hope China will make the necessary reforms and take the right path.But hope is not a good basis for foreign policy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its not a race against the other guys. Its a race against the virus disappearing, and against time.“We said earlier in the year that there was an  per cent chance of developing an effective vaccine by September.“But at the moment, there’s a  per cent chance that we get no result at all.“We’re in the bizarre position of wanting Covid to stay, at least for a little while. But cases are declining.He said that of the , people who had been recruited to test the vaccine – some who will be given an placebo – he expected fewer than  people to catch the virus.But he warned thatfewer than  test positive, then the results may be useless.Prof Hill added: “I wouldn’t book a holiday in October on the back of these announcements, put it that way.”Business Secretary Alok Sharma suggested half the UK population could be given the jab this autumn,the trial was a success, at a Downing Street press conference on May .Prof Hill warned: “There’s a danger of over-promising here. This is the way I usually say it: this is our ambition. There are multiple risks. Its never been done before. We dont knowwe can do it. We think we can.The results of an earlier trial conducted by the Oxford team are due to be released early next month when , volunteers took part in a test in April, during the peak of the pandemic.The Oxford researchers are just one of eight human trials for a potential Covid- vaccine.There are four in China, two in the US and one in Germany in addition to the one in Oxford.The Oxford team has already arranged for further trials to take place in the US and are also currently in talks with other countries where the virus is still spreading.Prof Hill’s current research is based on his earlier search for a vaccine to combat malaria.Over two decades researchers at the Jenner Institute worked out how to alter the genetic code of a familiar virus, first to neutralise its harmful effects and then to make it imitate a deadlier disease.The harmless virus is then injected into the bloodstream which causes the body to produce an immune response which gives long-lasting protection.While there has not yet been a malaria vaccine, a colleague of Prof Hill, Professor Sarah Gilbert was able to mody the same chimpanzee virus to vaccinate against MERS, a coronavirus, which then progressed onto human trials in the UK.When Covid- began to spread, Prof Gilbert carried out a project to seethe Oxford technique could work on the new disease and tests in April on six rhesus macaque monkeys found that after being exposed to the disease all were healthy a month later.Should the next phase of human trials be a success the Government has said the “people in the UK will get the first access, helping to protect thousands of lives”. "},{"url":null,"title":"ramadan mubarak kareem maradan 2020 meaning","story":"The phrases have dferent meanings and are used at dferent times.Happy Ramadan can be translated to Ramadan Mubarak, which also means blessed Ramadan.Ramadan Kareem means may Ramadan be generous to you but there is some debate as toit should be used during Ramadan.The greetings are dferent as Ramadan Mubarak offers a blessed or happy Ramadan to the person it is exchanged with.Whereas Ramadan Kareem has debate around its use as it asks Ramadan to be generous to the other person.Saudi Arabian scholar Sheikh Al-Uthaymeen told the Express: “It should be said ‘Ramadan Mubarak’, or whatever is similar to it, because it is not Ramadan itself that gives so that it can be kareem , in fact it is Allah who placed the grace in it, and made it a special month, and a time to perform one of the pillars of Islam.”Ramadan Mubarak is the most commonly used of the two as it was originally used by the prophet Muhammad.However, others believe using Ramadan Kareem is fine because they say the phrase represents the blessings that Allah gives his followers during the month.Both greetings can be used throughout the whole month of Ramadan but Ramadan Mubarak tends to be the more commonly used of the two.Typically, the start of the month is welcomed with greetings such as Ramadan Mubarak.On the last day of Ramadan, which is Eid-al-fitr, the greeting changes to Eid Mubarak.The last day of Ramadan in  will be May .Traditionally, Ramadan begins with the sighting of the crescent moon, which usually appears one night after the new moon, meaning the start date cant be predicted.Eid al-Fitr works in exactly the same way.The sighting of the new crescent moon brings the end of Ramadan and the onset of the month of Shawwal, the tenth of the Islamic Hijri calendar.There is debate as to whether the idea of a moon sighting should refer to you physically witnessing the moon where you are, which could be dictated by factors such as the weather, or whether to defer to sightings in Saudi Arabia or other regions.Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, is a period of fasting observed by Muslims across the globe to celebrate the best of times.It celebrates the first time the Koran was revealed to Muhammad, according to Islamic belief.Fasting is only obligatory for healthy adult Muslims, anyone who is suffering from an illness, travelling, elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, chronically ill or menstruating are exempt from the practice.The fasting period, during which Muslims are not allowed to eat or drink, is from dawn to sunset and Muslims engage in increased prayer activity.Muslims often try and practice an increased self-discipline during the month of Ramadan.In  Ramadan started on the evening of Thursday, April  and ends in the evening of Saturday, May .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But as tests continue, it is not yet certain that will be the case – and the minister’s vow could set back NHS access to a vaccine developed where, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres. Research and policy officer Roz Scourse said: “There’s no guarantee that the Oxford vaccine will be the one. What happensit’s not,you’re saying things like that  “That nationalistic view is something we’re really concerned about. We’re also hearing similar noises in the US. “We don’t know where the ­effective products are going to come from – we all need to commit to sharing now, becauseit comes from another country, the UK risks not having access to it.” The medical charity raised fears after the UK and US resisted plans for a “patent pool” that would mean sharing a successful vaccine between countries so anyone could manufacture the successful formula. Mr Sharma made his comments in a No briefing last week after AstraZeneca signed a deal to manufacture the Oxford vaccine. He said the UK would have access to the vaccines first but would also ensure it would be ­available to developing nations “at the lowest possible cost”. MSF also said the UK has failed to attach conditions to vaccine ­development funds given to pharma firms, to prevent them from profiteering on any drugs they develop. Ms Scource said: “The public is paying twice for this system – once for funding research and development, again when pharma companies are getting the patent. Unless you’re attaching conditions, this is what’s going to happen. High prices could cripple health budgets.” These fears were echoed by Diarmuid McDonald of campaign group Just Treatment, which last year helped force a pharma firm to drop the price of cystic fibrosis drugs the NHS had said it could not afford.  AstraZeneca has promised not to make a profit during the pandemic. But Mr McDonald said: “There’s a chance we’ll have to vaccinate millions of people every year. If we start seeing AstraZeneca at that point charging high prices, that turns into billions of pounds a year for the NHS every year.” A Government spokesman said: “We are clear that any successful vaccine must be available globally, to give us the best chance of stopping this pandemic. “That is why the UK is the biggest donor to the efforts of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to find a vaccine.

Boris Johnson’s top aide was spotted in Houghall Woods a fortnight after the first sighting. He was first spotted in Durham on April  while self isolating with the coronavirus. Ato London saw him back at work on April . But by April  he was back in Durham. On the second visit, fellow walkers spotted Mr Cummings at the local beauty spot. The adviser – tonight facing growing calls to quit – claimed Mr Cummings commented as he passed by: “Aren’t the bluebells lovely ”  The revelations came as:A YouGov poll showed  per cent of people think he broke the rules and  per cent think he should resign. Mr Johnson - under growing pressure to sack him – reiterated his support. A tetchy Mr Cummings clashed with press outside his home, insisting: “It’s a question of doing the right thing. It’s not about what you guys think.”The Government was thrown into chaos yesterday after we reported that the PM’s chief-of-staff broke lockdown rules.  Downing Street said he had needed his relatives in the North East to help with childcare after he and his we Mary Wakefield fell ill. But the claims were mired in confusion after it emerged the couple continued to look after their four-year-old son themselves in Durham. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries cast further doubt when she told the No  daily briefing today that the only exception to the rules wasthere was “an extreme risk to le”. A joint investigation by the Sunday Mirror and Observer can reveal that Mr Cummings was spotted for a second time apparently breaching the rules – after he had recovered from Covid-. It comes as the number of Britons to die from the virus rose by  yesterday to ,. A local couple, who did not want to be named, reported seeing Mr Cummings on Sunday April . One told the Mirror: “We were shocked and surprised to see him because the last time we did was earlier in the week in Downing Street. “We thought ‘He’s not supposed to be here during the lockdown’. We thought ‘What double standards, one rule for him as a senior adviser to the Prime Minister and another for the rest of us’.” The witness said Mr Cummings, wearing his trademark beanie hat and outdoor clothes, was walking with a woman believed to be his we Mary. The locals stepped back a couple of metres, in line with social distancing. Ministers insisted that Mr Cummings had “stayed put” at his family property in Durham during his -day self-isolation period. But Robin Lees, , a retired chemistry teacher from Barnard Castle, claimed he saw Mr Cummings and his family walking by the River Tees in the town before getting into a car around lunch time on April . Although he may have completed his period of self-isolation, strict lockdown rules were still in place and the family were  miles from his parents’ home. Mr Lees said: “I was a bit gobsmacked to see him. They looked asthey’d been for a walk by the river. It didn’t seem right because I assumed he would be in London. “Of course he should resign now. You don’t take the virus from one part of the country to another. “It just beggars belief to think you could actually drive when the advice was stay home, save lives. It couldn’t have been clearer.”  When askedhe was going to consider resigning following the allegations, Mr Cummings said: “Obviously not.” The architect of the Vote Leave campaign added: “You guys are probably as right about that as you are about Brexit, remember how right you were ” When challenged by a reporter who said his decision to self-isolate in Durham “didn’t look good”, he said: “Who cares about good looks  It’s a question of doing the right thing. It’s not about what you guys think. A No  spokesman described the Mirroraposs story on Mr Cummings travelling to self-isolate in Durham as inaccurate - despite confirming it earlier in the day. They added: Today they are writing more inaccurate stories including claims that Mr Cummings ed to Durham after ing to work in Downing Street on  April. We will not waste our time answering a stream of  allegations about Mr Cummings from campaigning newspapers. Downing Street also denied Durham Police had spoken to Mr Cummings or his family, following their confirmation they had visited the property on March .  But the force has stood by their statement, and said “officers explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice”. Mr Cummings’ father, Robert, , has also tried to claim the scandal was a “pack of lies” when telephoned by the Sunday Mirror yesterday. Durham’s Police and Crime Commissioner has said officers acted appropriately in visiting the property. A Durham Police spokesman said: “On Tuesday, March , our officers were made aware that Dominic Cummings had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city. “At the request of Mr Cummings’ father, an officer made contact the following morning by telephone. “During that conversation, Mr Cummings’ father confirmed that his son had travelled with his family from London to the North-East and was self-isolating in part of the property. “Durham Constabulary deemed that no further action was required. However, the officer did provide advice in relation to security issues.” And the PCC from neighbouring Northumbria has demanded the Prime Minister sack his chief adviser. Kim McGuinness said: “The Prime Minister should stop delaying, do the right thing and sack him.” Attorney General Suella Braverman breached all the usual conventions of senior Government law officers by defending Mr Cummings, suggesting he will escape prosecution.  On Twitter she said: “Protecting one’s family is what any good parent does. “The @DowningStreet statement claries the situation and it is wholly inappropriate to politicise it. But opposition parties said Mr Cummings must go. SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford said there seemed to have been a “cover up” over his whereabouts. Labour demanded that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill hold an urgent inquiry into Mr Cummings’ actions. Labour’s Rachel Reeves said: “The British people have made important and painful sacrices to support the national effort, including being away from family in times of need. “It is therefore vital that the Government can reassure the public that its most senior figures have been adhering to the same rules as everyone .”"},{"url":null,"title":"labour calls urgent inquiry dominic","story":"NewsLabour calls for urgent inquiry into Dominic Cummings’ -mile lockdown tripLabours shadow minister for the Cabinet Office Rachel Reeves has demanded an inquiry into Dominic Cummings trip to his parents home in Durham during the coronavirus lockdownShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  MAY NewsBoris Johnson has come under pressure to sack Dominic Cummings over the trip \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

As part of the Governmentaposs -page blueprint, ministers  have set out a roadmap for how the lockdown in England might come to an end. Since May  youaposve been allowed to leave your house for an unlimited amount of exercise. But when will lockdown end and what could change from June   When will lockdown end  The answer is no one actually knows and hard-won progress in lting lockdown could be reversedthe virus starts to spread again. But Boris Johnson has reportedly told MPs he wants ato “near-normality” by July. Lockdown will only end once the government is satisfied it has complete control of the virusaposs spread around the UK. Which will likely mean a vaccine or effective treatment being in place. While some are hopeful that the Oxford vaccine trials will lead to results that could be seen as early in September, even Mr Johnson has warned that we may be living with this virus vaccineless for some time to come.  So what big changes are coming June   Well potentially very little. As while the Government has set out things it would like to change as early as June  it has said that when it actually gives permission for that to happen will be based on what the spread of the virus, or R rate, is in the community. Butthings go according to the draft timetable a number of big changes could happen.  Could schools re-open for more children  If the Government gets its way then yes. Boris Johnsonaposs plan is for Englandaposs primary schools to widen the number of pupils they are taking at the earliest by June  – after half term. The plan will see classrooms reopen in stages, beginning with reception, Year  and Year . Years  to  wouldlater in June. But teaching unions are demanding more detail about the science behind reopening schools. And headteachers have warned that many donapost believe their schools can be safely socially distanced.

Secondary pupils in years  and , could go back in some limited form a few weeks later, but secondary schools are not expected to open fully until September.  Will shops reopen on June   Some will, some wonapost. The Government has announced that the phasedof non-essential stores will come around this time. But what will reopen will depend on the size of the establishment - can they make social distancing work safely  Weaposre expecting guidance closer to the time about which businesses will be covered in this section.

Armchair football fans without Sky or BT Sport could be able to watch some live Premier League matches on free-to-air TV. Broadcasters have previously been banned from screening matches kicking off at pm on Saturdays amid fears fans would opt to stay in and watch TV rather than attend a game. But with matches due to take place behind closed doors when the season resumes amid the coronavirus pandemic, there is no longer a reason for the protection.  What about cafes and restaurants  Cafes and restaurants and other so-called higher-risk businesses and public places must remain closed until the beginning of July at the earliest, the latest official guidance says. They may be able to reopen slightly soonerthey have outside seating areas that can be properly distanced. But the vast majority will be closed for some time. And pubs and staycations  Despite earlier advice that pubs would have to wait longer than even restaurants and cafes, pubs were thrown a leline last week. Environment Secretary George Eustice said he wanted pubs to tentatively start gradually opening in July with social distancing in place.

I’ve been ­interviewing teachers this week about schools and lockdown. And I made the mistake of asking one about when schools would ­“reopen” and they would go back to work. A killer pause. Then I was gently but firmly corrected. Schools haven’t closed. To say otherwise is an insult. Have you not done your homework  I tell you. In that instant I was ­transported back to Grimes Dyke Primary School, east Leeds, where I had to confess to Mrs Nancy Coverdale, the loveliest of all my teachers, that I hadn’t forgotten my swimming kit but hidden it in the cloakroom because I hated swimming. Still do. Those tellings-off were always ­justied. Like the one I got this week. This gentleman who I was clumsily ­interviewing was absolutely right. Schools have been open all the way through. Even teachers who are self-isolating have been grafting. It’s disingenuous to say the argument – whipped up by elements of the media spoiling for a row, and Boris Johnson and the Treasury looking for scapegoats – is about going back to work. Believe me, teachers desperately want schools back to normal but not when the risks are this high. They’re not sunning it or strolling round the garden centre. They’re ­working. My mum taught all her ­working le so I know about the hours, the terrible pressure, the impossible targets, the sheer workload. Anyone who thinks that job is finishing at pm, two weeks off at Easter and six in the summer is deluded. It’s often heartbreaking work. And it’s not just about lessons and marking. It’s making sure the kids are getting enough to eat. That they’re clothed properly. That they’re safe. It is a hell of a job. And very quietly they’ve been getting on with it.  But now we’re told they won’t go back to normal because the unions are digging their heels in. That’s just not true. They want to make sure we’re not rushing it. That no one, y’know, dies. Rightly, we won’t stand for anyone criticising the NHS frontline staff but teachers have been forgotten in all this. Forgotten. How can this happen  I can still remember all of mine.

So much for a leading representative of what Boris Johnson likes to call the People’s Government. This is not a government of the people – it is an elitist rabble pushed around by rule- breaker-in-chief Mr Cummings. If Mr Johnson really believed in the national interest, he would dismiss Mr Cummings instantly. That he clings on to him shows either the PM has no backbone, or he cares not one jot for the feelings of the British people. Mr Cummings has laid the foundations of his own downfall. Mr Johnson should now bow to the inevitable. And get shot of him sooner rather than later. Keep kids safe All prime ministers make mistakes. Britain’s tragedy is that Boris Johnson does not learn from his. Lives would have been saved had he not made earlier errors. The PM is risking making another.

The £ bill works out at £. a day – just p more than a large Big Mac meal in McDonald’s. The bargain end-terrace property has been listed to let in the proud former mining village of Horden, Co Durham. Experts believe it is the cheapest family home to rent in the UK for many years. The “spacious” double-glazed property, just a short stroll from a beach and near two schools, features two double bedrooms, fitted bathroom and two reception rooms. The s home is a whopping  per cent cheaper than the average £,-a-month cost of a two-bed property in London’s exclusive Mayfair. But some locals issued a warning to would-be tenants that certain streets in the village were plagued with Asbo yobs. Former primary school teacher Doug Langan, , said: “There is a lot to like about Horden. There’s a great community spirit and it’s right on the coast.” But he added of the area where the house stands: “Some of the houses are owned by retired miners who have been there  years but others have gone to rack and ruin. £ is cheap but you will get what you pay for.” Fth Street, just  yards from Durham’s Heritage Coast, has proved a hit with ­families searching for a budget base. The low-cost let could even be popular with commuters in larger towns able to work from home and looking to save a fortune. Graeme Wetherell, , who moved to Horden aged ten, said: “Strangers from other parts of the country have moved here because it is so cheap.

Government advice clearly states that those who are displaying symptoms should isolate at home to avoid passing the disease on.A YouGov poll found % believe he should quit, while % said he had broken the rules.Cummings himself has denied any wrongdoing, and this evening Transport Secretary Grant Shapps appeared to rewrite the rules in order to defend him.It sparked a huge public backlash, with #sackcummimgs trending on Twitter.For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here NHS doctor Meenal Viz tweeted: If only our government had acted to protect doctors and nurses as quickly as they have done to protect Dominic Cummings. And solicitor Kirsty McGuinness - whose husband is a nurse - questioned why Cummings was allowed to act dferently to everyone . She wrote: My husband, a nurse, had covid- at the start of lockdown. What did he do  Isolated for  days. What did I,  our  kids, do  Isolated for  days. What did we not do  Leave the house. Get in our car. Visit anyone. Visit our parents. Dominic Cummings has to resign. Labour has called for a full investigation into the incident.  Facing questions from the media at todayaposs daily briefing, Mr Shapps stuttered: If youaposre in a position where youaposve got a young child and youaposre worried about the welfare of that child then clearly being somewhere where other members of the family can assist, then that may be the best place for you. He said that Cummings has the Prime Ministeraposs full support, and added: Mr Cummings is in the public eye but the reality is that the four-year-old childaposs welfare is the important thing.  Mr Shapps said itaposs for an inidual to make a decision on how best to practice lockdown measures - which has not been the message up to now. Shadow minister for the Cabinet Office Rachel Reeves wrote in a letter to Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill: The British people have made important and painful sacrices to support the national effort, including being away from family in times of need. It is therefore vital that the Government can reassure the public that its most senior figures have been adhering to the same rules as everyone .

Norman and Shirley Milne, both , passed away eight days apart. Relatives had installed a camera in Norman’s room at Sherrell House Care Home in Essex, which they say shows staff tending him without basic protective gear like masks and gloves. Son Steve Milne, , said: “Last week we had a double funeral for my parents. I feel numb, I don’t think it’s properly hit me yet. “I feel guilty because we put them in the home but we feel like the way they were cared for was either naive or negligent.” He has called in human rights lawyers and instructed them to fight for answers over the couple’s treatment. They are among an estimated , care home residents to die from the virus – a quarter of the national toll. Ministers have been blasted for failing to provide staff with testing and PPE – and their policy of releasing patients with the virus into care homes. Steve said: “The Government were slow to act and the message that was sent out from the start was that older people in care homes were expendable.” Norman and Shirley, who had dementia, moved to the care home in Chigwell last year from their house in nearby Buckhurst Hill. They had been married for  years and had six grandchildren. Former nursery boss Shirley was admitted to Harlow Hospital on April  a few days after showing symptoms and passed away four days later.  Norman, a retired electrical technician, was admitted there on April  but a test turned out to be negative. Despite medics’ warnings, he ed to the home. There Steve says his dad was served with an eviction notice because he had raised concerns about his care. The care home said it acted because there was a “breakdown in trust from the family”, they were receiving “persistent emails” and were aware of social media posts.  Hours after receiving the notice on April , Norman was rushed back to hospital.He died of Covid-, sepsis and kidney failure three days later.Steve claims that care home workers failed to use safe practices to protect his father from the virus despite his mother’s death days earlier. The family had installed a camera in his room – with the consent of the home – prior to the lockdown because of previous concerns about his care.  The motion-detected camera enabled relatives to watch live when anyone tended to Norman. They say they witnessed  incidents in  days where care home staff handled Norman without adequate PPE. Steve claims they gave his dad oral medication without gloves – despite the fact he was awaiting the results of a virus test and was symptomatic. Steve, a data analyst from Chingford, North-East London, said: “They’ve admitted that they didn’t use PPE on one occasion, but we’ve got video footage of dozens of occasions when they didn’t use it.”  He said one staff member told him  of the  residents had Covid symptoms at one point. “This was a private care home – we were paying £, a week for their care,” he said. “The blame lies solely at the feet of management, not inidual carers. “They were gambling with my father’s le. I want those responsible held accountable for what they have done.”  Last week  relatives attended the funeral of Shirley and Norman in Buckhurst Hill, ending in Manor Park Cemetery, in East London. Dad-of-one Steve – who has not been paid to speak to the Sunday People – said: “My mum was such a ray of sunshine, she was always so effervescent. As a couple they were so popular, so loved. “We couldn’t be there in their final days, that was taken away from us. This has devastated our close-knit family.”  The family’s solicitors Leigh Day say claims like Steve’s could be the “tip of the iceberg” as grieving loved ones consider action. Emma Jones, a human rights partner at the firm, said: “Norman and Shirley should have been protected from the virus but instead fell victim to the outbreak. It is essential that their family are given answers into what went wrong in their final days. “The only way people like the Milne family and thousands of others will get answers isthe Government agrees to hold a public inquiry or a full and thorough independent investigation.” Excelcare, which runs the home, admits a worker did not wear proper PPE on one occasion while aiding Norman. In a letter to Steve’s family it stated: “Having reviewed your video footage it is clear to see that the nurse who administered your father’s medication on the morning of the April  clearly did not use the required PPE or follow the safe administration of medication. This matter has resulted in disciplinary action.” "},{"url":null,"title":"former marine who sunbathed cooking","story":"NewsFormer marine who sunbathed in cooking oil left with hole in nose from skin cancerWARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES Grandad-of-six Les Chadderton used to sunbathe on helipads but now hes is speaking out to warn others to take the dangers from UV rays more seriouslyShareCommentsByHannah SmithTara Fitzpatrick:,  MAY NewsLes is now making it his mission to make sure people take as many precautions as possible in the sun, especially around his apartment in Tenere \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Les Chadderton had no concerns over harmful UV rays and would happily allow himself to aposfryapos in his downtime in places like Singapore when he joined the military as a young man. But now the grandad-of-six is speaking out to warn others to take the dangers from UV rays more seriously after he says he had a wake up call with his cancer diagnosis.Les realised something was wrong after he noticed a spot on his nose which wouldn’t stop bleeding whenever he towel dried, reports the Daily Record.After a short, five minute consultation with a doctor at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in February , Les was informed he had melanoma. Following a surgery to cut the tumour away in April , cancerous cells remained and so Les had to undergo a second operation to remove them – along with his entire nostril. The procedure, which was carried out in July , left a huge hole in the side of his nose that took months of painful healing. It slowly closed up but he bears a large scar and a misshapen nose from the ordeal. Les decided to share his shocking pictures in a bid to warn people about the importance of wearing adequate sun protection – especially as temperatures rise. Les, who moved from Greater Manchester to Aberdeen, described his ordeal as a “wake up call”. He said: When we were in Singapore and working offshore, Iaposd fall asleep on the helipad right in the sun.  Thataposs how much I thought about my body. I would just lay there and fry. It was crazy. I would come off a night sht when there were no more flights due in and grab some Kraft cooking oil from the galley and spread that on. I came from Greater Manchester and wasn’t used to that level of sun. But I just didnapost think of it back then. This has been a wake up call for me. Hopefully itaposs not too late in my le to have saved me. I look at le completely dferently now. You see a lot of young people on social media during lockdown and they just lie in their gardens all day. I want to emphasise to people now that yeah, itaposs alright to have a nice tan but what happens when it’s too late. Theyaposll try and blame everyone but themselves. Nobody is forcing them to lie in the sun for  hours a day. They take it for granted, like I did. I donapost want this to happen to anyone . I have to try and educate people as best I can. Les joined the  Commando Royal Marines when he was  and was stationed in Arbroath, but travelled all around the world including to Singapore, Malta and even Arctic training leaving him burned off the snow reflection . Les said: When I was in the forces, we couldnapost just buy the sun tan lotion in a shop that you can now.  We travelled the world and were always in the Sun but took no precautions. Even after leaving the Marines at , I didn’t pay any attention to protection from the sun. On holiday I would just walk around in shorts and a vest. Sometimes not even a vest. Sun tan lotion meant nothing to me. Whatever came out of the bag I’d put it on. If we were running out towards the end of the holiday Iaposd mix in some baby oil to make it last. When I look at it now, thataposs how ridiculous it got. That’s how I was caught out. It wasnapost until a spot appeared on his nose which would regularly bleed after being towel dried from a shower, that Les thought anything was wrong. Les said: I went to the dermatology department in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the consultant told me within five minutes that I had skin cancer.  I had to have an operation on my nose to cut away the cancerous cells. It was the same day as my youngest grandson, Laylan, was born. When I went back for a check up there were still cancerous cells so I had a second surgery, where they removed the bad tissue from both nostrils. I still have to get treatment to possibly reconstruct my nose and laser treatment. I’m not out of the woods yet. I got a blemish on my leg the other day and went to the doctors immediately. I went straight into panic mode. Les is now making it his mission to make sure people take as many precautions as possible in the sun, especially around his apartment in Tenere.  And he says his partner Dale White, , has already changed her own sunbathing habits after seeing the ordeal Les went through - and she ensures Les always has lotion on now. Les said: I see people who have been going there for  or  years and they tell me they’ve had problems with their skin and I ask them is it not a wake up call  People no matter their age - kids or adults - need to be educated about sun protection. There is only one outcome really and I’m proof of that. We took pictures of the operation and aftermath just to show how horric the results are. My whole outlook on the sun has changed completely. I didnapost care about the sun burning me at all, but suddenly you get this wake up call and you have to change your ways.

She had rejected his friend request after ing to the UK from holiday – then regretted it. So she sent a message intended for the barista named Bayram... but it went to Bayram Boussada,  – who she had never met. He is a cabbie... and the fluke contact led to a fare of the heart.  After months of internet chat, video calls and finally a face-to-face meeting, they married in Tunisia in January this year. Isabell – who has lost three husbands to illness – has no qualms about their age gap, saying: “I know there are so many cons that go on so I had my doubts and I was sceptical. “I read stories about women like this and I never thought I’d be in this position but he’s never asked me for money, he’s never asked me for anything. He doesn’t careI move there or he comes here, we just want to be together.” Bayram insists he is also head over heels in love and calls Isabell “my gorgeous woman, my soul”. Isabell, a receptionist, was single for four years when she took the trip to Tunisia. She says of her Facebook faux pas: “I added Bayram thinking we’d spoken in the coffee shop. I said ‘We met in the airport’. “He said I had the wrong person, but he still wanted to chat. We started talking and things went from there. “We literally spoke for hours and sometimes we were up till am on the phone. “I knew there was something there before we met face-to-face. “It was like we’d known each other our whole lives.”  The pair first made contact last May. Within months, Bayram started calling Isabell his we. She says: “I saidhe really wanted to marry, he’d have to ask properly. A week later he sent me pictures of a tray of rings and asked me to pick one.” Bayram invited Isabell, from Dymchurch, Kent, to visit him for a fortnight last October. She continues: “When I arrived I met his parents, who were incredible. They set up candles everywhere and got a cake and he proposed to me in front of them. My family were a bit shocked to begin with and told me to be careful, which is natural. “But their attitude is ‘You had it tough in le, so do whatever makes you happy’. “I lost three husbands and they know I need some excitement and love in my le. “They know I’m young at heart and that he makes me happy.”  Isabell’s daughter Emma, , says: “I didn’t have a problem with my mum meeting someone online, but I was a bit dubious to begin with. You hear all sorts of stories about younger men meeting older women and they’re only after one thing. “The thing that worried me was that she was going to another country to meet a stranger. “I was on the phone to her the entire time she went over there – she would do the same for me.” Emma and her siblings didn’t attend the wedding and have never met Bayram. But she adds: “After seeing their connection, I can see how genuine they are. He clearly loves my mum. She’s been through a lot over the years and had lots of losses in le so it’s really nice to see her happy. “I’ve met him over Facetime when Mum’s gone to visit but it’ll be nice to meet him in person. “He is Mum’s husband after all, so it’ll be nice to get to know him on a personal level too.”  Isabell’s heartache began in  when long-term partner George died of a heart attack. She was married for  years to first husband Bill, who died in  – again of a heart attack. In  she met her third husband Tony and was devastated when he was struck down by cancer in . They married in their garden three months before he passed away. After so much heartbreak, Isabell was as surprised as anyone to find herself falling in love – let alone tying the knot with Bayram at a register office in Mahdia, on Tunisia’s east coast. They celebrated with  of his family and friends.Isabell ed home after a fortnight and Bayram hopes to come here on a spousal visa once coronavirus restrictions allow him to travel.Isabell says: “I have family here, ­children and grandchildren, so I don’t want to leave. We’re struggling to get him here with everything going on. “There must be so many people in our position with their partners stuck abroad and finding it hard to get a visa during the Covid- outbreak. “It’s so dficult. Hopefully things will turn around soon. “We’re hoping it may be by June, but who knows. I just can’t wait to get him over here so we can start enjoying time together.” Bayram is itching to make the move too.

What at first appears to be one almighty mash-up between Star Wars and the Muppets is actually a remarkable series of pictures by macro photographer Mofeed Abu Shalwa. And here’s the thing – the -year-old master of close-ups from Saudi Arabia was terried of bugs as a child. Mofeed, a scientic researcher turned nature photographer, explains: “I used to suffer from insect phobia.This fear grew stronger as my classmates used to bring insects with them and, knowing that I’m so fearful of insects, they used to throw them on me as a joke. “My fear only grew stronger over the years. So choosing small worlds’ photography was a way to break the childhood fear. “I wanted to send a message through my photos – to see this beauty and tiny details that can only be seen using camera lenses.” Mofeed has travelled all over the world to photograph insects.

Harris once said that the home was aposhauntedapos by the ghosts of children from an orphanage that previously occupied the site, and to appease the spirits he would buy them toys. Harris bought the home in  for £, after it had been left vacant for years and suffered vandalism as a result.

Cats Protection’s Hands-Free Homing scheme lets you adopt a cat while shelters ­remain shut during the pandemic – and it has helped turn le around for one bored -year-old boy. Cooper and his mum Claire Blekkenhorst fell for black cat Wilfey after seeing his photos and videos. Claire said: “We are so in love with Wilfey. He has bonded so specially with my son and follows him ­everywhere. They’ve become very firm friends and sleep together every night. “For a seven-year-old cat he is super-playful and inquisitive. He has loads of toys but, to be honest, his favourite game is to chase his own tail.” Wilfey was picked from Cats Protection’s Mitcham Homing Centre in London. And Claire and Cooper, from Sutton in Surrey, say he has made staying at home much more fun. “We are so very grateful to Cats Protection for matching us with Wilfey. “We lost our first cat in January and I couldn’t imagine another cat coming into our lives and being adored so much but it turns out it is possible.” If a match is made, the charity does the necessary checks online and once the adoption fee is paid, the cat will be delivered in a Cats Protection van. All cats come neutered, microchipped and with a clean bill of health. Follow-up care calls over the following couple of weeks ensure that the cat and their new owners are happy. The charity’s boss Mark Beazley said: “This is a fantastic scheme, which will not only help to us to find loving homes for cats but can also provide much-needed companionship for ­people at this dficult time.

On royal aides’ advice, her social media was wiped clean in January , two months after the royal engagement. The Tig followed in April that year. But now it’s feared that The Tig was simply replaced – by a potential ticking time bomb. Because Meghan, , reportedly kept writing private diaries during her two tempestuous years inside the Royal Family after her marriage. And as a controversial biography of the renegade royal couple is released – allegedly with their co-operation – Palace sources think it could just be a taste of more explosive revelations. Meghan and Harry, , are desperate to earn a living outside the Royal Family.They have no royal subsidies and are said to be paying back £.million at £, a month over  years for renovations to Frogmore Cottage which was to be their Windsor home.The pair – now renting a £.million LA villa from a film producer pal – have already appeared at a star-studded private gala in Miami for the bank JP Morgan in February this year. And Meghan has ed to showbiz, voicing a Disney nature documentary released in March.  It’s believed any memoirs of Meghan’s years inside a monarchy rocked by a rt between William and Harry and Prince Andrew’s damning Epstein sex scandal links and damaging BBC interview could fetch up to million in a bidding war. One insider said: “The fact they may exist and could contain material to embarrass the Royal Family is enough to make anyone feel uncomfortable, even though right now there is no reason to believe she has plans to publish. “Meghan has always been a tremendous self-publicist. Her account of some of the more dficult times would worry everyone in the royal household.” Royal biographer Ingrid Seward believes the new biography – Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family – could just be testing the water.  “My feeling is it won’t be nearly as revelatory as we think,” she said. “There might be a few titbits in it – but what would be the point in the Sussexes giving away too much in this book when Meghan could write her own story  “Michelle Obama got £million for her book deal, and Meghan could double or triple that. I think she’ll hang out to write her own – making the royal household far more nervous.” While some worry the diaries could fall into the wrong hands despite the couple’s new US £, security detail, for others, Princess Diana’s catastrophic marriage revelations in her interview with BBC’s Panorama still loom large. Meghan has often been compared to Harry’s mother because of her outspokenness and dislike of tradition. In a carefully choreographed interview during a royal tour of South Africa last October, Meghan told broadcaster Tom Bradby she was “existing, not living” under intense royal scrutiny, while Harry admitted he and his brother had “grown apart”.  When they announced they were quitting Britain in January, Bradby warned the couple could give a no-holds-barred interview, adding: “I don’t think it would be pretty.” Meghan may have written about her perceived rivalry with the Duchess of Cambridge, who allegedly fell out with the American when she shouted at her staff. And her own family problems are almost bound to be in her diaries – such as her devastation over dad Thomas not being at her wedding. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing extracts of a letter her estranged dad handed over to the newspaper. In it, she begged him to end his “painful attacks” on her “kind, patient” husband.  The strain first emerged when Thomas was exposed for staging paparazzi photos shortly before the wedding. From the moment she stepped into the Palace, Meghan rang alarm bells for staff. Sources have often claimed Meghan had no regard for stuffy royal protocol. The signs were subtle at first, from stepping out in public with bare legs to signing an autograph and showing Harry open displays of ­affection in public. At first, she seemed like the breath of fresh air the monarchy needed. But rumours emerged that “demanding” Meghan was sending staff am emails and caused her PA to quit in tears. Then came the wedding preparations furore. It’s said Meghan wanted air fresheners as th century St George’s Chapel smelled “musty” and that she was hurt when the Queen refused her first pick of a tiara from the royal collection.  All seemed forgotten the day they tied the knot. It was the fairytale ending the country wanted, but the magic was short-lived when her dad gave a TV interview claiming he had been shunned by his daughter. Meanwhile, as Meghan’s confidence grew, so did her disregard for The Establishment. After falling pregnant, she was determined to do things her own way, breaking a four-decade tradition of royals giving birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in London. The couple courted further controversy by refusing to reveal the names of baby Archie’s godparents. Then last Christmas they declined an invitation from the Queen to spend the festive season at Sandringham for a break in Canada. It was the beginning of the end.

The toll released in Mental Health Awareness week raises fresh questions over forces’ handling of conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. The “snapshot” showed  incidents in January alone. Official Ministry of Defence statistics disclose that the troops who sought help had attempted to hang themselves, overdose or slash their wrists with a kne. But military mental health support groups say the figure is the “tip of the iceberg” and warn that many of those self-harming could attempt suicide. The figures mean that over  military personnel could attempt suicide or self-harmthe number of incidents continue at the same rate for the next  months. So far this year at least five soldiers are feared to have killed themselves. Freedom of Information figures show that  soldiers, seven members of the Royal Navy and eight personnel serving in the RAF attempted suicide or injured themselves in January alone. Female troops are also more than twice as likely to self-harm than male colleagues, MoD figures show.  One soldier who self-harmed, who asked not to be identied, said it helped him cope with stress, a fear of failure and letting down his colleagues. He said: “I’ve been doing it on and off for five years. I cut myself and burnt my arm with an iron – that wayanyone asks I can say it was an accident. “I know it’s a mental health issue and I should get help but I’m concerned it will have an impact on my career. “I’m a lance corporal in the infantry and I’d effectively be blacklisted. I’m not the only one who feels like this. We had a suicide on the base last year and the message sent down the line was that the inidual was weak and a liability. Jeff Williams, of Veterans United Against Suicide, said: “It is very likely the situation is worse than the figures show given that many cases will never be identied. Many soldiers and veterans who self-harm later take their own lives. It’s a major problem.” Former Royal Marine Simon Maryan, of charity Icarus, said: “We’ve seen an increase in serving personnel from across all services getting in touch with Icarus for help. “They all say they are afraid to speak to superiors as they will have a black mark placed on their career. Others said they have been bullied and belittled while struggling with depression, anxiety etc as a result of service.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper home delivery offer","story":"NewsGet The Mirror delivered free to your door for six weeksIts packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByAlison PhillipsDaily Mirror Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  APR News\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But step through the front door and you would think youaposd stepped back in time. Built in the s, the red brick house is a typical three-bed semi - but the way itaposs built it the only thing thataposs typical about this property. Each room is a colourful wander back through the past and filled from top to bottom with s chic and glamour. From the Tiki-inspired Polynesian cocktail bar to the Youngstown-style kitchen and the stunnin living room to impressive bedrooms, no room has been forgotten. Emma Edwards and Nigel Preston worked tirelessly to transform their home in the fashionable neighbourhood in south Manchester into a vintage dream. And when they decided to sell up two years ago to move somewhere bigger, they opened their front door so people could get a glimpse at the s paradise. Colour fills every, single room from the floral wallpaper to the zebra print rug. Fancy a drink after a long day at work  Just head to the bamboo bar for a swt cocktail.Unusual pieces of art from  years ago fill the home, including the coupleaposs pride - a flamongo statue. And the renovation stretch beyond the house, with Emma even transforming her back garden into a s wonderland, complete with a beach-themed decked seating area with a pond. The pink wallpaper is vintage and the American-style kitchen has been recreated to perfection. Emma and Nigel have made sure all their furniture fits in with their s theme, from sofas, to dining tables and bookcases to beds.Emma explained: Most of what we have done is cosmetic apart from the s Hawaiian wallpaper in the living room, which we got from the States. It was £ a roll. “The kitchen is based on a Youngstown American s kitchen but the units are all modern made to look retro. I imported Chevron handles to give it that look. “The house has still got the s stained glass windows. It would be easy to turn this back into a s semithat’s what you wanted.” Emmaaposs passion for all things retro when she started collected vintage fabrics and furniture.She has now turned it into her business and runs an online shop, Miss Bamboo. But she warned that anyone  who wanted to create her stunning look that it has become increasingly dficult over the years. Emma told the Manchester Evening News: I have bought and sold a lot of stuff over the years but when I was younger you could get a lot more things in the flea markets and charity shops.  All that mid century stuff is gone now. I find things at specialist vintage events, on Etsy and on American Ebay. I know some specialist dealers as well. It’s about having the eye for this style. “I was a teenager of the s and there were a lot of youth subcultures then. Everybody was into something - there was rockabilly, punk, goth.

Professor Adrian Hill, whose team at Oxford University are racing to develop a jab, had originally hoped their efforts would be proved successful by September. But the researchers have suffered a setback because as coronavirus infections plummet in the UK, they cannot be sure their inoculation works, thereports. The Oxford vaccine is one of eight around the world and just one in the UK which is currently being tested in humans. Earlier in the year, scientists said they were % confident it would be proved effective by the autumn, making it one of the most promising candidates in the world. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here It is widely believed that a vaccine is the only long-term way to stamp out Covid- and allow lockdown measures to be fully lted. However,the virus is not spreading in the community, volunteers who have had the jab cannot catch it and scientists will not knowthey have immunity. More than , people - including over s and --year-olds - have been enrolled in the second phase of the trial. However, as the UK emerges from the peak of its coronavirus epidemic, Prof Hill says he now expects just  of these volunteers to catch it. If fewer than  test positive, the results will be of limited use.“We’re in the bizarre position of wanting Covid to stay, at least for a little while. But cases are declining, Prof Hill told the . Tipped to be a aposfront runnerapos in the fight against Covid-, the UK government has pinned their hopes on the Oxford project, and has already agreed to pay for up to  million doses. Business Secretary Alok Sharma has also suggested thatproved to work, half of the UK population could be given the vaccine by autumn. Earlier this week, pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca announced a .bn deal with the US government to produce an additional  million doses. The team is now looking to move its trials to coronavirus hotspots overseas, where the deadly bug is still spreading. “The US government, the UK government, loads of charities and philanthropists are all saying we’ll pay to have it manufactured, before you finish the trial. I mean, itaposs a huge kind of vote of confidence in what weaposre doing. Itaposs really flattering,” Prof Hill continued. “But that doesnapost guarantee the result.

Researchers in Singapore have used complex modelling to determine the exact date that the crisis can be declared over in countries around the world. Using data-driven estimates, they say that by September  the deadly bug will no longer be present in Britain, the Daily Star reports. This puts the UK ahead of the US, which will not be free of coronavirus until November . However, Italy and Singapore are set to stamp out the disease first, where the crisis is expected to recede by August  and July  respectively. Meanwhile, a leading professor at Oxford University has forecast that the UKaposs declining death rates could reach the stage of no fatalities being recorded on some days by the end of June. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Reaching zero cases means that the UK will be able to move to Level One in the Governmentaposs new coronavirus alert system, which would mean no social distancing measures are required. The UK is currently at stage four in the alert system, meaning there is high transmission of Covid-. However, the Singapore University of Technology innovation lab says the prediction is uncertain and can change with time. The date is also vulnerable to new surges of infections caused by easing lockdown measures and people breaching the rules. A spokesman for The Singapore University of Technology said: The model and data are inaccurate to the complex, evolving, and heterogeneous realities of dferent countries.Predictions are uncertain by nature. Readers must take any predictions with caution. Over-optimism based on some predicted end dates is dangerous because it may loosen our disciplines and controls and cause the turnaround of the virus and infection, and must be avoided. Separate modelling carried out in Washington and in Oxford has predicted that the UK could first see a -hour period with zero deaths from coronavirus by June. However, it is expected that there will be sporadic up and downs for several weeks afterwards. Professor Carl Heneghan, of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University told The Sun: I think by the end of June weaposll be looking at the data and finding it dficult to find people with this illness,the current trends continue in the deaths. But we will continue to have these sporadic up and downs for about four to six weeks. It comes after the number of Covid- patients to die in the UK rose today by  to ,, although that rise is far lower than the daily death tolls of over , recorded in April.

Mary Bousted, joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, insists parents should not send their children back to school until it is absolutely safe. She spoke out after the Government released evidence it used when creating its reopening timetable. It said the risk to pupils was “very small, but it is not zero”. She said the Government had “failed on every test” when it came to the way they had communicated with teachers.Ms Bousted added: “I can only think that’s happened because Boris Johnson and the Treasury, who I think are driving this, don’t understand schools.“They don’t understand how complex they are. They don’t understand the nature of children and social distancing.” She urged parents to weigh up the facts before sending their children back. And she told the Sunday Mirror: “If I was in that position, I’d be looking at the rate of infection in my region. Is it going up or down  “Then I’d look at the school’s plans. Is it going to be clean  Is there going to be social distancing  Will my child be safe and what will their learning experience be like  “Unless I could assure myself the science said it was safe and every precaution was being taken… no, my child wouldn’t be going back. “If those criteria were met I may consider it. If not, I wouldn’t.” More than , head teachers have signed an open letter to Gavin Williamson, urging the Education Secretary to reconsider.  His plan for a June  reopening would see some nursery children and others from Reception, Year One and Year Six go back. But with dozens of local authorities set to rebel and open schools later, pressure is on for a rethink.The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciessaid on Friday there were two conditions for schools to open – low levels of coronavirus in the community and a robust track and trace system.SAGE chairman Sir David King made clear the chances of those both being met by June  are “virtually nil”. Ms Bousted said a lack of clear Government guidance had left staff uncertain over rules around social distancing and PPE. She said: “One real concern is for teachers in special schools, where lots of children require intimate care and don’t understand social distancing. Staff should have masks, gowns and proper protective equipment as we know the virus is likely to transmit through bodily fluids. “We’ve been arguing that special schools must have good PPE in order to protect their staff.  “In other schools, the level of PPE will y because the science is changing all the time. But at the very least, schools needs to be thoroughly cleaned – and deeply “There must be hand sanitiser. And for those who want to wear masks, they should be available.” Ms Bousted gave Denmark as an example of a country where the government put measures in place for a safe reopening. And she compared it to the “completely inadequate” guidance here. She said: “They’ve made sure they have thought of everything. “In Denmark the government gave extra money for schools to have deep cleaning twice a day. If they have a tablet computer, it has to be wiped down between use. The toys have to be washed twice a day. “There’s a really intensive cleaning programme. In England, schools are cleaned one hour in the morning, an hour in the evening. “Where is the deep cleaning  This is absolutely crucial.  “Our schools have one sink for every  children. Where and how are we going to get children washing their hands  These practical things haven’t been thought through.” Ms Bousted hit back at reports that the issue was becoming political and insisted it was about safety. She added: “We want schools to reopen. We know how important education is. But health has to come first – children’s health, staff’s health and the community’s health.” Tory MP Tom Hunt accused unions of a “bizarre reverse class war”. He said: “From the heads I talk to, it’s the ones from poorer areas or with children at most need who are keenest to get back into class.” Teachersapos Views: aposI don’t see it is heroic for staff to be at riskapos Catherine Armistead, Skerton St Luke’s CE School, Lancaster - Head for seven years.  We are a one-form entry primary school with up to  pupils. All throughout we’ve been open for children of key workers and vulnerable children. The most children we’ve had in is  and social distancing has been challenging as they can’t help but gravitate together. I’ve got staff who really want to be in school but there are mixed messages from parents. Less than half are happy to send children back. A lot say they want their children tobecause they are under pressure to get back to work. Some parts of the media have this idea that it’s time for teachers to “step up and be heroes”. I don’t see how it’s heroic for my staff to be at risk. We’re having a training day on June  where we’ll decide with staff and governors what the way forward is. aposClasses re-opened as a babysitting serviceapos Chris Dyson, Parklands Primary School, Leeds - Head for six years.  Nobody wants everybody back in school more than me. When you walk down the corridors at the moment it’s a ghost town. But it has to be safe for the staff and for the children. As a headteacher,anything happened to my staff I would never recover from it. Everyone who is in the know is aware that June  is not going to happen. The R rate won’t be low enough. The Government are opening Reception, Year One and Year Six as a babysitting service just to get people out working. If they were serious they would be opening Year  and Year  because they have GCSEs and A-Levels. Look at the guidance – anyone who is in a supermarket should be in a facemask. But in schools, no masks needed. It doesn’t make sense. aposHow we were treated is insulting and scaryapos John Hayes, Gospel Oak Primary and Nursery School, North London - Head for eight years.  The staff have been phenomenal and it has been amazing to see them rise to this kind of challenge. The idea that this is about “going back to work” is insulting and demonstrates a total lack of understanding. We are desperate for the kids to be back here but the absolute responsibility of heads is to make sure that everyone is safe. And it’s really scary at the moment because we don’t have enough information. I’m frustrated by the lack of trust the Government has shown in us. They’ve totally failed to take us into their confidence. If they had spoken to us at the start of this and told us what they wanted to do – and why they wanted to do it – we could have helped them. We could have planned properly. Parentsapos Views - Will you send your children back  NO, it’s too dangerous for our boy Michelle Irwin, , from Hull, East Yorks, works in a children’s home and has a four-year-old son, Stanley, who is in Reception.  She said: “I think it’s too risky to send the kids back. It’s scary that adults and children can carry this virus without symptoms, and I’d worry about teachers getting it.“When they stopped school in March, Stanley was able to sit on the carpet with his friendsand hold their hands while they sang nursery rhymes, and that’s what school should be about. I don’t think he will understand the changes.”NO, my little girl is high-risk Former palliative care worker Laura Hawthorn, , from Stalham, Norfolk, has a five-year-old daughter, Amelia, who suffers from the rare kidney disease nephrotic syndrome, which puts her at greater risk of catching infections.

He hopes his four-year-old daughter Ruby willto nursery soon. He said: “Ruby needs interaction with other children – there’s only so much my we and I can teach her and she’s itching to see her friends and teachers face to face. “We strongly feel that the benefits of sending Ruby to school signicantly outweigh any risk. “And we don’t think we’re putting our health – or Ruby’s – in jeopardy.” YES, we’re happy with measures in place Stay-at-home mum Siobhan Patterson, from Rutland, East Mids, says she is going to send her five-year-old daughter Florence back to Year One classes and her two-year-old girl Olivia back to pre-school.  She said: “Where we live in Rutland has so few cases that we are comfortable to send our five-year-old daughter back. “We feel that the measures the school are putting in place will keep her as safe as possible. “I’ve enjoyed homeschooling, but I can’t replicate the school environment.” YES, but it’s a very personal choice Management consultant Claire Holt, , from Woking, Surrey, plans to send five-year-old son Rocky back to Reception and twins Axel and Hunter back to pre-school.

A chilly and blustery start to the weekend on Saturday is to make way for a warmer day today, with temperatures soaring still further to C on Monday. Many beaches across England stayed largely empty on Saturday as the weather helped keep people away amid warnings not to break coronavirus rules over the bank holiday weekend. Authorities feared crowds would flock to popular coastal destinations following similar incidents in the past week, but beauty spots in Brighton and Cornwall were quiet thanks to strong winds and rain showers. But the mercury is expected to rise to Cin London on Monday, with coastal areas likely to see the temperature hit C- and councils have warned people not to take advantage of the warmer weather. Saturday was predicted to be the colder day, before a pleasant Sunday, with warnings to the public remaining in place. Beach-goer, Jane Grfiths, retired, from Newquay, said her local area was more quiet on Saturday than usual for the time of year, as mph winds swept the area She said: A few people were dotted about and a few people were surfing. On normal May bank holidays, the beaches would have been packed and leguards would have had red flags flying today. Although breezy today, visitors would have used wind breaks.We saw a few people but nothing like the numbers we would normally have seen. Elsewhere in Brighton, the mercury rose to just Cin the morning, and as heavy showers arrived in the afternoon, pictures showed the seafront was largely empty. It was also a blustery day for other coastal areas in the South East, including Margate, in Kent, and Southend in Essex, which was busy earlier in the week. But Saturdayaposs gales and lower temperatures left beaches and open spaces empty for most of the day. In the North West, the usually popular Blackpool hit a maximum temperature of C , with some strong gales of up to mph. Pictures on social media showed an empty area surrounding the Blackpool Tower tourist attraction on the seafront. But the warnings from councils to stay away remain the same ahead of sunny spells expected to arrive for parts of the UK on Sunday.  Sefton Council in Merseyside has adopted a new campaign ahead of the bank holiday weekend, telling people Wish you werenapost here!. In Cornwall, council leaders have warned there is no leguard cover and a large coastal swell and spring tide will bring hazardous sea conditions over the weekend. Devon County Council asked people to think twice about visiting the coast and to considerthey could remain closer to home.

The Coastguard and the RNLI fear for the public’s safety with fewer beaches being monitored during the pandemic and no leguards on duty. They told the Mirror they have seen ato near-normal numbers visiting beaches after the lockdown was eased. Now they fear thousands more will flock to the coast this weekend as the sunny weather is set to , with temperatures of Cin the South. Brits must also continue to observe social distancing and stay two metres away from people outside their household, which may prove dficult on packed beaches. The Coastguard and RNLI have launched a beach safety campaign and are urging parents to leave their “giant unicorn and pink flamingo” inflatables at home. Falmouth Coastguard James Instance said: “What we are seeing is ato what we would expect to be normal levels of activity. “It’s gone from a stop to full-speed ahead – there are people kayaking, surfing. There have been no baby steps at all. We need people to take responsibility for themselves.” Mark Dowie, of the RNLI, said they would normally have  beaches monitored, but it is currently just . He said: “No children are at school, many adults are not working or have been furloughed. So it’s of course natural for people to want to take their children to the beach. But, for goodness sake, keep an eye on your kids.”  Police are also concerned about virus spread and have urged people to stay away from the Peak District until later in the year. And in Brighton, the council is restricting access to the beach. This week also saw large crowds on beaches in Southend, Essex. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said on Friday: “All of the anecdotal evidence suggests that the vast majority of the public are still following the rules. “And by doing so are helping to save lives and we thank them for that. “We recognise the sacrices which the public are making but as we head into the long weekend we must all renew our efforts and continue to abide by the social distancing rules.” Meteorologist Simon Partridge, from the Met Office, predicted the best of the sun will arrive on bank holiday Monday. He said: “On Monday, the high pressure extends further, bringing with it plenty of fine, dry, sunny, weather across the UK with some light winds. Temperatures in South East could be C.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice people dominic cummingss departure","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the People: Dominic Cummingss departure is long overdueThe Prime Ministers aide has shown a disdain for the guidance he himself put in place, and contempt for anyone who questions his actionsShareCommentsBySunday People:,  MAY NewsopinionHe travelled more than  miles in a car with his we Mary despite lockdown restrictions \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

There can never be one rule for a powerful elite and another for the rest of us. By travelling with his family from their London home to his parents’ farm in Durham during lockdown, the Prime Minister’s closest and most influential adviser has undermined that. While millions of families made sacrices in isolation, denying themselves contact with loved ones in desperate times, Cummings decided it was acceptable for him to ignore his Government’s own guidelines. He claims it was reasonable, legal and in the best interests of his young son. The public will be sympathetic but sceptical. Whether or not it was technically within the limits of the law, as Cummings says in his defence, is not as important as the message that the revelation sends to the rest of us – who obeyed the rules for the benefit of all. That he and Downing Street attempted to keep the trip a secret shows that he and Boris Johnson knew his behaviour was unacceptable.  His defence is shallow. Dominic Cummings has cast a dark shadow over the way this Government works. His influence, not least over the coronavirus, has been questionable. Now he has been shown to have disdain not just for the conventions of public conduct, but for the rest of society. His time in Downing Street has been short but his departure is long overdue."},{"url":null,"title":"woman boyfriend 30 years older","story":"NewsWoman with boyfriend  years older explains why hes better than any man her ageSammy Mcgilligan, , says she was drawn to partner Ricky, , due to his calm maturity and warmth - but the relationship has caused problems with her familyShareCommentsByMarcello Mega:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe couple have had to battle for approval over the years \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Sammy Mcgilligan, , says partner Ricky, , is better than any man her own age and she felt drawn to his calm maturity as well as his warmth. But the couple have had to battle for approval over the years - with Sammyaposs mum refusing to meet Ricky until nearly a year into their reltionship. When she told her mum she was dating a man  years her senior, it drove a wedge between them. They were always close up to that point but mother-of-seven Shona refused to meet Ricky, who is just three months younger than her, until the relationship was approaching its one-year anniversary, reports the Daily Record. Seven years on, the couple have four children, are thinking about having one more and plan to marry in , the year before she turns  and he turns . While celebrities with much younger partners can’t be certain that a massive part of the attraction isn’t linked to wealth or fame, for ordinary people like Sammy and Ricky, , it seems to be all about love. Sammy, , from Perth, said: “We met on February , , at a mutual friend’s house when there was a party. “I had recently broken up with a partner due to domestic abuse. I met Ricky and thought he was nice looking, sweet and funny. “We spoke, had a laugh and a chat, and while leaving the party we exchanged phone numbers. “We messaged and called every day without fail, though at first we didn’t want anybody to find out about our new relationship, mainly because of our ages. “We guessed what people would think, so we were meeting up secretly and going for walks daily. “Our secret came out on April , , at Ricky’s th birthday party. We didn’t mean it to get out then, but once it was in the open we made it official.” She told her mum about the new man in her le but she didn’t want to know.  Sammy said: “She said he was too old for me and that it wouldn’t last. “I told her she was wrong, that he was really nice and she should meet him before she judged him. But for quite a while she said she couldn’t accept him. “To be honest, it wasn’t always easy. We did have a rocky spell after about eight months when some dferences were getting between us. “But around that time we found out I was pregnant with our first baby – and by putting all our energies into planning to become a family, we got back on track and have never really looked back. “Even my mum started to come round.” Ricky’s first step towards acceptance was being invited to Sammy’s mum’s house on Boxing Day  – some  months after they started going out. Sammy said: “Mum could see he was treating me right, was supportive and not abusive in any way.  “In February this year, we celebrated seven years together and our le together has been pretty non-stop. “We love kids and wanted to have a big family, so now we have Declan, who is five, Robert, who is four, and Matthew, now aged three. We had a loss in , which was heartbreaking, but then Myleigh, our rainbow baby, came along to cheer us all up, and she’s now  months.” While the couple have committed to each other by raising a family, wedding bells have had to be put on hold because they’ve been so busy with the children.

Scott Waring, who runs a YouTube channel and website called ET Data Base, says the peculiar shape is located on a apossmall and uninhabited island in Indonesiaapos.He says he believes it to be a doorway to an aposunderground alien baseapos, as it doesnapost fit in with its environment and is in a secluded location where aposaliens would love to have a hidden baseapos. Using a tool on Google Earth, he measured the opening to find it was  metres across, which he says is big enough to aposget a lot of alien ships in thereapos. You can check it out for yourself on Google Earth by searching the coordinates: °apos.S °apos.E. Writing about the discovery on his website, Scott says: I found an entrance to an underground base on a secluded island in Indonesia. The doorway can easily be seen with Google Earth map and when you add contrast to a screenshot the detail really comes out.We can even tell from looking at it that the UFO that flew through this doorway was leaving the underground base. How do we know this  Because the deeper insides of the tunnel are collapsed and closed in, but the outer surfaces area is still open. This is the perfect place for an underground base on such a secluded island where few people ever wander. In a video posted on YouTube, Scott inspects the image further, saying: That is just amazing to me, that is totally unnatural. That is an alien entrance to an underground base people. He argues the formation of the opening proves the UFO was leaving the base to go aposto the skyapos.  Others praised Scott for the find, with one writing: I think this is entrance specically for the interstellar ships. It is well known that Reptiloidsuse cigar-shaped ships or cylindrical shaped ships. And now. Look at the shape of the entrance! Itaposs clearly for their ships!

The North Korean leader was rumoured to be gravely ill or even dead last month after he missed an important anniversary event. But he reappeared at a fertiliser factory, and has now been pictured chairing a meeting about the countryaposs nuclear capabilities. The meeting of the ruling Workersapos Partyaposs powerful Central Military Commission marked Kimaposs first public appearance in three weeks The military meeting to discuss new policies to bolster the countryaposs nuclear capabilities amid stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States, state media KCNA said on Sunday. He made an unusually small number of outings in the past two months amid coronavirus concerns. North Korea has imposed strict anti-coronavirus measures although it says it has no confirmed cases.  And pictures from the event appear to show those at the meeting sitting relatively close together - not two metres apart under social distancing guidelines widely adopted where in the world. Speculation had erupted about Kimaposs wellbeing after the despot missed an annual birthday celebration for his late grandfather - Kim Il-sung, the countryaposs founder - on April . Taiwanaposs National Security Bureaudirector-general Chiu Kuo-cheng reporting last week the leader was sick and contingency plans were in placehe were to die.US-led negotiations aimed at dismantling North Koreaaposs nuclear and missile programmes have made little progress since late last year, especially after a global battle on coronavirus began. The meeting discussed measures to bolster armed forces and reliably contain the persistent big or small military threats from the hostile forces, KCNA said.

Jackie Burrows, , from Brisbane, Australia, has gone from st and a size  to now weighing .st and a svelte size  . She has hailed Aldiaposs meal replacement shakes as her secret weapon behind her dramatic transformation over the course of  months. She initially replaced her breakfast with the  calorie drinks - which come in flavours vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and coffee - before eventually having them for dinner too. And now she has shared amazing before and after weight loss transformation photos. Taking to the Aldi MumsFacebook page, an inspirational Jackie vowed: I am not going back to the way I was. I am not that fat person anymore. Jackie previously shared her amazing weight loss journey in October, and in an update this week told how she has managed to maintain her new body with healthy eating and has even lost another stone. She said she is now just drinking the meal replacement shakes for breakfast, while her other meals consist of salad, chicken or fish. She has also cut out carbs, dairy, red meat, coffee, alcohol and junk food from her diet too.  She explained: Motivation is the key and the want to do something about it - I have yo yo dieted all my le. I started the shakes on January, th . I had one for breakfast and one for dinner. It was hard when I started, mainly for the first week, until my body got use to less calories being consumed. I made salads - mixed lettuce leaves, capiscum, carrot, cucumber, tomatoes, olives, jalapenos with either chicken or fish.  I have green tea, water, red grapes, popcorn no butter, uncrystallised ginger, dates and almonds. Jackie says she also did an hour of exercise each day for  months. I now do an hour five days a week of treadmill exercise and have the weekend off, she said. I made a lestyle change, I never looked at it as a diet - it is what I needed to do.  I purchased clothes which were smaller and made myself get into them. You have to want it bad and I did. Now I can buy any clothes I want. I am not that fat person anymore - I was happy but now I am happier. Jackie says she originally piled on the pounds after having four children - leaving her no time to look after herself. My first children were twin girls, and I put on kg with them in , she said.  Then I had my son in , then another daughter in . Over this time I put my children first at all times, leaving no time for me. When she hit kg and a size , the mum decided to make a change. She heard about a friend losing more than five stone through shakes and decided to give it a go. She said: I had never tried diet shakes or program weight loss. I didnapost want to get fixed into weight loss programs and I didnapost want to be noticed as a failure.  After replacing her breakfast with a shake she soon started to see results which gave her the motivation to keep going. She added: I often put one [sachet] in my drink cup shaker and put in my handbag so I donapost make bad choices when I am out. Getting active was the hardest part. I was the laziest person. The Australian says she has never felt happier and is confident she will keep the weight off. Thanking everyone for their support, Jackie added that her weight loss was being monitored by a doctor. Jackie’s post received huge support from the group’s members, who congratulated her on her weight loss. “My god Jackie, you are an inspiration, looking fantastic and younger as well!” said one.

It was great.“I remember being in Dens and just crossing the street and after one minute we were at the Dundee United stadium. That was the most strange thing.“I have played in a lot of derbies, Boca Juniors-River Plate, after that Rangers-Celtic, I played against Lazio when I was at Roma so I can say I have played great games with two teams who hate each other. It was great for the people.“I knew the fans would feel it a lot to win against United. I know the feeling of winning a derby.“With my team-mates we celebrated with the fans and it was great. I had won derbies in my career and that was another one – I wanted to win that game because I knew how signicant it is for the fans.”He added: “It was a great experience, one I liked a lot and I’m not just saying that. I liked my time a lot in Scotland.“I didn’t know anything about Dundee when Bonetti called me but I said ‘let’s go and don’t think about that’. The people were great.“I remember the first game against Aberdeen, coming on in the second half. I was kicked by a defender who got a red card – I had to jump otherwise he would have broken my legs!“I liked the way of playing football in Scotland, I liked the dynamic of the game.“You could never say you had won a gameyou were winning - with five minutes to go. In Italy, you are winning - or - and no one wants to go forward so I liked that a lot.”Caniggia’s ability and manner on the pitch quickly endeared him to the Dundee support with many sporting long, blonde wigs as a tribute.“I remember the guys with the wigs, it was very funny. I like the people in Scotland a lot, very funny, easy going people and with a lot of pride.“Dens was a small stadium but I liked it a lot and the people at the club were great.“We had good players. I remember Gavin Rae, Barry Smith, Georgi Nemsadze – we had a few good players. We could match the big teams.”At the end of the first season, however, Caniggia would move on to Rangers as he chased a place at the  World Cup.Caniggia explained: “I was already -years-old but I was very fit. I enjoyed a lot being at Dundee but I was thinking about going to the national team.“I knew I would be  by the time the World Cup, and I knew it would be very dficult but I had to go to the biggest team to maybe have a chance.“I repeat, I enjoyed a lot playing for Dundee and I love the people there.“I decided to go, Rangers came to me and I spoke to the coach and I said ‘let me go’ because I wanted to go to the World Cup with Argentina.“They let me go and it was great, I came back to the national team for the World Cup.”Playing with World Cup star Claudio Caniggia was #surreal#, says ex-Dee Willie Falconer\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp playing-with-world-cup-star-claudio-caniggia-was-surreal-says-ex-dee-willie-falconer embed # secretoWEPSGDAW\" data-secret\"oWEPSGDAW\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/pressandjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/46534011-848x564.jpg ","title":"people must use own judgement when travelling to see loved ones beyond their own area","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has said people can travel beyond their local area to visit family from next week but must use their judgement on whether it is safe to do so.Looking ahead to the the easing of lockdown restrictions from Thursday, the first minister emphasised that people must stay outside when visiting and warned going to the bathroom could spread the coronavirus.Ms Sturgeon said the distance to be travelled and the risk of needing the loo should be factored into decisions about calling on relatives.Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s official guidance recommending that people should stay within five miles of their home for leisure and exercise would not apply to family visits.She also claried that the guidance does not limit families to restricting their meetings to just one other household.“You can see dferent households, but we are asking you only to meet one at a time,” Ms Sturgeon said.With the Bank Holiday weekend under way, the first minister urged the public to “stick with” the Stay at Home message, reminding them that the lockdown will not be eased until Thursday.Ms Sturgeon warned that “taking the foot off the break” over the weekend could jeopardise chances of restrictions being relaxed next week.We are not intending to put a five-mile limit on the distance you can travel to, for example, sit with your parents in their garden, but we are asking you to use judgement.#First Minister Nicola SturgeonAt her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon sought to answer some questions that have been raised since the publication of the Scottish Government’s route map out of lockdown earlier this week.The first minister also announced a further  deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus in the last  hours taking the total, under that measurement, to ,.A total of , cases had been confirmed in Scotland, an increase of  from the day before and a total of , patients were in hospital with the virus.The Scottish Government’s lockdown exiting strategy will result in the introduction of the first of four gradual phases next Thursday.After that date people will be allowed to meet up with other households, as long it is one at a time outdoors while observing physical distancing.Golf, bowls, tennis, fishing, hiking and canoeing will be allowed and outdoor work such as forestry and agriculture will resume.The -page document, detailing the strategy, also contained the five-mile recommendation.But Ms Sturgeon said: “We are not intending to put a five-mile limit on the distance you can travel to, for example, sit with your parents in their garden,” Ms Sturgeon said. “But we are asking you to use judgement.“If, for example, you travel a long distance to see a relative outside, you’ll be more likely to go inside the house to use the bathroom.“We don’t want you to go inside others’ houses in this phase becauseyou are infectious, maybe without knowing it, you risk leaving the virus on surfaces inside the house and that would pose a risk to other people, particularlyyou’re visiting elderly relatives – that is a risk we don’t want you to take.”It is about sayingyour parents live in Inverness and your parents live in Glasgow then what it will require for you to practically visit them might be putting your parents at risk. Therefore, don’t do it for those reasons.”Nicola SturgeonMs Sturgeon added that she was “desperate” to see her own parents, but the “last thing” she wanted to do was put them at risk.“I’m desperate to see my parents, like everybody , but the last thing I want to do – and I know others feel the same here – is put my parents at risk by inadvertently potentially passing them the virus,# she said.The first minister was confident people would exercise good judgement.  “It’s not me sayingyour parents live in Inverness don’t go because I’m telling you not to go,” she said. “It is about sayingyour parents live in Inverness and your parents live in Glasgow then what it will require for you to practically visit them might be putting your parents at risk. Therefore, don’t do it for those reasons.”As Scotland gradually comes out of the lockdown, Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said police would not be stopping motorists to ask them where they were going to ensure they were abiding by the rules. Chief Constable Livingstone said road checks would be counterproductive and intrusive.Ms Sturgeon also said Scotland could need more than the , contact tracers being recruited to implement her test, trace and isolate strategy.She said the Scottish Government is “on track” to have , contact tracers in place by June. She added that Scotland was “very close” to being able to process , tests for Covid- a day.But Ms Sturgeon conceded more testing and tracers may be required, depending on “the requirements the virus places on us”.The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.31649022-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.31649022-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.31649022-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.31649022-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"rakish bingham dundee united release","story":"Rakish Bingham has spoken of his #surprise# over his Dundee United departure but vowed to bounce back.Bingham had impressed after joining the Tangerines on a short-term deal back in February as he chased of a longer contract to fulfil his dream of starring in the Premiership next season.Yet the -year-old former Wigan, Falkirk and Doncaster winger had his hopes dashed when he was recently released by the newly-promoted Premiership outfit as they prepare for their much-anticipatedto the top-flight.Bingham said: #I was a bit surprised to be honest.#I thought I#d done quite well and the feeling I had wasn#t that I was going to be let go.#I can#t speak for the club with everything that#s going on in terms of budget, and that#s obviously part of the reason this has happened.#But I just have to take it on the chin and see what#s out there for the next step in my career.#Bingham savoured his time on Tayside with Robbie Neilson#s men and hopes they can hold their own in the top tier of Scottish Football next season.He added: #It was good at United.

Outdoor areas will be utilised more frequently.Laurence Findlay, Aberdeenshire Council#s director of education and children#s services, said in a letter to parents: #It is clear that we will all have to continue to be flexible about learning arrangements for the foreseeable future.#While the number of in-school hours possible from August may not be what you are hoping for, I am sure you will appreciate safety must come first and employers are expected to support parents as far as possible.#He added: #In very challenging circumstances, schools have adapted very well to providing home and online learning, and young people and parents have responded to this really well.#I am in no doubt that we will overcome the challenges ahead and I would like to thank staff across Aberdeenshire for their efforts.#I would also like to thank all parents carers for your continued support and I hope you and your families are all keeping well at this dficult time.#The news came as First Minister revealed grandparents who perform childcare duties would not be allowed to do so # even after childminding services are allowed to restart.Nicola Sturgeon has said “one of the most distressing” aspects of lockdown is the need to keep families apart, as it was revealed some grandparents may be unable see their grandchildren for “many months”.The Scottish Government’s “route map” out of lockdown # published on Thursday # sets out how childcare provision will be fully reopened as the country enters its third phase of easing restrictions, likely some time in August.But the document makes no reference to families who rely on grandparents for childcare and appears to suggest a requirement for family members in other households to maintain a two-metre distance may not be lted until phase four.It means the fourth phase, which the plan describes as “many months” away, could be the first time grandparents of very young children are able to visit them in person.The timeframe may also apply to when older family members are able to share an embrace for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak began.The first minister was asked at her daily briefing in Edinburgh what she would say to the grandparents of young children for whom physical distancing is unlikely to possible for the duration of the lockdown measures.#There are so many dficult aspects of this, too many to list, but one of the most distressing aspects # and I’ve seen the impact of that in my own parents # is not being able to be with grandchildren.”Ms Sturgeon said the requirement had taken a toll in her own family and she admitted it is a situation that “really upsets” her.She said: “There are so many dficult aspects of this, too many to list, but one of the most distressing aspects # and I’ve seen the impact of that in my own parents # is not being able to be with grandchildren.“I don’t want that to continue for any longer than possible and we will try to run through these phases as quickly as we can, as quickly as the evidence allows.“But I come back to the central point here # older people are most at risk from this virus % of people who have died in Scotland of this virus have been over-. That, I’m afraid, is just the brutal fact at the heart of this.”The first minister stressed that asking adults and children not to be together in some cases, no matter how dficult, “is about protecting the grandparent# and to make sure you’re around longer to see your grandchildren grow up.”“I know this is dficult,” she said. “You will be able, once we lt some of these restrictions and go into the next phase, to sit in the garden with your grandkids again but at a two-metres distance for this next phase.“I know how practically dficult that will be # particularly with young children # but it is for your protection and we won’t ask you to continue to restrict your normal le for any longer than we feel is necessary.

There are no other comparable facilities in the vicinity. The neighbouring uses include a burger restaurant and a fried chicken restaurant but these are considered a completely dferent offer.#The site is too small to be viable for employment uses.  It is the second half of a previously-used semi-retail car showroom development. The first half of the site was approved for a KFC restaurant and drive-thru in November  and is now built, but is not yet operational. The site has been marketed with no interest for business use.#The local road network has been improved to cater for this proposed development and the Council’s Roads officers consider those improvements acceptable. It is located at the edge of the Bridge of Don Industrial Park and will provide new sit-in and takeaway coffee and sandwich provision that will support existing businesses and help promote the take-up of the remaining vacant land in the neighbouring industrial park.#A reasonable spread of such facilities in Aberdeen offer those seeking coffee sandwiches an opportunity to access those without the need to travel extensively.  They operate more like a locally convenience facility than a destination.#We would also like to point out that the applicant, Kemble Estates, has made a signicant investment in this site over the past  years, and has recently invested signicantly in traffic improvements to improve the Ellon Road Broadfold Road junction.  This involved purchasing land from Aberdeen City Council to widen the junction.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.31649022-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.31649022-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.31649022-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.31649022-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"popular north east farm opens up kitchen to deliver baked goods","story":"A popular farm, known for its Highland cows, has opened up its kitchens to deliver sweet treats across the north-east.Aikenshill Farm, situated six miles north of Aberdeen, is home to a fold of Scottish cattle, a bed and breakfast, and most recently, Aikenshill Scullery.The farm, owned by James Duthie and his family, started the new food venture amid the coronavirus lockdown.His daughters Sara and Jess created an Instagram to show off their baking and after receiving encouragement from the public, decided to sell their goodsSara said: “It’s kind of all come about because me and my sister we really enjoy cooking and baking and we made a wee Instagram page when we started just to share what we made from home.“We didn’t think anything of it, we’ll just make it and once the coronavirusfinishes it’ll just kind of die away.“But we do lots of baking for the guys who come and work on the farm and the staff and they were posting it and a lot of people were posting it and we were getting private messages saying ‘Hey girls, wonderingyou’re interested in selling this.’”The encouragement led the family to give selling their treats a go.Sara said: “Our kitchen is certied for cooking food for the public in things, because the house gets used as a bed and breakfast. I’ve got all my food health and hygiene certicates, so does my mum and my sister because they’re been to cookery school and we thought ‘och we’ll give it a try’.“We’ll see how it goes the first week and we’ll take it from there.

It brings a smile to my face that a little biscuit can cheer you up during this time, and we always put a wee note, just to say enjoy, or we’ll write a note from their friend to them and it has really just all of a sudden taken off out of nowhere.“I’ll be honest we didn’t expect it to go this way, but then again as a new business you don’t really know what way it’s going to go –it’s going to work,it’s not going to work.“We deliver two days a week, on a Wednesday and a Thursday, and on a Wednesday we do Aberdeen and west and then on a Thursday we do north.

Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings. They had a good day and brought the car home in th overall and eighth in a competitive Class . They plan to do the full season, so watch this space for updates on their progress.The closely contested event was finally won by Michael Binnie and Clare Mole in a Mitsubishi Evo, with the ever present Jock Armstrong and Cameron Fair taking second place in the TEG Sport Impreza, after leading the rally for much of the day.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on the what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey through to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves area favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, threadlike leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, then you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general wellbeing is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.

two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music.

When a montage of Nigelrsquos le ndash which had clearly been a wonderfully happy one ndash was played at the end, I found myself choking back the tears.And Iwasnrsquot the only one, as the extraordinary outpouring of grief for Nigel has highlighted. Don spoke movingly of the ldquoNigel-shaped hole that now exists in his le, and it is testament to this particularly good boy that so many viewers also felt such acute loss at his passing.At a deeper level the reaction also relates to the terrible and frightening times we are living through, while speaking to the ability dogs have to comfort and heal human beings ndash even through a television set.:Garry Scott: Its a dogs le under lockdownldquoPure is the word Don used to describe Nigel, and many of us will recognise and cling to this quality in our canine companions as the coronavirus wreaks misery and chaos all around. Dogs face each day with the same enthusiasm, find the same unbridled joy in every single throw of the ball and rub of the belly. Who doesnrsquot envy a dogrsquos ability to live purely and fully in the moment, even this uniquely awful, scary one They are also natural comedians, of course, and at this point I must give special mention to BBC Sport commentator Andrew Cotterrsquos viral videos featuring his labradors Mabel and Olive. All three surely deserve awards ndash and maybe a letimersquos supply of Bonios ndash for their service to the nation during the pandemic.The unconditional love given freely by dogs, and their unembarrassed reliance upon our reciprocation, is quite overwhelming in its purity. It can be a lesaver, too. Don has talked publicly about his struggles with depression over the years, reiterating how his dogs helped him through the darkest times. Many reading this now will be able to relate. Even those who have never suffered from clinical depression may find themselves struggling to negotiate the loneliness of lockdown. At the most fundamental level dogs give us something to live for, something to get out of bed for. They love us evenwe donrsquot love ourselves. They heal us gladly, unknowingly, just by being themselves.And thatrsquos medical fact. Scientic studies show how dogs reduce stress, depression, loneliness and anxiety. They make us healthier, physically and mentally, by encouraging us to take exercise and socialise. People with dogs have lower blood pressure and are less likely to develop heart disease than others. Just playing with a dog releases enough dopamine to give you an instant high.Irsquove come to rely on this dopamine fix.

Taking Sam and Morag to chase balls in the park has saved my mental health during lockdown I honestly donrsquot know how Irsquod have coped without their infectious, undying enthusiasmthese last few weeks.During the worst of times it is natural that we yearn for and search out innocence, purity and goodness. Animals innately possess and exude these qualities. They anchor us to a better world. They remind us that a better world exists. And they encourage us to find even a small amount of happiness in every moment, regardless of how bleak it seems.:Susan Swarbrick: How dogs are enriching our lives more than everAs humanity tries to find a way through the coronavirus our ability to understand its signicance is both a blessing and a misfortune. With this in mind, I canrsquot help thinking the tears I cried for a TV dog I have never met perhaps represented a deeper grief for the loss of innocence the crisis has forced upon us all.In the meantime, rest in peace dear Nigel.

A shop assistant was palpably distressed as she told me she couldnrsquot go with her pregnant daughter for her scan, or see the twins she usually collects twice a week from school. One of my friends had booked to fly to Australia to be with her daughter when her baby ndash the first grandchild ndash arrived. Instead, she is stranded thousands of miles away, anxiously watching the calendar, and knitting, knitting, knitting.Itrsquos no surprise that the likes of Zoom and Facetime have become emotional le-rafts, with everyone rushing to climb aboard. Earlier this week, my sister was making granola with an eight-year-old, an hourrsquos drive away in Glasgow. With four of her grandsons in one household, portal sessions can be chaotic. The two-year-old usually makes an appearance only at the bottom of the screen, detected by a tuft of blond hair moving at speed beyond reach.If you could see the profiles of those using this technology, yoursquod find it flooded with retirees, desperate for a glimpse of their families and their youngest. It might be a poor substitute for a hug, but most would agree that online chats are better than nothing. Children grow so swtly, time-lapse photography would make you giddy. They shoot up faster than Leylandii, and learn new words every day. My great-nephewrsquos favourite just now is ldquodisgusting. He applies this to his motherrsquos cooking.Half the older population is probably, like me, filling their devices with adorable pictures, and frantically upgrading their cloud storage to contain it all. It makes me wonder, did my grandparents delight in photos of my siblings and me  Irsquoll never know. Thinking of them is like going back to another place and time ndash which is where, as Edwardian Londoners, they came from. When I was a girl, most folk were considered decrepit at . And often they were, worn out from work and hardship. Reaching retirement was the time for pipe and slippers rather than bungee jumping or skying. The grandchildren who visited once a week, or month, or at Christmas, were patted on the head, spoken to in a loud voice, and indulged with sweets. When it was time to leave, there was rarely any protest.I used to envy school friends whose aged relatives were closely involved with their lives. Today, that closeness is taken for granted, as the older folks work a rota, caring for youngsters after school or during holidays, while their parents work.It is one of the loveliest rapports to observe. In a culture that puts a lot of pressure on the young, to do well at school or university, to look good and be popular, the advice and companionship of those who have seen it all, and take a relaxed view, is invaluable. Therersquos much hand-wringing about the state of modern society, with fractured or dysal families causing heartache and instability. Not much is said, however, of the role grandparents play in holding things together and nurturing those on the first and most precarious rungs of le.Adjectives that can be applied to most working mothers and fathers include irritable, harassed and exhausted. Those over , especially once their careers have ended, have shot those rapids and are in calmer waters. Grandchildren instinctively recognise that theyrsquoll find in them a champion who puts them first, whether itrsquos as a bulwark against strict rules and nagging, or simply someone who isnrsquot always watching the clock. Time and patience are the most important gt a grandparent has to give: to play, read, go for a walk, watch a film, or take a child to football practice and roar encouragement from the sidelines. It doesnrsquot really matter what they actually do together, simply having someonersquos attention for a few hours is priceless. And for granddads especially, I suspect, itrsquos a chance to offer something they had in too short supply when they were raising their own brood.In terms of the family machine, therersquos never been a time when this ageing cohort has been more crucial to its smooth running. With most parents working within a year or two of a childrsquos birth, the period when offspring need to be collected from nursery, or be cared for after school or out of term-time, has signicantly expanded. Only recently have economists begun to calculate the worth of this unpaid army of nannies, chauffeurs, shuttlers, carers, cooks, cleaners and counsellors.It wonrsquot surprise anyone who falls into this group to learn that the hidden price of childcare on the national balance sheet is huge. One analysis in  estimated that, on average, such help annually saves a family pound. Thatrsquos pound billion across the UK. Few grandparents would ever see their contribution in pounds and pence, even those who are far from well-off themselves. Yet it is implicitly understood that without their help, countless thousands of households would struggle to hold down their jobs and make ends meet.The ongoing effect of Covid  on contact between generations could be profound. As the world s to work, many grandparents will be obliged to watch on, from relative isolation, for who knows how much longer But for most who are in this predicament, itrsquos not the maths thatrsquos worrying them. It is the absence of physical contact: fingers sticky with chocolate, displays of cartwheels and bunny jumps, revision schedules more complicated than a ScotRail timetable. And it is a two-way loss, children missing out as much as they do. The loving web that binds young and old is usually invisible, and passes largely unnoticed. Yet, as wersquoll soon see, itrsquos a crucial network that keeps the country running.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions. They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald"},{"url":null,"title":"keith-bruce-life-legacy-classical-music-heavyweight-michael-tumelty","story":"That meant being in amongst the grass-roots of music in Scotland in a way that few specialist writers in his field had been before. Read the work of his predecessors in The Herald, with its long tradition of taking the arts seriously as a matter for its news pages, earlier unidentied under a generic ldquoOur Music Critic byline, and a tone of aloof commentary is more often the order of the day.When Arnold Kemp appointed Michael to succeed Malcolm Rayment as The Heraldrsquos classical music man in , it was with a brief to reflect the animated discussions the editor had overheard ndash and doubtless added volubly to ndash in Glasgowrsquos City Halls and Edinburghrsquos Usher Hall during the interval and at the end of concerts. Tumeltyrsquos brief was to bring some passion to the role, as well as the expertise of a chap with an honours degree in music from Aberdeen University.That commitment and vitality his writing delivered in spades, but quickly self-learned, or absorbed from those with whom he worked in his new job at The Heraldrsquos Albion Street headquarters, was the attitude of a newspaper man.That meant being first to the story, in a field where it was not always immediately obvious what the story was. In reviewing concerts, the task was straightforward, an on-the-night deadline that meant a precise number of words delivered shortly after the music finished to catch the appropriate edition of the paper. Having consumed his words as a Herald reader, my first job in Albion Street included catching and sub-editing those words into the waiting space on a page. When a number of crits were due, Michaelrsquos iniably arrived first and in need of the least attention.But also being first to identy the new talent emerging in Scotland, or to track subtle shts in the tastes of the listening, and ticket-buying, audience, and to hear the fractures as well as the growing intimacy in an orchestrarsquos relationship with a conductor, required very big ears indeed. Michael had those.In his final years of poor health, which he bore with astonishing equanimity and resilience, I was constantlysupplying his phone number and news of his well-being to musicians of all ages, men and women of international standing and those of local community commitment across the country.Informed by the background in teaching that has preceded his journalistic career, Michael was not just a sharp-eared talent-spotter but also an attentive mentor. Young talents who were going through a crisis of confidence, or were finding the opportunities presented to them overwhelming, opened up to him and turned to him for advice.Although he would never break a confidence, that meant that The Herald often had the most revealing interviews, detailing the growth of a young artistrsquos development, as well as their first recital reviews. Conductor Garry Walker, now music director at Opera North, pianist Steven Osborne, and recent multi-award-winning guitarist Sean Shibe are just three who acknowledge the debt they owe to Michaelrsquos early support. When the Herald Angel awards began at the Edinburgh Festivals in  ndash uniquely among prizes at the annual jamboree embracing the ldquoofficial event as well as the Fringe ndash Michael was out of the blocks like a whippet to make sure that classical music was in the mix. Her debut Festival recital saw Aberdonian soprano Lisa Milne taking her place alongside young actors Emily Watson and Shirley Henderson among the earliest Angel winners.Read more: a classic Michael Tumelty reviewOur national music companies ndash Scottish Opera, the RSNO and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra ndash display trophies they were awarded as a result of Michaelrsquos advocacy. His international reach included a swt appreciation of Ivan Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra on their first residency in Edinburgh in , and Angels, Archangels and Little Devils given to an impressive list of distinguished visiting conductors and ensembles.That enthusiasm produced some memorable encounters, including the presentation of an Archangel to Australian Sir Charles Mackerras by playwright Willy Russell, after which Michael could be seen surreptitiously smuggling glasses of celebratory fizz to the conductor while the watchful eye of Lady Mackerras was distracted in another direction.It is a great loss to this yearrsquos celebrations of the th anniversary of the birth of Beethoven that Michael was no longer able to contribute his knowledge of, and enthusiasm for, his mighty legacy.Most days, he would probably have named Beethoven as his personal number one, although the doctorate on Claude Debussy he abandoned at the end of his days as a mature student, and his rave reviews for Osmo Vanskarsquos concerts of Sibelius with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, placed other famously curmudgeonly composers high in his esteem.Alongside these major names of the repertoire, Michael was always searching for the new. Like many he mourned the passing of the RSNOrsquos annual Musica Nova season of experiment and innovation at the University of Glasgow, and was an assiduous attender and reviewer of the week of Plug concerts by young composers at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Just as he had been one of the first critics to champion the work of James MacMillan, before the famous Proms performance of The Confession of Isobel Gowdie catapulted him to national attention, so he heard fascinating new voices in Gareth Williams and other composers in those student showcases.If Michael had the skill to write about new, often challenging, music in an accessible way, he was also as far from snobbish about the popular end of the classical spectrum as it was possible to be.Certainlya global vocal superstar like Domingo or Carreras appeared to be phoning in their Scottish performance, he didnrsquot hesitate to say so, but at the same time he would be one of the few ldquoserious music critics to be in his favoured seat in the stalls at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall for the Christmas run of concerts from commercial promoter Raymond Gubbay. That was partly because the classical pops repertoire that filled the auditorium deserved its share of his attention, but also because of a consciousness that those events, like pantomime for actors and theatres, were crucial to the sustainability of the careers of freelance musicians and the ldquogig economy, before that term was more widely applied.Something of that same sensibility lay behind the first time he and I worked very closely together, in the face of some corporate opposition. At the start of December , we both attended a press conference at the BBCrsquos Queen Margaret Drive studios at which plans were revealed to amalgamate the Orchestra of Scottish Opera and BBC SSO, in which the Scottish Arts Council described itself as an ldquohonest broker. It was presented as something of a fait accompli, designed to streamline arts funding in Scotland, safeguard the BBC orchestrarsquos future and stem the losses of the opera company.Michael immediately realised that the price would be paid in the jobs of musicians, their union confirmed its concern, and we ed to the office determined to file a newsand analysispackage that would tell a fuller story. Although it was clear that our superiors had already been briefed by some of Scotlandrsquos great and good with the aim of ensuring The Herald was ldquoonside when the plan was made public, we were able to report as we saw it.The fall-out was a saga of inquiries and committees that went on for years, but the end result is that the Orchestra of Scottish Opera survives, albeit part-time and with a parallel identity as a freelance outfit, and the BBC SSO thrives, the mainstay of Radio rsquos Beethoven broadcasting this past week.It was characteristic of Michael that I learned of the brain tumour that was the start of his decline with the words: ldquoYou know how you have always wanted to go the St Magnus Festival in Orkney  Well, this summer itrsquos your gig. In time I took on more of his work, although his recovery from that first diagnosis was remarkable and Michaelrsquos reviews were still appearing in these pages five years after his retiral in .Staff music critics on newspapers were an endangered species during most of Michael Tumeltyrsquos career, but you would never have guessed from his ebullience. He will be long recalled as one of the most robust, reliable and passionate of the breed."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW   Lockdown with Stacey Dooley and Jamie Genevieve","story":"Jamie Genevieversquos Great Indoors ***RICHARD and Judy, Jools Holland, Jamie Oliver hellip is there anyone left out there who is not making programmes from home  I wouldnrsquot be surprisedit turns out HM The Queenrsquos broadcasts were filmed by Philip on his iPhone.But needs must in these lockdown days, particularly for those who earn a crust from having their coupons on screen.Stacey Dooley was in lockdown with her Strictly partner turned boyfriend Kevin Clton.

Restaurant insiders and analysts fear that we could lose half of our restaurants to the lockdown.Just imagine the effect this would have on our cityscapes. Think of all the people whorsquod lose their jobs ndash chefs, front-of-house staff, suppliers ndash all the businesses that would be forced to stop trading, tragic economic casualties of coronavirus.Michelin-starred chef Marcus Wareing recently warned that the UK restaurant industry, which is worth pound billion per year, and which employs hundreds of thousands of workers, could collapse.As one top Scottish chef told me, the effects of coronavirus have been ldquobrutal. ldquoEvery week wersquore in a bigger hole. Rent due is building up. Our debt is mounting. We canrsquot just keep on borrowing or wersquod be committing economic suicide.He says that all the great strides our restaurant industry has made in recent years, putting Scotland on the map as a first-rate restaurant destination, could be crushed, setting us back decades in gastronomic terms.If yoursquore not in the business, you probably wonrsquot know why restaurants are suffering more than other sectors of the economy.The UK Government decided to exclude from its furlough scheme calculation any earnings restaurant employees got from the lsquotroncrsquo, thatrsquos the traditional system that pools service charges, redistributing them in salaries.So, instead of restaurant staff getting furlough payments calculated on  percent of their earnings, many are getting more like  percent.Canrsquot restaurants just adapt by doing more home delivery, more click and collect  Some can, because their cooking styles lends itself to that.But for our best restaurants, where so much depends on the careful last-minute preparation and assembly of several elements, takeaway is near impossible.Some highly rated restaurants have gamely started doing takeaways, by relaxing their fine dining styles and focusing on more informal, transportable dishes.But no-one is under any illusions. For restaurateurs, these are emergency responses, not long-term solutions.As for diners, well for me at least, a takeaway is a poor substitute for a restaurant visit.Letrsquos hope that our restaurants can stagger through until lockdown ends, understanding landlords and banks allowing.In the meantime, we must have an urgent conversation about how they might reopen their doors sooner rather than later. On the upside, the YouGov poll, carried at the peak of coronavirus infection and public anxiety, shows that  per cent of us would consider eating out.But on what terms might that be  Here, I share the sentiments of UK restaurant legend Jeremy King, of Wolseley fame, who recently said: ldquoI certainly have no interest in going to a place where I am sitting in isolation, surrounded by Perspex screens and served by someone in a mask and gloves. Wherersquos the fun in that Some form of social distancing must be put in placecustomers are going to . Just how much though If the UK and Scottish governments insist on the scientically baseless two-metre rule, that would spell the demise of most restaurants.The requirement is impractical: most chefs work about one metre apart. And restaurants operate on tight margins, so a severe reduction in the number of covers they can accept would mean that they were losing money hand over fist.The WHO recommends a more reasonable one-metre measure. Already Sweden, Italy, France, Norway, Denmark, Austria, and New Zealand have ruled that one metre distancing between tables is sufficient.People who decide to be lsquolockdown lersrsquo may never eat out again. No restaurant can ever guarantee them absolute safety from this virus.But many of us who love eating out will be prepared to live with that risk and support restaurants when they reopen , that is, our governments give them the chance."},{"url":null,"title":"cail-bruich-glasgow---ron-mackennas-home-delivery-review","story":"GlasgowTHERE will be a moment when unpacking that I look at the number of boxes, tubs, packets, the breezy yet voluminous instructions, the raw asparagus, and wonder out loud ina groany, moany wayIkea is behind this meal.You know: some planks, sandpaper, a piece of bent metal, lots of pictograms ndash be quicker cutting down a tree.

A queue that was for apizza restaurant.While over the hill and far away, well, down to the lights anyway, we were the only customers troubling the masked servers at Cail Bruich. Of course, this meal had to be pre-booked, and is not cheap.There are rewards though. A loaf and a half of a very pretty fresh-baked bread is unveiled during the unboxing, to have its tummy tickled in the oven then smeared with wild garlic pesto. Tubs of cold watermelon gazpacho with rose water, too, with slightly dodgy-looking crumbs of feta drting atop, which I turn my not inconsiderable nose up at initially, then taste. Then praise.We actually do have to cook the asparagus itself, perilously close to a bridge too far that, then plate with curried egg and tart little pickled vegetables.Therersquos cod crudo, yes, raw fish athome ndash gulp. Dragged awkwardly into complete glory by the addition ofcaviar, peas, shellfish vinaigrette.Refreshing to see that Cail Bruich has got into the spirit of things by lacing the five paragraph heating instructions with a bit of sauce: ldquomake it nice, ldquodonrsquot forget the artistic plating, ldquomake it look sexy they exhort. ldquoSprinkle with good quality salt flake too, but at this point Irsquom thinking: ah shut-up.No amount of fun is ever going to save that other sous-vide dish. Flavour shamed by that beef the sous-vided smoked kohlrabi, orange glazed chicory and Jersey royalsand black garlic like were uncomfortable strangers at party with no booze. Inidually okay, but together just stodgy slabs of monochrome flavours and textures.Back to form with desserts that, like the starters, largely salute the chefrsquos ability for completely pre-preparing ready to eat food. We have then perfectly pleasant, tart yet tangy mango cremes from plastic dishes. And thoroughly enjoy them. Even though Markies probably do something visually very similar.Itrsquos been a posh meal this, easy to make look good, clearly better than anything that can be knocked out quickly at home. Way to go.Cail Bruich Great Western RoadGlasgowTel:    Menu: Fine dining from Scotlandrsquos larder.

People were indulging in all these activities across Scotlands beaches yesterday, with many having travelled out of their local areas for recreation, although this isnt supposedly allowed until May .Phase  also envisages agriculture and forestry resuming but in the fields of lambs I see from my house the farmers have never ndash thankfully ndash stopped working.Phase  also encompasses \"no longer discouraging takeaways and drive-throughs from opening\" but again thankfully, takeaways in Anstruther, Cupar and St Andrews have been open for some weeks.It seems to me that Ms Sturgeons route map is behind the curve, and she needs to get in step with what the great Scottish public is already doing.Otherwise this intricate, and illogical staggered plan of dos and donts will only undermine the credibility of the First Minister and empower ever more people to go their own way.Linda Holt , Anstruther.MISHAL Husain of BBC Radio  interviewed David Nabarro from the World Health Organisation last Friday.I was shouting at the radio in total agreement with his addressing the issue of personal behaviour and personal responsibility in this pandemic.He raised the very important question, does the population get it  Do we really understand what is going on and how we need to behave  Clearly, we should only unlock when the answer to this is yes. I fear, too many of us believe that unlocking is \"back to normal\".The success of this virus,you want to call it that, is in its ability to exploit weaknesses. The resulting pandemic has certainly exposed the underlying health issues in our population as well those in our systems, our key services. These in turn have also exposed weak and slow political decision-making and in some cases incompetent messaging, the consequences for which in terms of death will have political and financial cost which will play out in due course.Dr Nabarro stated that \"its personal behaviour as well thats extremely important in reducing the likelihood of explosive outbreaks developing over the summer and into the autumn\".When asked about the setting of dates for reducing restrictions he continued: \"My request to all countries, that rather than giving precise dates, they say well release the lockdown when we know that weve got the defence mechanisms in place, when we know that our people understand the severity of this virus.\"Before we take the next small unlocking step, we need to check that we all know what we have to do. My fear is that we are nowhere near putting a tick in that last box. I think the politicians need to be honest and pay more attention to the messaging. It feels like too many of us have the impression that unlocking is a binary event that puts us back to normal. Lets face it, we arent going back to normal any time soon, certainly not this year. Our ability to understand where we are with this, to understand what we need to do and to adopt those behaviours is the next test. If we fail here, that is a weakness the virus will exploit next, for sure.Lets stop and think it through, what effect is my behaviour having on my family and others, perhaps more vulnerable  Could my behaviour make others anxious  Is my behaviour helping or hindering the transmission of this virus Im sure though that we are smart enough to get our heads around this and start really caring for each other so that perhaps well never get back to normal, but to something much better.David Morrish, Banchory.PANDEMICS are not like other global crises. They are dynamic, full of uncertainty, spread very fast as a result of modern transport and communications and affect whole populations. Yet we routinely ignore these low probability, high impact threats without thinking broadly and deeply about the disruption and cost. And we often quickly forget afterwards or fall rapidly into previous behaviours.I hope that the Scottish Government will commission a public inquiry in the near future so we can all learn the lessons ndash good and bad ndash from Covid- and its aftermath.Such an inquiry needs to draw on evidence, opinion and good ideas from all segments of our society from the public and private sectors and from academia and research and development. It must be impartial and transparent.It needs to consider what can be done in the future by those at the coal face as well as in Holyrood and all parts of our citizenship in between. Input needs to be collected now not when this pandemic has subsided.Lastly, lessons captured need to be learned and converted into best practice by an organisation set up especially and dedicated to ensure we improve resilience across our society and are better prepared for the next similar challenge.Malcolm Warr, Prestwick.Read more: Sturgeon publishes route map out of lockdown"},{"url":null,"title":"inside-scotlands-school-butlers","story":"IT CANrsquoT be happening. Not in Paisley. A school for butlers  Thatrsquos like training sea captains from a base in the Sahara. Or goat herders in the middle of Manhattan.Paisley is a once-proud industrial town. Its threads held the world together, the nearby car plant kept generations in work as did the internationally-renowned carpet factory where John Byrne learned to mix colour.Itrsquos also a town thatrsquos famous for defiance. Paisley, since the early th century has been tough and class aware, revealing an angry voice so rebellious that Tory Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli warned of its unions, \"Keep your eye on Paisley\".So how can the town which once manufactured Robertsonrsquos marmalade be manufacturing servants to supply the toffs of the world Well, it is. Rosset Bespoke Butlers operates from the town, a school for butler training set up by Simeon Rosset which sends its successful pupils out into the world to work for Arab princes, Russian oligarchs, Scots lairds and the occasional rock star.Rosset, who has butlered for the likes of Tony Blair, Kylie Minogue and Quincy Jones, employs two full-time and almost  part time staff and his company has been running for six years.Why choose Paisley as a base  Well, we come to the sheer incongruity of Jeeves and Woostering in the White Cart town later. But here at his home in Ralston, a suburb of cosy bungalows in the east end of the town, he rewinds on how he came to be a butler ndash and why the profession means so much to him. ldquoI began working as a waiter and a pot-washer from the age of , in a Margate hotel where his mother was manager, he says in soft voice, sounding genial and eager to please .ldquoBy the age of , I wasnrsquot sure what to do with my le but then I landed the job of restaurant manager at the incredible [th century] Leeds Castle in Kent.ldquoThe head butler noted what I was doing and suggested I join his staff, and hersquod train me up. l became and footman, and loved the idea of being a butler, learning skills that were  years old. I really got caught up in the sense of history that came with the job.Yet, as a restaurant manager hersquod had control, power. How could he surrender this to enter a world of deference and submission  ldquoWell, in hospitality, unless you are at the very top, itrsquos a hard slog. And in butlering I could see the possibility for advancement. And I also liked the real challenge of being a butler, looking after Prime Ministers and Presidents. And the iety of the work.But, still, yoursquore paid to be acquiescent  ldquoOf course, he says, unriled. ldquoBut my clients, or principals as we call them, have been people at the top of their game, CEOs of oil companies, crown princes, rock stars. In terms of the challenges and rewards, itrsquos more akin to being a senior manager in a company.He adds, smiling: ldquoAnd donrsquot we all answer to someone You can see why an Arab prince or a pop star would employ Rosset. Hersquos calm as a summer pond. You just know he can think on his black-brogued feet. ldquoYou canrsquot be stressed out. Ever. At least, not on the surface. Wersquore like swans, paddling like hell under the water.Rosset offers an early example of hard paddling when his diplomacy skills were tested to the limit. ldquoI worked at Leeds Castle during the preliminary Northern Ireland peace summit conferences, and I was in charge, looking after  or so dignitaries, keeping the likes of Tony Blair happy.ldquoWe also had Gerry Adams and Ian Paisley to look after but neither would agree to be in the same room as the other. I had to instruct staff to move one out of the room before the other would enter.He grins: ldquoIt was a question of gently steering them where we wanted them to go, yet let them think they were in control. And at this time I realised I wanted this to be my permanent career.Rosset went on to work for a huge range of employers. Is it dferent looking after a politician than a rock star, for example  ldquoOh yes! he exclaims. ldquoWith rock stars yoursquore dealing with their parties, a fast-paced le. And they sometimes like to flaunt the fact they have a butler. Itrsquos a symbol of success. Politicians, however, tend to be more discreet, subtle.ldquoBusiness people are also dferent. They want to have their big parties, but in private. His smile is a little furtive. ldquoThey donrsquot want the shareholders to know what theyrsquore spending.The most demanding principles, he says, are the Russians. Is this because they are new money  ldquoYes, and theyrsquove often killed off most of the old money. But then Irsquove looked after some Russian billionaires whorsquove been some of the nicest people yoursquoll ever meet.ldquoAnd the lsquoold moneyrsquo you tend to look after these days turns out to be Arab, whorsquove had the great wealth for several generations.Rosset wonrsquot reveal detail of what the butler saw, or name those whom hersquos worked with for a long time. ldquoThose are the ones who will get scared ndash because I know too much. But he will say hersquos short-termed with the likes of Bono, Kylie, Sir Clf Richard and Quincy Jones.Did he have to contend with groupies much in the pop world  ldquoOh yes, he smiles. ldquoYou have to manage that whole situation. He laughs: ldquoClf Richard had the most groupies of them all, and the most committed of any Irsquove ever seen.Rosset adds that not only do each of his principals need to be looked after dferently, sometimes the same person needs looking after in a dferent way. ldquoFor example, the night before you could be with them at a party. The next day theyrsquore with their we and children and the following day you could be with them on their private plane or yacht.Has this prince of butlers been shocked by the wanton hedonism hersquos witnessed ldquoWell, Irsquove seen a few sights, he says, with the calm understatement that would have made Upstairs Downstairsrsquo Mr Hudson proud. ldquoAlthough Irsquove heard incredible stories from older butlers about the s and the orgies.He grins: ldquoSince the noughties things have become less naughty. But I did look after a Russian oligarch who, at am danced on the roof of his Lamborghini, wearing just his boxer shorts after swimming with a load of young girls who were now cheering him on.Irsquom guessing he wasnrsquot too worried about a little scratching  ldquoI donrsquot think he cared. In fact, that reminds of one guest leaving a party after having had too much to drink the night before.ldquoI politely suggested he may not wish to drive and I said Irsquod at least drive his car through the very narrow gates. He refused my offer with an angry voice saying no one but him drove his Lamborghini Murcielago. So he got into the car and proceeded to drive it right into a stone wall. His eyes offer a mischievous twinkle ldquoBut as a butler you donrsquot judge, you simply order them a taxi.He must have a very tough tongue, given the times itrsquos been bitten over the years  ldquoYes, itrsquos not the sort of job in which you can go to HR and complain. For example, I once worked for a lady who had a party for  guests and I opened eight bottles of wine. It wasnrsquot all drunk and she insisted I should pay for the wine. I didnrsquot work for her again. There are those who test you in the beginning, to check out your character. And there are the eccentrics.ldquoOne lady had a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice at the same time every day, but one afternoon she said lsquoSimeon, you know I hate orange juice!rsquo I replied, lsquoMy mistake, madam. Can I get you something  to drink rsquoAre butlers asked to squeeze toothpaste, as itrsquos claimed Prince Charles expected of his staff  ldquoI know some who will clip their clients toenailsasked. Personally, no one could pay me enough to look after their toenails. But in general terms, there is no job thatrsquos too big or too small. The principals donrsquot often grind the butlers into the ground. They are so hard to replace.Rosset, at , loves this anachronistic le, playing out a role which was created in another time. ldquoYou may be shooting or fishing with princes and find it so enjoyable, or working at a party on a yacht. When I looked after Quincy Jones he told me fantastic stories of his world. It was delight to look after him and be trusted with his tales.Does he become friends with his charges  ldquoPerhaps lsquofriendsrsquo isnrsquot the right word but you certainly become friendly. And sometimes you feel like their family. But you always have to remember therersquos a line you canrsquot cross. Some butlers forget this ndash but not me. For example, I donrsquot sit in the presence of my clients. Thatrsquos not because they donrsquot want me to. Itrsquos because I remember the protocol, the rules of engagement.Are his clients generous  ldquoIrsquove had some lovely presents from principals.\"He says they prefer giving gts than cash as it shows they care more. \"But I do know of one butler who had been working with an Arab prince and when they parted for the last time expected a tip, given how generous the prince had been to others. But as he drove the prince to his private jet for the last time ndash nothing. He wondered what he had done wrong.ldquoAt the very last minute, he said to the prince, lsquoWhat will I do with the car rsquo And the prince replied, looking at the new Range Rover, Keep it, itrsquos yours.\"Does he have a problem with this conspicuous flaunting of excess wealth  ldquoI donrsquot have a problem with the wealthy who spend their money, those who have a lot of staff and they pay them well. I have a problem with the Warren Buffetts of this world who donrsquot spend it.Yet,he loved the le of serving the super-rich, yachting and flying around the world with oligarchs and princes, why move to training up others to do same  ldquoThe nature of the job is to go wherever ndash and for whenever. My last employer, one of the most successful businessmen in the Middle East, would say: lsquoPack the bags, wersquore on the yacht tomorrow. Donrsquot know when wersquoll be back.rsquo And that works to a certain extent when yoursquore married, but not when yoursquore married with children.Rossetrsquos le change came on meeting his Paisley-born we Claire, an architect, in Belgravia.

Yet, every time I came to Scotland we struggled to find local staff.He figured on training them up himself. ldquoI knew that Scots can make great butlers. They have just the right level of cheekiness and respect.Rosset also acts as an facilitator for butlers looking for work. ldquoI try not to be like a recruitment agency. Thatrsquos too formal. What I like to do is put the right people with the right person.Business, up until the virus crises, has been great. His highly compressed courses run for two to four weeks, depending on the applicantrsquos previous work le experience. It costs around pound a week to learn the likes of party planning, dining etiquette and security. ldquoI donrsquot know of another course which offers sessions from spreadsheets to snipers, he says smiling. He offers a free week a year for those who canrsquot afford it.Butlering, he says, can be very lucrative. ldquoThe best butlers are very highly paid. The Brits are considered the best, followed by the Swiss. And there are many in Saudi earning k a month, tax-free. And there is also a demand for female butlers. Lots of Middle Eastern women want to be looked after by women.He smiles. ldquoMaybe the new Alfred in the Batman movie will be a woman. That would be great for business.What of setting up shop in Paisley, the Ferguslie Park-Gosford Park contrast  ldquoWell, butlers are supposed to be working class. And why not see Paisley as a base  It has great access, people come to us from all over the world [his No  is from Brazil and itrsquos a lot less expensive than an office in Edinburgh.His Paisley base has been so successful Rosset is planning to expand. \"I want to open an office in Beijing, with one of my former trainees and London.Rosset laughs: ldquoThe business ad will look like the side of Del Boyrsquos van lsquoRosset Bespoke Butlers lsquoBeijing, London. Paisleyrsquo.Itrsquos hard to see Rossetrsquos business not thriving. The super-rich always survive, particularly in times of crises. And Rosset is sharp and ready and willing to please those who pay for the pleasure. He didnrsquot offer a cup of tea during chatbut the butlerrsquos butler knows implicitly the role.ldquoPeople said to me this business wouldnrsquot work in Scotland but what they donrsquot know of is the huge wealth here. Irsquove seen the estates and castles that are not publicised and they look like Versailles. There is no shortage of serious money.It seems a great job ndash for those who can hold back a laugh when some clown wraps his supercar around a wall, and be wrong even when yoursquore right. ldquoThatrsquos it, he says. ldquoFor the right person itrsquos a fantastic le.http:www.rossetbespokebutlers "},{"url":null,"title":"parklife-green-spaces-mean-us-need-hold-dear","story":"If yoursquove seen the film yoursquoll remember it. Evenyou havenrsquot you may have witnessed a iation of the scene playing out somewhere near where you live. The air rle is a fictional extra we could do without, but the important real-le constituents are too much booze, too few clothes, sunshine and green space. Whatever quantities you mix them in, the end result is often the same: mischief and tumult, such as you only encounter in a Scottish park.Of course thatrsquos not the whole story, by any means. For generations Scots have turned to parks and green spaces for past-times other than riot and bother. Blether, leisure and dog-walking are the prime uses, but more than that our parks have become emblems of civic pride and community cohesion, and as such we often invest them with their own lore and mythology. That can turn on their being viewed as symbols of urban self-determination or of history, but it can also be personal and grounded in an inidualrsquos experience of a particular space. Maybe you met your partner in one or walked an aged parent round one. Maybe it was there you had a first childhood encounter with a bicycle or football that would change your le forever.Conceptual artist Martin Boyce, a graduate of Glasgow School of Art and the winner of the  Turner Prize, has made deeply personal work inspired by a childhood spent hanging around the municipal parks of his hometown of Hamilton. His  Tramway exhibition, Our Love Is Like The Flowers, The Rain, The Sea And The Hours, features stylized versions of trees, benches and bins . The work is now owned by Tate Britain, which describes it as alluding to ldquoan urban park at night which is ldquoalways supposed to convey the feeling of a winter hinterland. Boyce himself has spoken a lot about his interest in utopias ndash the ones the urban planners dream up for kids in places like Hamilton and the ones the kids fashion for themselves out of whatrsquos left when the swings have been knotted together, the roundabout torched and the whole thing exposed to decades of grim Scottish weather. ldquoI wanted to have that same feeling of a space you might have occupied as a teenager, that place you find for yourself, he has said. ldquoExterior spaces like a park at night. The kind of urban park, that gap between the city and the suburbs, or gaps inside the city.Yoursquoll find parks ndash small and large, obvious and hidden away, tended or not tended, utopian or otherwise ndash in any and all Scottish cities and towns. Glasgow Green, for instance, has been integral to the cityrsquos notion of itself for hundreds of years. It has been camped on by Jacobites, wandered on by James Watt as he cooked up improvements to his steam engine and tramped over by gatherings of Chartists, Suffragettes and anti-war campaigners . More recently, it has been the site of pop concerts and rock festivals. Edinburgh, meanwhile, has Holyrood Park and The Meadows, which narrowly escaped being buried under a six-lane motorway in the s. Aberdeen, Dundee, Stirling, Perth and Inverness all have their own versions. We also have two national parks ndash covering Loch Lomond and the Cairngorms ndash and dozens of large country parks, often located near to or on the periphery of cities, and in the estates of grand houses. Zoom in on a city map and yoursquoll also find a patchwork of tiny parks and playgrounds in suburbs and housing estates. Some might not even have a name.Parkle: The small joys of our local parks, by Teddy JamiesonldquoPublic parks and spaces have always been really important in Scotland, says Julie Procter, chief executive of Green Space Scotland , a charity. ldquoGlasgow Green is the oldest park but also in Victorian times we saw people like Andrew Carnegie and other philanthropic industrialists starting to endow public parks. We also saw lots of parks coming into existence through public subscription which,we fast forward to the st century, would be like the equivalent of crowd funding now.As someone who spent decades living in city centre tenement flats, Irsquove spent hours and hours in Scotlandrsquos parks over the years. Irsquove met fantasy role players clashing swords like they were in an episode of Game Of Thrones, Quidditch teams practising for the start of the new season , unicyclists, jugglers, slack-line walkers and any number of people playing gridiron, frisbee, bowls, boules, baseball and, of course, cricket. All human le is out there enjoying the space and the sunshine.Not at the moment, though. With the country in lockdown the countryrsquos parks are either shut or have restricted access, and barbecues and impromptu gatherings of sunbathers or tinny-guzzling revellers are much frowned upon by the constabulary. Also proscribed are the more benign gatherings and activities which parks host. And so shuttered gates and official signage are depriving us of the many uplting aspects of park le ndash parents playing with their children, children playing with each other, people laughing and joking, pop-up stalls selling falafels or flat whites, joggers of every size and colour in Lycra to match.Donrsquot it always seem to go that you donrsquot know what yoursquove got rsquotil itrsquos gone  So sang Joni Mitchell in Big Yellow Taxi. Our parks arenrsquot gone but the lockdown is a great opportunity to think about what le might be likethey were. Thatrsquos not as fancul as it sounds, either. Research by GSS found that over the last nine years council spend on parks and green spaces has reduced by % and, while % of urban Scots think it important to have green space in their community, peoplersquos ratings of the quality of the areas provided has dropped dramatically in line with the cuts. That fact was already impacting on their use well before the start of the lockdown.ldquoAnecdotally it doesnrsquot take much in terms of litter not being cleared and bins not being emptied for a park to go from somewhere you want to spend time to somewhere you donrsquot want to let your kids play out, says Procter. ldquoAnd what wersquove seen is that budgets have been spent on what you might call the destination parks and less on the doorstep, neighbourhood parks. Theyrsquore the ones that are even more important for us at the moment.How important is revealed by another piece of GSS research, a recent cost-benefit study undertaken with the City of Edinburgh Council. It found that for every pound spent on Edinburghrsquos parks and green space, pound came back in terms of social, economic and environmental benefits, to an annual total of pound million. On top of that you can add other benefits that might be less easy to quanty: on mental health, for instance, or that primal thrill kids get when they can belt across an expanse of grass longer than the average suburban garden.For Procter, that means we have to start thinking very dferently about parks and green spaces, about how we resource them, what theyrsquore for and what more they can do for us. If therersquos to be a post-pandemic renewal of the social contract, letrsquos make sure they feature in discussion about health and health security.ldquoIt is going to be a challenge because we are heading into a pretty deep recession, but there is now an opportunity to think about how we make sure our parks and green spaces, which were seen by politicians as absolutely crucial for our exercise during lockdown, continue to be invested in to deliver those same benefits.That will involve change and innovation. For instance, one way to safely bring children back to school might be to teach them outdoors as much as possible. Could the post-pandemic UK see a boost in funding for the nascent forest schools programme  A second way is to use parks and green spaces to generate power. Itrsquos not as crazy as it sounds and in fact itrsquos already happening: Saughton Park in Edinburgh, recently re-developed and an unheralded gem in the west of the city complete with skatepark, bandstand, walled garden and cafeacute, has horizontal and vertical ground-source heat pumps installed under its playing pitches. Last year, work started on a micro-hydro project which will use an Archimedes Screw to generate power from the nearby Water of Leith. Finally, with the availability and production of fresh food also much in the news, therersquos the prospect of using parks and green spaces much as they were used in the Second World War ndash to grow produce, only with ground source power used to heat greenhouses and poly-tunnels. Put it all together and itrsquos possible for any large park to be economically self-sufficient.Soanything good can come out of the Covid  pandemic it may be that therersquos a chance to hit reset where parks and green spaces are concerned ndash to force a reappraisal by councils, governments and whichever inheritors of Andrew Carnegiersquos philanthropic zeal might be reading this of the need to create, maintain and, crucially, to fund them.

And as for beer gardens reopening... well, excuse me while I find my disposable hanky.Alas, the reality is that little will change immediately, and much that is unwelcome will remain for some time, including of course the coronavirus.John Swinney yesterday warned society would have to change to keep Covid- suppressed to help avoid a second wave this winter.That means new forms of school, work and public transport. People will be stuck in home offices, washing their hands raw, and keeping apart from friends for the foreseeable future.The big change the route map did bring was a sht away from following strict rules such as ldquostay at home to following your own judgment on keeping yourself and others safe.There was scoffing when Boris Johnson called it using ldquogood British common sense, but Nicola Sturgeon came close to saying the same thing.Much more ldquopersonal choice and personal judgment would be required, she said yesterday, looking hesitant but also relieved that some of the burden of decision-making was passing from her shoulders to ours.Good judgment has also been much needed at Holyrood this week.Before the route map distracted us all, the Government was having a pretty rough time of it.More examples emerged of people who were close to Scotlandrsquos ground zero for Covid - the Nike conference outbreak in Edinburgh in late February - not contacted by public health officials.Ms Sturgeon insisted there was no cover-up, and patient confidentiality was why nothing was said until a BBC documentary made it public.In a sign of unease, she shted her language. Previously, she said ministers decided not to publicise the event. Now she said the health team could have done so, but chose not to.She also retreated behind the official definition of a contact as being someone who had been within m of an infected person for  minutes or more. Other contacts didnrsquot count.But, as the EUrsquos Centre for Disease Prevention and Control noted in its advice on contact tracing in late March, ldquothe -minute limit is arbitrarily selected for practical purposes. Public health authorities may consider some persons who had a shorter duration of contact with the case as having had high-risk exposure, based on inidual risk assessments.The first two cases of Covid confirmed in Scotland in early March involved people recently ed from Northern Italy. The third was caught at the Nike conference, here in Scotland, out first homegrown case of transmission. Yet the Scottish Government never mentioned itBut confidentiality isnrsquot much of an excuse. Why didnrsquot officials ask those involved to agree an announcement  Yoursquod be surprised what patients will allow to be made known.Take Scotlandrsquos first Covid case. The Government has only ever said the March ldquoindex case lived in Tayside and and had been in Italy.But I can tell you he was a -year-old non-smoker who took regular exercise and called the NHS after developing a -hour fever and cough two days after he flew home from Milan after a weekrsquos holiday.Hersquod watched a rugby match in Rome and travelled with his partner and two friends in a hire car through Lombardy, Veneto and Tuscany, stayed in private rented accommodation and was unaware of any contact with Covid cases.When his test came back positive after two days of self-isolation, he was taken by ambulance to hospital in a surgical mask and arrived with a heart rate of  beats per minute and blood pressure of  over .Public health undertook contact tracing and testing and no further cases were identied.Luckily, I can also tell you our patient was discharged after eight days and two negative swab tests.The strain of virus that infected him was dubbed Scotland CVR .I can tell you all these things because they were published in a medical journal within a fortnight of him getting out of hospital thanks to him giving his informed consent.The idea absolutely nothing could be said about the Nike outbreak for more than two months - despite eight of the ten Scottish attendees catching Covid - continues to defy belief.As that row rumbled on, another blew up about Health Secretary Jeane Freeman and the number of elderly people hoicked out of hospitals into care homes without Covid testing.She initially suggested it was . In fact it was  in March. She apologised and corrected the record. The Scottish Tories called for her scalp.Jackson Carlaw wrote to Ms Sturgeon claiming it was impossible to see how ldquopublic confidence can be maintained in the health secretary.I would suggest the First Minister tells Mr Carlaw to get stuffed.The politics of the pandemic are clearly getting sharper on all sides.Sir Keir Starmer is going through Boris Johnson at PMQs like a scalpel.The Tories, worried by how the Prime Minister is doing compared to Ms Sturgeon, feel obliged to pitch in and try to change the narrative.But is changing the health secretary in a health crisis best for Scotland When they look around the Scottish cabinet, who do they think would do a better job than Ms Freeman, who opposition MSPs privately rate as bloody good.Would the Tories want Ms Sturgeon to recall Shona Robison perhaps It was she, after all, who promised to eradicate delayed discharges as health secretary, failed miserably, and bequeathed Ms Freeman the backlog that had to be cut pronto at the start of the outbreak. Fancy that, Mr Carlaw  No, I thought not.The Government is getting things wrong, no doubt. Some will turn out to have been badly handled, in some cases with tragic consequences.Ministers appear unduly secretive and in denial about shortcomings.But while opposition and media scrutiny is vital, and Government candour about mistakes key to avoiding repeats, this is not the moment for heads to roll.I donrsquot blame Ms Sturgeon for bulldozing aside such calls. If she concedes too much and starts firing folk, shersquoll never escape from it.Her government, and its efforts on Covid-, would slide into a political quicksand. The rolling recriminations and Holyrood drama would shake public confidence in precarious times.The Tories and other parties will get their chance to bag scalps later, and the voters will give their verdict in the  election.

I cannot but compare our Scottish Governments cover-up with the prompt and appropriate contact tracing system enacted by Public Health Ireland.On February , I and three friends ed to Glasgow from Italy, where we had been at the Italy v Scotland rugby international. We travelled via Milan and Dublin. On February  I received a phone call from Public Health Ireland to tell me I had been in contact with the coronavirus. A female passenger on the flight from Milan to Dublin had tested positive to the virus. All passengers were told to self-isolate and those with certain symptoms were tested. Fortunately, I was able to be tested and found to be negative. Public Health Ireland quickly held a press conference, highlighted this case and reassured the public that they were on top of any possible outbreak by acting swtly.The contrast between Scotlands slow and ineffective contact tracing system with that in Ireland is stark. The contrast is clear in the figures for deaths from coronavirus. The Republic of Ireland with a population of . million had on May  , coronavirus deaths while Scotlandon May  recorded , coronavirus deaths.The Scottish Governments handling of the Covid- emergency has been slow and ineffective to date: whether thats regarding PPE shortages, the neglect of the vulnerable in our nursing homes or introducing a contact tracing system. Much of this may be down to Scottish Government incompetence, but the political culture we have in Scotland of never admitting error or weakness could be leading to more needless deaths.Danny Crawford, Glasgow G.UNLIKE Councillor Linda Holt , I found the First Ministers route map to be clear, concise and measured. Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly stressed the necessity for all of us to stay at home during this pandemic, and we are only now seeing the easing of restrictions because the vast majority of sensible people have followed that advice.Like many others I was shocked to see on television the crowds on Portobellos promenade, and Councillor Holt claims that those scenes were repeated on other beaches. It is understandable that people, especially those without gardens, are weary of staying indoors and were tempted out into the spring sunshine, but regrettably their actions could have dire consequences for themselves and the wider population. Councillor Holt contends that Ms Sturgeons route map is \"behind the curve\" with regard to takeaways and working farmers, but whilst acknowledging that takeaways could still operate, Ms Sturgeon has always urged people to think carefully before leaving home for all but essential purposes, and I dont think anyone would ever want or expect farmers to stop looking after their animals.Rather than criticising Ms Sturgeon, may I respectfully suggest to Councillor Holt that the best thing she and all of us can do is to follow the advice from the First Minister and her advisers as they carefully lead us through this most distressing and challenging of times.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE First Minister complained that the UK Government message when changed from Stay Home to Stay Alert was confusing, although many felt it was pretty simple, straightforward and self-explanatory.I wonder how much clearer her followers and the public in general found her \"remain cautious\" instruction following her announcement yesterday regarding a future relaxation of the lockdown Pettiness personied.

It is a simple concept at its core ndash a regular unconditional payment to each inidual. In contrast to the current system of social security, Universal Credit, which is characterised by punitive sanctions and conditionality, a basic income does not change as you move in and out of work, and has no requirements attached to it in terms of activity or use.The Covid- pandemic has highlighted the economic precarity prevalent in our economy to a signicant degree, with many people, whether through jobs in the gig economy or due to self-employment, slipping through the support net that has been introduced by the UK Government. Basic income offers a chance to both respond to the current crisis, but also to create a new foundation for a reinvigorated social contract for the future.This is strengthened by the evidence of support shown in the polling released by Mark Dfley in this paper today. Of course, data from a single survey does not provide unquestionable proof that the public would back the introduction of basic income. Work on increasing public understanding of the issue would need to be undertaken before more informed estimates of support are given. Having said that, such strong, albeit partial, evidence should, at the very least, lead to a fuller and more considered discussion of the issue.So, what next for UBI in Scotland The findings of this survey demonstrate that there is public appetite for basic income to be explored in more detail as a policy proposal. This opens up space for those who have expressed political support, such as the SNP and Greens, to start from a position of potential public support. It also opens up the space for those opposed or agnostic on basic income to join the discussion.Willie Rennie recently called for a national convention to discuss the idea between the Scottish and UK Governments ndash this would appear to chime with public interest. And the level of public support across socioeconomic and demographic groups offers a chance for the Scottish Conservatives to contribute ndash this does not have to dilute their current opposition, but rather would create an important space for critique of proposed policies.Meanwhile, while Scottish Labour have been relatively silent on basic income on a Scottish level , much of the local activity and interest in Scotland has been driven by Labour councillors.This crisis has shown the frailty and insecurity of our current economic system, and the profound impacts this has on citizens. Our immediate priority, of course, must be in taking the action required to get us through the crisis with as little loss of le and financial security as possible. An emergency basic income, paid over the duration of the crisis, could offer a stable foundation for people to plan on during the turmoil, and would be an option that the UK Government could introduce to improve their current package of support.We also have a responsibility, and opportunity, to build bridges to a better economy and social contract for the future, one which can offer enhanced resilience for future shocks. A basic income could be a foundational policy for this new context. It is not a panacea or silver bullet and will not solve every problem in itself. However, it does offer a chance to create a new base for the social contract, one which values iniduals in their own right rather than on the extent of their economic activity.Now is the time to explore ideas once considered too radical, and to create a new normal rooted in security and opportunity, so that all our people can not just survive, but thrive.Jamie Cooke is head of RSA Scotland @JamieACooke"},{"url":null,"title":"comment-world-raised-glass-whisky-even-lockdown","story":"Day ndash but because of lockdownit was a very dferent occasion to normal.

Forcing MPs to choose between the safety of our communities and equal representation is unacceptable.“Parliament must be a forum where every part of the United Kingdom can participate equally. The Secretary of State knows this better than most and the challenges posed to communities that are more distant from parliament. We are calling on him to be a voice for equal representation in government.”Mr Jack was questioned on the issue in parliament yesterday, by SNP MP Allan Dorans. Mr Jack said: #Members of Parliament are key workers. More importantly, as a cabinet minister and a secretary of state, it is right that I should be here in the chamber so that I can be properly scrutinised and answer these questions.#I came down at the weekend and travelled on a train very safely. I willsafely and I will be isolating myself when I do, but that is solely because I go back to family. I do not see why we cannot have proper scrutiny of parliament when we have the virtual proceedings, which work for some, but for me it is absolutely about being here, being scrutinised and being at the Dispatch Box.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Signicant adjustments will also be required across our public transport services as the lockdown is eased in the coming weeks and months and the safety of the travelling public is hugely important.“The committee wants to hear about the experiences of iniduals and businesses and whether they feel they have received the support they need to survive and recover from this crisis.“We also want to learn about examples of good practice as we consider what lessons can be learned about the response to the pandemic and also how existing practices may need to change as we move forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also understandable that Ministers want safeguards in place to ensure that public funds are being allocated appropriately.“However, it is clear that requiring applicants to evidence use of a business bank account is causing real problems for many small businesses in the tourism sector.  Many were advised by their own banks to use personal bank accounts to run their operations. Having taken that advice, many now find it is denying them access to the support they desperately need.“BB owners are the backbone of an already vulnerable tourism sector in Orkney and, like other businesses, are facing an uphill challenge at this time. Yet, it is almost asthey haven’t been considered to be a viable business at all, which is deeply frustrating.“I have been raising this issue with the Finance Secretary for a number of weeks now and was encouraged by Kate Forbes’ recognition of the problem and her willingness to keep looking at how this gap in support might be closed. So far, Ministers have been willing to widen criteria and make improvements to funds where needed. I hope the same can happen in this instance so that the hardship fund can continue to target support at those businesses that it was designed to help.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process. Having played a lead role in securing the transfer of Wrightbus, which faced liquidation, to the Bamford group we are determined to bring as many jobs as possible to Ballymena as a result”, Mr Brash concluded.

The headache was unreal. When it started coming on the news about the coronavirus and there was a list of the symptoms, it made me think. I#m convinced that it was coronavirus. I#ve never been as sick.Though many people are convinced they may have had coronavirus, medical experts disagree. Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Associationand a GP in Londonderry, says he is convinced that the bug making people sick before Christmas was a dferent virus.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it Dr Tom Black, British Medical AssociationThere certainly was a viral illness in December and January, he says. But it wouldn#t have been consistent with what we then found with the Covid virus. From a patient#s point of view you would have got a sore throat, a temperature, felt unwell, some vomiting and diarrhoea as well. So I suppose there are some similarities but that is because they are both viral illnesses. We certainly didn#t see the level of very severe respiratory symptoms that we then saw with Covid.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it.Dr Black says that he disagrees with suggestions that December#s widespread illness was in fact the first wave of coronavirus and that we have just left the deadly second wave.Our microbiology colleagues are very clear about when the infection came and when they were able to pick it up on their very accurate tests, he says. I think we are still in the first wave. The severity of Covid was markedly dferent from a standard flu. It is a much more severe illness in a minority and we didn#t see those patients until we were in the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern IrelandAnd Dr Black says, although there are less patients presenting to our hospitals, the virus is still out there. We have fewer cases appearing into general practice. We have fewer cases coming into the Covid centres that the GPs man and we have fewer cases in hospital and in ICU. So in all four areas we have reduced numbers of cases, he says. It#s not gone yet, it#s still endemic in the community. There seems to be a concentration in two places - in care homes and among health care workers. So we are going to have start increasing our testing of patients and staff in care homes, which has been announced by the minister. And we are going to have to increase our testing among health care workers.As for how many of us might have acquired herd immunity, Dr Black also estimates the numbers are still very low, saying that just % of the Northern Irish population might have had the virus already.

Connection allows the virus to enter the cell using viral RNA, and that is the most important part of the virus. It effectively acts like a photocopier.RNA manages how the other parts of the cell . When the virus RNA gets into the cell, it reassigns everything to one job - make more virus particles.Instead of the cell doing things to keep our bodies working efficiently, it focuses on making viruses. One gets in, thousands of virus particles come out. They infect other cells, and eventually other people. That process happens over and over again, and very suddenly - in just a few weeks - you have a global pandemic.No one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wandThe human immune system reacts to defend the body, but for some people the immune system is overwhelmed. Overactive, it causes damage to tissue and organs. Lungs may be unable to operate. The weaker the immune system in a person, the more likely serious damage is caused, hence the shielding of those most vulnerable in our society.A lot of the drugs - antivirals - being trialled and tested across the world are trying to stop this viral replication.A vaccine is seen as the game-changer, the route back to the world we knew.Vaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from diseases.Having a vaccine also benefits the whole community through herd immunity.If enough people are vaccinated, it is harder for the disease to spread to those people who cannot have vaccines.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Anthony FauciAFP via Getty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Anthony FauciAnthony Fauci, the face of America#s fight against coronavirus, believes a vaccine may be ready in  to  months.It sounds a long time, but history shows it really isn#t.Fauci#s timeline would shatter all precedents for developing a new vaccine, which can take many years. The fastest vaccine was for mumps, and took four years.Optimism about an Aids vaccine was once high, but  years later we still wait.Dr Power added: Unfortunately, no one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wand and suddenly saying there#s your vaccine. It#s a much more complicated process than that.There are around  vaccines in clinic at the minute, most of them targeting the #spike# protein, which latches itself on to the cells.If that can be nulled then the virus can#t latch onto the cells and cannot become active and infect.But there#s no one definitive process on how to develop the vaccine in the first place, and that#s before you get to the testing stage.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:Opinion Selfish party-goers will en the time coronavirus lockdown restrictions remain for all of us in Northern IrelandSome of the candidate vaccines involve hugely weakening the virus, before putting it into the body. The idea is to stimulate the immune system to create enough of the right type of antibodies to be ready to fight the real thing. Others involve finding a way to get a virus particle that our systems can easily fight off, and get that to carry the spike protein from SARS-CoV, the virus that causes Covid-. The idea being our cells which make antibodies will learn to recognise the shape of the spike protein, and be ready to stop it entering the ACE- receptorwhen it arrives on the real virus particle. At Oxford University Irish Professor Adrian Hill is heading a team using this method, the current leaders in the race to develop a vaccine to stop the virus.And a final truly modern method is being worked on by several companies, including US-based Moderna. It involves cutting up the RNA of the virus, effectively clipping up the page before it is put into the photocopier. The aim of this is to isolate the bit of the virus RNA that makes the spike protein, and get that into our cells. Our cell machinery will then #photocopy# the spike protein, but never see the rest of the virus particle. Those spikes will be recognised by the immune system, which will make antibodies, ready for a time when the spikes arrive on the virus particle. These are known as RNA vaccines, and many experts believe they will be key to fighting infectious diseases in the years to come, but the technology to produce them has only become viable in the last few years, and none have yet been rolled out. You must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage.Once approved, they would be very quick to produce, but testing of such designs - and all designs - would be crucial. Dr Power explained: It#s very dficult to say what the best method is and the construction of the vaccine is critical.And we have to remember our primary targets are the elderly and they are much more dficult to vaccinate than younger people as their immune system is weaker.But once the method of production of the virus is settled, the next step is to scale up to a level where you can produce millions of doses.Then it#s a case of repetitive testing through several phases, with safety the main issue throughout the whole process.With pre-clinic trials, perhaps involving mice, you allow the virus effect to be minimal but we can determine the capability of immune response toxicity levels, whether the vaccine does too much damage to be useful.If the vaccine gets through that stage, then it is on to testing in a clinic. But, as Dr Power explains, many hurdles still lie ahead.He added: Safety is again the key, making sure there are no problems caused, watching the consequences and toxicity levels. Any signs of toxicity and a decision will have to be made on whether to progress to the next phase.That#s when you introduce the vaccine to a series of trials with a limited number of subjects, again ensuring safety all the way through. You look for dose effects, how much of the potential vaccine produces the best results. Then you select the dose to proceed with to another stage.Using a much greater number of people, perhaps thousands, there must be a robust response. If everything comes together and the vaccine still produces positive results then the steps to authorise can start. A decision will be made whether to manufacture or not and all the details in the dossier will be looked at before a licence to produce is granted.By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.It all sounds like a lot of work, and it is.With this pandemic there is a lot more pressure to produce and there#s a temptation to relax a little in terms of vigilance, said Dr Power.But you must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage. Normally the whole process takes around  years.I spent nine years working on a vaccine and it fell at the third stage. It#s not easy, there#s a lot that can go wrong. And eventhe vaccine does work, can we be sure it will still work in a year#s time You normally need at least a year to monitor that, take time to draw breath and then move to the next step. If there#s anything viable within the next  months we#re talking about history book stuff. By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.There can then still be issueany vaccine is brought to market, Dr Power explains.Read More This has been #worst event to hit us in  years, even after two recessions,# says NI business ownerProblems can develop, a one in a million reaction can be missed.He added: It#s wonderful to see the aspiration to produce a vaccine for Covid-, but the pressure of your country is not what you want on your shoulders, especiallythings go wrong down the line.We all want this so badly there#s a real danger of problems. We have to work out which specic people have a bad reaction - that#s normal with any vaccine.There#s a risk with everything and those risks will be found out in trying to gain approval to bring to market.The risks must be balanced. Those people who have a reaction will then not be given the vaccine and the theory is that herd immunity protects them. The virus struggles to find those without vaccination. The majority protect the few.He added: But in everything we do we can#t lose sight of the fact that we must always follow the data. That takes a considerable amount of time.

Dr O#Neill, joint chair of the West Belfast GP Federation, echoed the scientic adviser#s view that it will be prudent to plan for a second wave.No one knowsthere will be a second wave, but history tells us there is a probability, Dr O#Neill said, citing the Spanish Flu of , which first appeared early that year then ed in a brutal way in the autumn. If it happens, it will likely be in the winter during the #normal flu season, Dr O#Neill said, adding: It will be prudent to make preparations for the possibility.He added: Nobody knows for certain, but this is a novel virus and strange things are happening almost every day. It is best to be prepared and would be folly not. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Executive’s chief scientic adviser, Professor Ian Young FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Executive’s chief scientic adviser, Professor Ian YoungProfessor Young predicted that there will be a lower risk in the summer time as it is known the virus survives less well in the sunlight and outdoors. If exposed to ultraviolet light, the virus is destroyed within minutes, but can survive for between  and  hours on hard surfaces indoors, research shows.The scientic adviser added: There is still risk during that time and as we get into the autumn and winter where people are spending more time indoors, they are closer together, there is not so much sunlight and we have the normal flu season then all of those things add together and certainly increases the risk... and that is definitely something people are thinking about and considering in planning.The advice at this stage is against indoor visits of family members, but the government is allowing family members to meet outdoors.The indoor visits are a signicantly higher level of risk than the outdoor visits, which we are encouraging and the Executive has permitted at the moment, Professor Young said.In terms of indoor activities or business, visits to close family members while maintaining social distancing and being very careful with cleaning surfaces are at the low risk of the spectrum... but right now, they are a step too far, the adviser said, adding that he is urging people to keep those visits outdoors.Professor Young added that his team and others are working on the basis of the R, or reproduction number. It currently sits at approximately ., which reveals how many people are infected by any one inidual.We need to make sure that R stays below one and for us to be certain about that typically takes about two or three weeks , he said. The R number has not changed in any signicant way over the last number of days.When the R number is under one, then the epidemic is under control, Prof Young added, The R number is calculated by crunching data from several weeks, including the number of new cases per day, patients admitted to hospital, those who need critical care treatment, outbreaks in care homes and the number of deaths.

The advice for these people to shield remains in place.This advice is there to protect vulnerable iniduals and keep them safe.This situation won#t last forever. The advice for those shielding will be updated before the  weeks is up and people will be kept updated about what that means for them.Can I travel a distance to meet people outdoors while observing social distancing The changes to the restrictions mean that up to six people who aren#t members of the same household can meet outdoors, while observing social distancing.While you are permitted to travel to do so, people are urged to be sensible, stay localpossible and limit the numbers of journeys you are making.Can I travel for exercise People are permitted to travel to take exercise, but anyone doing so is urged to please be responsible. Don#t travel too far and avoid travelling to places where there are likely to be lots of people where it will be dficult to maintain social distancing.Can I travel on public transport to visit someone outdoors The use of public transport to visit someone outdoors is permitted. But anyone doing so must observe the social distancing measures in place on public transport and observe good hygiene.Those using public transport should also consider using a face covering. And it would be a good idea to avoid peak periods, especially times when key workers are likely to be trying to travel to and from work.Do the relaxations apply to meI#m over   Do the relaxations apply to meI#m pregnant The relaxations apply to everyone, except those who have received a shielding letter. Anyone who has received such a letter should continue to shield.Those aged over , and pregnant women, are considered to be more vulnerable and are advised to be particularly careful about following social distancing guidance and good hygiene. People should follow the public health advice and not put themselves at any increased risk.Can I meet people from other households indoorswe#re very careful with social distancing People who are not from the same household should not meet indoors at this time. The current expert advice is that meeting indoors is still too risky for now. It is recognised that this is an important issue for many people and the situation will be kept under review.Can I go to stay in a caravan People are still not permitted to leave their homes to stay in caravans.

DC Tours is also ramping up marketing of its online tour to colleges, schools and study groups - as current lockdown and travel ban has temporarily shuttered its in-person business.The company is not only targeting those interested in modern Irish history, but also psychology, English language and political geography, among others, said Mark Wylie, who co-founded the company seven years ago.In response to the coronavirus shutdown, DC Tours developed the just over two-hour online experience that includes a tour and a question and answer session with travel guide, Paul #Donzo# Donnelly, also a founder of the company.It has been running now for two weeks with tours on Saturday and Sunday evenings. The tour has attracted visitors from the UK, Ireland and the US, which reflects the demographics of the #in person# walks, Mr Wylie said, adding that those that supported the company through crowd funding in recent weeks were invited to join.The shutdown has focused the minds of those in the company to think dferently, and they are now sending messages out to schools and universities, including those the company had a relationship with previously, the company founder said.It is a fantastic opportunity for the education market, schools, universities, study tours, said Mr Wylie. The idea was there beforehand...butdid not realise the opportunity.The company recognises that the virus will have a long-term effect, even when the lockdown is eased considerably. It may be not possible to host walking tours with  to  people for some time, the DC Tours owner said.From the start of the crisis we have been determined to find a way to keep the company going while keeping our guests and guides safe, said Mr Wylie, who added that the company is grateful for the crowdfunding support from guests who wanted us to get through this because they loved the tour so much.They gave us the vital support we needed to re-imagine the business and create something completely new and unique to Belfast, said Mr Wylie.That support allowed us to spend some time thinking about the sort of experience of Belfast we might be able to offer people in the current climate, he added. And so we did our research and created a brand new #virtual tour# where guests who can#t make it to Belfast this year can still learn about our city#s history from a local. The result is #The History of the Troubles# which launched a few weeks ago and is already proving to be a big hit, with its first dates selling out within hours.On post shut-down, Mr Wylie said: Evenwe can only run smaller tours, we still believe there is a good local audience - people who want to find out more about their own history, or those with children who are studying the conflict as part of their history or politics curriculum.

Unfortunately, Guy has asked we pass on this.” ‘Guy’ is Guy Pearce, a British-Australian actor, musician and singer-songwriter and crucially, a man who made a guest appearance at Slaughtneil disco back in . While no reason is given for him deciding to pass on our offer to relive the memories, there is a good chance the trip in Sean McGuigan’s silver Renault  may have something to do with it. “I picked him up in Maghera town – I don’t know who got him there, but that’s where I lted him,” says the current club chairperson. googletag.cmd.push “We were going out the road and it just got immediately dark. It scared the wits out of the poor fella. He said, ‘Jesus mate, where are we going to ’. “The poor fella thought he was getting hijacked, but he went in and did all he needed to do.” Pearce was nearing the end of a three-year stint as ‘Mike Young’ in Australian sitcom ‘Neighbours’ after making his acting debut on the show in . Terry McIl was DJ at the time of Pearce’s visit and recalled how hordes of frenzied teenagers packed Slaughtneil hall to the rafters for a glimpse of the star. googletag.cmd.push “There were , people there the night Guy Pearce came. There was even a marquee at the side of Slaughtneil that night as well as the hall being packed.” he said. “They just came up with this idea that they were going to get Guy Pearce. I had to go and buy myself a radio mic for it. He was civil, a nice fella. “He was good with the people, chatty and friendly. Even with the photographs we have, the stage was packed because everyone was up to get autographs and that kind of thing.”  Among those who had made their way to Slaughtneil with fancy notions of chatting to the Neighbours star were three girls who ended up getting closer than they had bargained for. The rush to the front caused a bit of a crush, and amid the screaming and the heat, a few of the girls who were closest fainted. They were hastily dragged onto the stage by the bouncers. Cathy Rennie was one of those who were lted out of the crowd and said she was sure to make the best of a bad situation. “I don’t know how I got up near the front, to tell you the truth,” said the Dungiven woman. “I don’t even know what he was doing on the stage, whether he was singing or anything, but I just felt myself getting all faint. “The next thing there was somebody lting me. Two bouncers lted me up onto the stage and it was near where he was at. He just looked round and smiled at me and I touched his hand. “I think he had on a black leather jacket and I just grabbed him. It’s a wonder he didn’t take me for assault! “Then I was took to the back of the stage and there were a couple of girls sitting there who had fainted too. We had the best seats in the house.” Cathy recalls how the build-up to the event had reached fever pitch during the week when the details were finally confirmed in the local newspaper. “Momentum was building up all week at school that he was coming to Slaughtneil. I’m almost sure it was confirmed in the Mid Ulster Observer,” she said. “For him to come to Slaughtneil after us watching him on the TV was amazing. Neighbours was the main thing. It was on every day at five o’clock and you rushed home from school to watch it. “The whole thing was unreal, the excitement of ‘imagine you got talking to him’. It was the first time any of us had ever been somewhere there was a star. “We would never have experienced that before, apart from maybe Daniel O’Donnell or Barry McGuigan at the Castle. “I remember Barry McGuigan coming after he was the champion, the Clones Cyclone, and that was a big thing in Dungiven years ago, but Guy Pearce was after that. “It’s not like young ones nowadays who can go to a concert and see Westle, or Girls Aloud or One Direction or whatever. We never had anything like that in our lives. “When I think of Slaughtneil, I always think of that night. It was just class.” The teenagers of south Derry spent over  years filing into Slaughtneil hall, but, for many, the first occasion that springs to mind is that night in ’. Guy Pearce has gone on to have a successful career on both the screen and the stage, and the , who crammed into Slaughtneil hall will claim some credit for sending him on his way.

We had the best seats in the house.” Cathy recalls how the build-up to the event had reached fever pitch during the week when the details were finally confirmed in the local newspaper. “Momentum was building up all week at school that he was coming to Slaughtneil. I’m almost sure it was confirmed in the Mid Ulster Observer,” she said. “For him to come to Slaughtneil after us watching him on the TV was amazing. Neighbours was the main thing. It was on every day at five o’clock and you rushed home from school to watch it. “The whole thing was unreal, the excitement of ‘imagine you got talking to him’. It was the first time any of us had ever been somewhere there was a star. “We would never have experienced that before, apart from maybe Daniel O’Donnell or Barry McGuigan at the Castle. “I remember Barry McGuigan coming after he was the champion, the Clones Cyclone, and that was a big thing in Dungiven years ago, but Guy Pearce was after that. “It’s not like young ones nowadays who can go to a concert and see Westle, or Girls Aloud or One Direction or whatever. We never had anything like that in our lives. “When I think of Slaughtneil, I always think of that night. It was just class.” The teenagers of south Derry spent over  years filing into Slaughtneil hall, but, for many, the first occasion that springs to mind is that night in ’. Guy Pearce has gone on to have a successful career on both the screen and the stage, and the , who crammed into Slaughtneil hall will claim some credit for sending him on his way.

Shrouded in darkness on a Friday evening, its charms were not easily advertised, butthe mountain would not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain. But how would south Derry’s teenage prophets get there  “Putting on the Ulsterbuses and all the coaches is what really got it going. They came in fairly quickly and it did the trick,” said current club chairperson Sean McGuigan. “Darragh’s and McLaughlin’s only had maybe four buses and they were a wee bit reluctant to send good buses to the disco. Ulsterbus were a great saviour.” googletag.cmd.push Every Friday evening, a group of hardy bus drivers would set off from towns across Derry, delivering the county’s youth to Slaughtneil hall. It wasn’t for everyone. Pat McGlade, who drove the Draperstown bus for a brief period as the disco was drawing to a close, beat a hasty exit. “I was never at Slaughtneil in my le, I didn’t even know where it was at, but the first night I landed, we got them off and the fighting started,” he said. “I said, ‘JesusI get out of here tonight, I’ll not be back!’. I’d never seen the like of it – they were killing each other that night!” googletag.cmd.push His predecessor, Loup man Sean Glendinning, approached the journey with a little more relish. “They all called me Big Sean for some reason. I wasn’t that big, but I would have gave an odd roar out of me and they sort of listened to me!” he said. “I got on well with them, really. You can’t put old heads on young bodies. You have to be flexible, andyou work with young people, they’ll work with you. “We had no real hassle on the bus, the young people were easy talked to. I gave them a bit of space and they knew how far they could go with you. I never had any hassle. “You’d have got a bit of fighting, but you never passed any remarks on it. It wasn’t too bad, just a bit of a row. “I used to tell the young boys thatthey wanted to box, to go and do it in the ring and earn a bit of money. “The worst bit was whenever the snow was on, you got a bit of a snowballing! There was many a hairy night about it now, but we made it, we got there.” Every night the fleet of drivers was ushered into the club’s kitchen and were wined and dined in traditional GAA style, with plenty of sandwiches, tea and biscuits to be had. “We were well looked after up there,” said Sean. “Once you got there, they took you into the club and Willie Hampson was the main man. You got your tea and all the drivers got a fiver. “You had men from everywhere. The Ulsterbuses came from Kilrea and Dungiven and you had men from all round. Good times and good chat. There was the odd lie told! “The kettle was going and there would be biscuits and a bit of craic. There were four or five in at one time and one or two would have stayed out to keep an eye on the buses.” Willie Hampson is held in high esteem by all the drivers and his hospitality on a Friday night is remembered fondly when they recall the disco. “Willie Hampson looked after the bus drivers and he was some man,” said Colm McGuigan, who started driving the Dungiven bus around . “He used to try and give us all a fiver, but we would have left it all and split it at Christmas time. I would say Slaughtneil got me through twelve Christmases when the weans were young!”  Colm is the current Derry GAA kit man and never tires of reminding the Slaughtneil players of his role in their success. “I used to slag the Slaughtneil men when they came on the Derry team that it was me built their club, bringing all the weans over,” he said. An Ulsterbus employee, he did the school runs by day from Limavady depot, and it was after some pestering from a few of the pupils that the routes to Slaughtneil expanded. “When I started, it was only Dungiven going over to it. They would have gathered at the bus depot and two buses would have left,” said Colm. “A year or so into it, the school weans used to say ‘would you not put a bus on to Slaughtneil ’ “I was in Limavady depot at the time, so I talked to a few of the drivers and we said we’d book a bus ourselves in our own name.” Demand for the bus shot up as hordes of teenagers clamoured for a place every Friday night, but the Troubles still cast a shadow over South Derry in the s and s, and the chances of stumbling on a security checkpoint with an overloaded bus were high. “Some nights there were maybe  weans on the bus, but we were lucky, we were never stopped,” said Colm. “I remember we left Limavady during holiday time with about  in a -seater. Another  or  got on in Drumsurn, another  or  in Ballerin and by that time I was looking down the bus thinking ‘Jesus, how many is in this thing ’ “When I got theof Glenullin, there were  weans standing and I was thinking ‘what am I going to do here ’ “I put the  weans on anyway and they were up in the racks and everywhere, so I said to myself I couldn’t go down onto the main road with these weans. “I had to put the bus into first gear to get it over the top of that hill past the Gaelic pitch and I took it over the back roads into Slaughtneil. “I came back that way and once I got those weans left off in Glenullin, I was happy enough to go down onto the main road again after that!” In order to reduce the potential for mischief on the buses, the GAA club provided bouncers who would travel on the bus with the drivers. Colm generally preferred to police the bus himself and recalls one night in particular when support came from an unlikely corner. “One night I couldn’t get a driver, so I had to drive it myself. This boy got on with a bag of drink,” he said. “Usually you weren’t allowed it, they just poured it down the drain, but this boy was a bit older than the rest of them and had a bag, so I took it off him and told him he’d get it after. “I put it in around the cab. He behaved badly on the way over and I warned him a few times, so coming back again I said, ‘you behave yourself til we get home.’ “He didn’t do so bad until we got theof Drumsurn and he went clean mad again, wrecking and tearing at the back of the bus. “We got to Limavady and he came to me and said, ‘I want my drink’ and I said ‘you’re not getting it, you didn’t behave yourself.’ “He drew out and he hit me and knocked the glasses off me. He had long hair and I managed to grab him, and the next thing was he landed out onto the street. “I looked and the police were sitting in the Landrover. I could see them coming and I thought ‘Jesus I’m in bother.’ “He got up and ran and the policemen chased him. The two cops came down then and askedI was alright andI wanted to press charges. “I said ‘naw you’re alright’ and they said, ‘you did a brave job with him anyway’ and I never heard another word about it.” Despite the odd bit of trouble here and there, Colm is full of praise for the Slaughtneil clubmen who kept things under control. “All the boys that were looking after the disco were pioneers. They were great clubmen and they were never short,” he said. “Even when the younger boys that were going to the disco in the early days, when they got past it they were doing their bit at it too. “It gave them a serious name in those early days, and it put a bit of a push on the other clubs about the county to make their club as financially strong as Slaughtneil.” With his parents’ house being in Maghera, Colm was able to take advantage by dropping in for a visit while the hundreds of teenagers he transported were dancing just a few miles out the road. “Every Friday night I would have reversed the bus up to the side of the house and watched The Late, Late Show with my mother and father,” he said. “You had to rush back to get up before the parents came up in cars. It would take you  or  minutes to get out, but it was well-marshalled and it was a good time for the weans.” The bus drivers who braved the roads leading to Slaughtneil disco kept teenagers dancing in the South Derry hills. They became the trustworthy ferrymen of teenage dreams.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil disco. The Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. googletag.cmd.push “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. googletag.cmd.push “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us. “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Brian Mullins was at the helm when the Anglo Celt Cup last ed to the Oakleaf County in  and Michael McMullan spoke to him about his three years in charge. Reigning champions Dublin led the  All-Ireland semi-final by four points when a loose ball plodded around the middle of Croke Park. Brian Mullins ghosted from behind a ruck. He pulled on the ball with a measured conviction. The Dublin midfielders dink hovered towards Pat Gogarty, under the shadow of the Hogan Stand. His diagonal pass found the unmarked Tony Hanahoe with the Canal End goal in his sights. After dodging two token Derry tackles, Hanahoe roofed the ball unceremoniously to the top corner. John Sommers didnt have a prayer. googletag.cmd.push It was Mullins first taste of Derry. Anthony McGurk was in the opposing corner, on a team managed by the late Frankie Kearney. The three men would unite  years later to take charge of a turbulent Oakleaf ship, following the sacking of Eamonn Coleman and the player strikes that followed Mickey Morans appointment in . Brian tiptoed onto the management circuit, like he did into Dublins team of the seventies. As an -year-old, a son of Kerry and Clare parents, he was selling programmes at the  All-Ireland final, before being called in by supremo Kevin Heffernan the following season, by chance almost. googletag.cmd.push In a bid to bolster his midfield options, Heffo got tipped off about an upcoming Fran Ryder and headed to Belfast for a Thomond Colleges Sigerson Cup clash against the Ranch. It was, however, Ryders colleague and the managers clubmate Mullins who caught the eye. He brought his selectors to watch Brian in action for St Vincents in an U championship clash, where he battered through the opposition defence before scoring a last gasp winning goal. That was it, Mullins was in. There was still a hiccup and he almost missed the All-Ireland final win over Galway. A chipped bone in his foot, sustained in Dublin U action, had Mullins laid up in the Mater hospital, with less than a month to the September showpiece. Heffernan and the chief surgeon had a dference of opinion on Mullins fitness, before the Dubs boss got his way. “A decade in medical school didnt please Kevin,” commented Dublin player Dr Pat ONeill, who was also working in the Mater at the time, in Tom Humphries Dublin v Kerry book. Mullins secured the first of four Celtic Crosses, matching his uncle Bill Casey of Kerry. His career also saw him lose five further finals – all to the Kingdom – and coast to club All-Ireland glory. Heffo, according to Mullins, was a big influence on their squad during that era. “I would have learned a lot from him and hopefully carried those lessons into my own operation,” he offers. “I have been lucky during my late teens and early s...I picked up a lot of what he was about.” In the summer of , Mullins career and le flashed before him in a car crash, on his way from a holiday in Wexford to training in Dublin. He broke his leg and suffered severe head injuries. A testament to his toughness was shaking off a career-threatening injury, thanks to help from Irish Olympian Eamon Coghlan. Mullins restored the muscle in his legs and played in a further three All-Ireland finals, winning one in , a game where he was one of three Dublin players dismissed. Brian was made captain for the  season, but could only look on as Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute delivered a rousing acceptance speech as Gaeilgeafter lting the Sam. It was his last time in the Dublin jersey and when Kevin Heffernan stepped away, he joined Sean Doherty and Robbie Kelleher as a three-man management team to succeed him. Mullins, currently the Director of Sport at UCD, was a qualied PE Teacher from University of Limerick, but never felt management would be something he would have tried his hand at. The trio left the post after a defeat by an emerging Meath team. “There were many other things going on in my le, between owning a business and teaching. Then I moved to Donegal in ,” Mullins points out. He had been running a fitness centre business with another Vins man, Mickey Whelan, he was playing with the club and teaching in Dublin. Mullins was appointed as Principal of Carndonagh Community School, where he lived for nine years and played a bit of club football for the local club. “It was the biggest school in Ireland,” he says. “The school used to compete in all levels at Ulster Schools competitions. There were clubs in all the town on the peninsula, there was a big catchment area.” His next county involvement would come from an unlikely corner. *** He cant put it down to an exact moment, when Derry came calling. Mullins was now rooted in Donegal and managing all aspects of school le was all-consuming. “When the Derry opportunity came up in , it wasnt something I was necessarily thinking of doing,” he recalls. “Managing a county team is something I wasnt preoccupied with,” he added, before giving it some consideration. “I ended up doing the job for three years,” Mullins added. “The squad was already in place, which included most,not all of the All-Ireland squad of .” Brian McGilligan and Tony Scullion would step away during his tenure, with Danny Quinn later taking on a coaching role after helping Harry Gribbinwith the U team. Enda Gormley did begin the   as a trainer. He felt a lethargy, which later transpired to be a blood problem. Once it cleared, Mullins coaxed Enda back to the playing . In the early days, Eugene Young trained the team, with Frankie Kearney and Anthony McGurk as selectors. “Anthony lived in Derry City, so I got in touch with him,” Mullins points out. “We were about the same age. I knew he had been heavily involved with Lavey and thatJohnny was playing. “I wouldnt have spoken to Anthony for  years before I got in contact. I wouldnt necessarily have kept in contact with players I had played against.” With his appointment two or three weeks before the start of the league, Mullins hadnt attended the club championship, having still been playing in Donegal with Carndonagh that summer. “Training went well all through the league. The players enjoyed the games and particularly the win over Donegal in the final,” came his early memories of his first season. Did he feel retaining the league title was a priority  “They had ambition,” he said of the squad. “They wanted to do well and they wanted to win the league in . It was indicative of their ability and their motivation to try and follow on from . “Some of them felt they took their eye off the ball in  and  and they wanted to pick up again.” During our phone conversation, Mullins comes across as a thinker. Every sentence is calm, to the point and absent of background noise. “Fergal McCusker, Anthony Tohill, Henryand Kieran McKeever were there and any amount of them were in their mid-s and felt they had a lot of football in them,” he adds. Reflecting on the litany of names, and with hindsight, winning the league was no surprise. The championship was a dferent kettle of fish he states. After a facile win over Armagh at home, they bowed out to Tyrone in Clones. “The wheels came off...from the high of winning the league final, to two months later being out of the championship and your effort to win an All-Ireland - which is what most teams set out for - was derailed.” Only the front door was in vogue back then, it was another year away from Sam and Derry were no closer. Mullins felt there were no mental scars from a second defeat to their rivals in as many years. “There is no dficulty when you are at that level,” Mullins points out, with a firm tone of voice. “You dont dwell on defeats...apart from aspects you can learn from. It is another effort and another year of doing better than the previous year.” After the  championship defeat, to Tyrones  men, Mullins went at the league in his first season with conviction. Restoring the winning habit was important. “There was some thinking that we peaked too early. In , we tried to put more into the championship.” They didnt qualy for the latter stages of the league and it took a comfortable replay win to see off Monaghan in the first round, to set up Derry versus Tyrone – for the third year in a row. Noel Donnelly thumped home an early goal but it was a  dawn. Joe Cassidy and Joe Brolly notched - between them, with the latter blowing kisses after he slid home his goal and Seamus Downey grabbed a second goal in a hammering of sorts. “We fell foul of Cavan in the final,” Mullins remembers. “In some ways, we thought we got some things right but, on the day, Cavan...they were that little bit ahead of us in terms of delivering on the pitch. We didnt do it.” Jason Reilly did a Ravenelli by pulling his jersey over his head in celebration to mark his th minute goal. Cavan were now ahead. Seconds later Gary McGill had the goal chance, but his shot went straight at goalkeeper Paul ODowd. In the end, Cavan prevailed by the narrowest of margins. Controversy surrounded the victory. They were given a point in the first half that should never have stood. Raymond Cunninghams shot went a foot to the right of the posts. It was something Mullins, surprisingly, didnt and doesnt buy into. “When you are on the sideline and you are involved in a match -the umpire puts up his flag and the referee tots it as a score, thats it, it is a point. “I dont dwell on it. You dwell on the fact you were beaten by a point and wonder where you might have missed scores yourself. “There was a point on the scoreboard, the record shows that and that wouldve been our view coming out of it. On any given day, anything can happen with the opposition that puts them that little bit ahead. It is only learning what you didnt do or what you didnt do enough of, to make sure you made up for it in some way.” *** If Brian Mullins first season was a rushed start, going into  offered more time to scour the county for new players. Clubs were sounded out and recommendations were gathered of the young and emerging talent. “You went with the management team to matches,” he points out. “You looked to see who you could take into the . I am thinking of the likes of Enda Muldoon.” The Ballinderry man was one of six players from the U All-Ireland winning squad to come into the senior scene under the Dublin man. He had handed Sean Marty Lockhart his debut against Kerry at Ballinascreen in the Dublin mans first season. David ONeill and Paul McFlynn came into the defence for , with Joe Cassidy up front and Johnny McBride playing in a number of roles across the middle third. “We would go into each year believing thatwe did all we could and put our best foot forward, the Derry squad would believe they were equal to or better than most in Ulster and , was no dferent” Mullins outlined of this third season. “We were beat by Tyrone in  and by Cavan in , by a very close score, so going into  – why wouldnt you believe. We were happy enough where we were.” Derry lost the league final to Offaly, before hitting three goals in a double scores win over Monaghan in the championship. A semi-final win over Armagh took Derry through to another final, this time a low-scoring scrap with Donegal. “It was fine margins and we were close to losing again in  but we managed to get over the line,” came Mullins initial thoughts of the game. Captain Kieran McKeever didnt give Manus Boyle a snf and Lockharts masterclass on Tony Boyle put him on his way to an all-star later in the year. Even with a man of the match performance from wing-back Paul McFlynn, it looked like a game that was going to squirm away from Derry once again. With  seconds of stoppage time gone and the sides level, McFlynn pounced on a shanked Eoin McCloskey kick-out. As the Loup man scrambled on the ground, Anthony Tohill came in support, before drilling a thunderous delivery over midfield. Substitute Geoffrey McGonigle gained possession. With two Donegal defenders converging, Geoff flicked the ball across to Joe Brolly, who sidestepped Tony Blake before finishing the winning goal. “The fact that Geoffrey was involved in the goal makes it look like a good a decision,” Mullins ponders. “But these things can be seen as going horribly wrong and they can go right.” He was only on the pitch five minutes, but it wasnt a premeditated substitution. “In any circumstances, when you pick your starting , a lot of the time you have subs and decisions to have them as subs or in the starting  is a narrow decision. “We knew Geoffrey had the ability and he wouldve been very close to starting the game and putting him in, we were hopeful and knew he was capable of making a contribution – its as simple as that.” In the semi-final, Derry were convincingly beaten by a Galway team who would again beat them at the penultimate stage in . “That was the end of my three years,” Mullins conceded, while heaping praise on the players, the board and the GAA families during his three seasons. “It was about motivating the players, which wasnt a really dficult thing. They were a great bunch of lads and I would have nothing but praise for them. “That is the thing about sport, there is no guarantee that just because you put in a big effort you are going to end up winning. It is swings and roundabouts, you take the defeats on the chin and you head on into the rest of your le. “I just felt it was time for a change of voice and a change of energy and a change of direction,” he states of his decision to step down. “I had other things, in terms of my work and family, that I needed to put a priority on, and I felt the Derry job needed somebody dferent,” he concluded. Mullins still has family in north Donegal and would sometimes catch up with some of the Derry players of that era. He was in Moyola for Derrys golf day in , to mark  years since winning Sam. And  years on, Mullins remains the last manager to deliver championship silver. The wait continues. RELATED - Mullins surprised at Derrys -year gap without an Ulster title. More...

There is a wide range of financial support available to firms of all sizes. Today we take a look at how some companies have benefited from the help available. Furlough scheme ‘offers a leline to many businesses’  WORKING HARD: A Seating Matters employee producing medical equipment at the company’s workshop CASE STUDY PROTECTIVE GEAR A COUNTY Derry company has been protecting health care workers by supplying high-end protective gear for intensive care units during the COVID- crisis. Seating Matters, based outside Ballykelly, has been able to use the Government’s furlough scheme to protect about a quarter of its -strong workforce, while also helping provide box shields to protect healthcare workers while they are ventilating patients googletag.cmd.push The family-owned company has specialised in creating chairs to provide comfort, postural support, pressure management and improve quality of le for disabled adults and children since . During the COVID- outbreak, however, the company has teamed up with medical experts and designers to create the box shields. Managing director Martin Tierney said: “We have been making clinical therapeutic chairs for hospitals and we are very close to the front line in that respect because a lot of our chairs are being used in intensive care and in COVID wards.” Seating Matters was established by Martin’s mother Martina, an occupational therapist who had identied a global demand for therapeutic chairs. googletag.cmd.push It now has  staff but Mr Tierney said it had to furlough a quarter of its staff. He said the government furlough scheme was a leline for many businesses. Mr Tierney said: “I’m grateful that we can keep moving forward because there are a lot of places that are stopped altogether. I’m just grateful that we are not in that boat.” The firm has strict social distancing and changed an office entrance in order to safeguard staff against coronavirus infection. ‘Critical to Scouts’ survival’  HELPING HAND: Scouts Scotland supports , volunteers and , young people CASE STUDY SCOUTS SCOTLAND SCOUTS SCOTLAND chief executive Katie Docherty says the Coronavirus Job Retention Schemehas been absolutely critical to the survival of Scouts Scotland as an organisation. Almost  per cent of Scouts Scotland’s  staff have been furloughed as outdoor education centres and campsites have been closed and fundraising events have postponed due to the coronavirus lockdown. The organisation, which supports , volunteers and , young people in Scotland, has suffered a pound. million shortfall as a result. Ms Docherty said they had received some funding from the Scottish Government, but that furlough scheme is “the leline that’s keeping us going just now”. She said: “It’s the furlough scheme that’s allowed us to keep paying our staff whilst we have no income coming in. It’s been absolutely critical. We would have had to make most of our staff redundant otherwise.” The CJRS has been extended until the end of October by the UK Government in order to protect businesses and jobs across the country. Chancellor’s measures to safeguard firms and their staff  FINANCIAL HELP: Chancellor Rishi Sunak The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a range of measures for businesses and workers to protect them against the current economic emergency.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

Any timescale is a matter for the Executive following consultation with the Chief MedicalOfficerand Public Health Authority . Only when the Executive judges that conditionsare suitable and the key criteria to inform this judgement are presented within the Executive’s document, can sport resume. Initial focus will be on the sht from the current RED Phase to an AMBER phasewhen certain outdoor sports can start activity in small groups . Following any announcements from the Executive, sports will have a short period of notice before any easing in public health measures to initiate a move towards amber. googletag.cmd.push WATCH: Sport NIs Director of Performance Peter McCabeCLICK HERE... A risk assessment will need to be carried out, including numbers involved, social distancing andidentication of a safe space for isolation of an inidual should they become unwell and education will need provided to participants.  In time and when the Covid- outbreak is contained sufficiently, focus will sht on to step  which will be an extended YELLOW Phase when both outdoor and indoor sport activity would take place in larger groups, up to  people. The next progression would be to a GREEN phase which would lead to full training and competition across sports in line within general PHA guidelines that exist at the time, a re-opening of leisure centres and spectators able to attend live sporting events in restricted numbers. googletag.cmd.push Completion of each phase will represent a key milestone in the progression towards the resumption of sport and physical recreation in Northern Ireland. The time spent in each step may y, from a minimum of three weeks, butany of the criteria are met, this could stretch to six weeks, or more. Caution will be important at each step but especially during the AMBER phase which encompasses steps  and step  of the Executive’s Pathway to recovery. It provides for all sports, including outdoor recreation, from grassroots level to high performance sport andprofessional athletes. Sport NI recognises that there are dferent categories, to cover the range in a manner that is useful and applicable within Northern Ireland.  - Outdoor RecreationHill walking, orienteering, mountain biking, angling - Water sportsCanoeing, rowing, sailing, surfing, swimming - Non-ContactWeight-lting, golf, tennis, cricket, bowls, archery, cycling, athletics, equestrian, motorsports - Contact - lower risk Soccer, Gaelic football, camogie, hurling, hockey, netball, basketball - Contact - higher riskRugby, boxing, wrestling, karate - High Performance   Professional athletes Here is the pathway for contact lower risk sports below. The rest can be viewed via the link below  “It is vitally important that we emerge from lockdown in a managed, safe and consistent way and this Framework will help with this process,” commented Minister for Communities Deirdre Hargey. “I would urge the sports sector to use this Framework as they finalise their own protocols.” Also commenting was Antoinette McKeown, Sport NI CEO. “There is a huge appetite across sports athletes, coaches, fans and spectators toto sport and many sports are actively planning how to implement the first step on this pathway,” she said. “Sport NI’s Framework aims to facilitate that and acts as an important bridge between the NI Executive’s document and the more detailed protocols that sports will need to develop on an inidual basis.” She commended the sporting bodies for their response to Covid- and highlighted the role they still have to play. “Through responsible actions within each phase and at each of the five steps of the Executive’s pathway to recovery, all sport participants can play their part in gradually and safely transitioning NI towards a new type of normality.” The full document can be viewed here...

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Local charity volunteer Debbie Lamberton from Creggan has been writing since she was at school. Ive always done it over theyears topass the time she said. It keeps the brain active. I couldrhyme a poem off in a few minutes and other times I could sit for two or three days looking for a word that rhymes. I wont change the line until I get the right word. Debbies love of poetry blossomed in recentyears after she lost a number of loved ones to suicide. googletag.cmd.push I started really writing due to tragedy, she said. I lost a few people to the Foyle and I wrote a poem about it A River of Tears which people really connected with. That is my favourite poem and one that resonates this week because of Mental Health Awareness Week. Although some of her poetry deals with dficult themes, many of the pieces have a thread of humour running through them. Theres a sensehumourin Creggan, said Debbie. I write about things that everyone goes through and that everyone relates to and I put in it words that people relate to. googletag.cmd.push Theres no pointin me sitting here writing out a poem with big snobby words People will say shes from Creggan, who does she think she is, Shakespere  Poems like Lockdown make light of a bad situation because the one thing we do have is our humour. It doesnt mention the NHS though, so Id like todo something on that next. And Id also like to do a poem for our postmen because they are as much frontline workers as anyone. Debbie shares her poetry on Facebook and has been approached in the past about publishing a collection of her work. If I write something and someone relates to it then thats great, she said, If it lts someones spirits thats enoughfor me really. If I ever did write a book I would do it for charity because then it would combine two things that I love doing- fundraising and poetry. I also love to encourage other writers. I love to see people do well and Im a big believer thatyou can compliment someone then you should and it will come back to you in some way. ------------------ Lockdown - by Debbie Lamberton Well never forget about LockdownWhere we baked cakes and scones In our homesDanced through Tic Toc videos and musicPlanted flowers, and bought garden gnomes.Entertainment was there in abundance.Our local singers visited all of our streetsThe Easter bunny also made an appearanceWaving to kids with some chocolate and treats.Everyone pulled together making sure no-one was lonely.Birthdays were treated with drive bys and balloons.Personally trainers went live with their sessions.Where you could train in your own living room.Sadly funerals where sadder than everOnly small numbers were allowed to attendSome families could not be with their loved onesNo goodbyes when that le came to an end.This has been a challenge for all of us out thereWe should be proud that weve made it this farRaise your glass to those who sadly arent with us.To those who still battle throughout this corona war.

The -acre estate, which includes the derelict Boom Hall, stretches across a large section of land close to the Foyle Bridge at Culmore. Appeals have been made in recent years for more to be done to preserve the famous hall which is such bad condition that the land around it has been secured off. The new company, which has charitable status, is called the Boomhall Trust. The organisation has been awarded a Project Viability Grant by the Architectural Heritage Fund to help them explore uses which could revive and sustain the historically signicant and challenging building. googletag.cmd.push Speaking earlier this year when the new organisation was launched, Boomhall Trust chairman, Jim Sammon, said the buildings and land on the site have been unused and ‘run down for the past  years’. “A restored Boomhall Estate will be a powerful statement of optimism and confidence in the future of the region, and send the strongest signal to everyone that five decades of decay are coming to an end in the North West,” he said. Mr Sammon said the Boomhall Estate is mostly owned by Derry City and Strabane District Council which has commissioned a conservation plan for the buildings and landscape. googletag.cmd.push He said the new company is consulting with the council on the options for the site. He added that the Department of Communities has also part-funded the Boomhall Trust to undertake an archaeological investigation of the site in partnership with the archaeology department of Queens University of Belfast. “Our intention is that Boomhall will remain in public ownership and generate resources for local communities to sustain themselves for generations to come,” said Mr Sammon.

The -acre estate, which includes the derelict Boom Hall, stretches across a large section of land close to the Foyle Bridge at Culmore. Appeals have been made in recent years for more to be done to preserve the famous hall which is such bad condition that the land around it has been secured off. The new company, which has charitable status, is called the Boomhall Trust. The organisation has been awarded a Project Viability Grant by the Architectural Heritage Fund to help them explore uses which could revive and sustain the historically signicant and challenging building. googletag.cmd.push Speaking earlier this year when the new organisation was launched, Boomhall Trust chairman, Jim Sammon, said the buildings and land on the site have been unused and ‘run down for the past  years’. “A restored Boomhall Estate will be a powerful statement of optimism and confidence in the future of the region, and send the strongest signal to everyone that five decades of decay are coming to an end in the North West,” he said. Mr Sammon said the Boomhall Estate is mostly owned by Derry City and Strabane District Council which has commissioned a conservation plan for the buildings and landscape. googletag.cmd.push He said the new company is consulting with the council on the options for the site. He added that the Department of Communities has also part-funded the Boomhall Trust to undertake an archaeological investigation of the site in partnership with the archaeology department of Queens University of Belfast. “Our intention is that Boomhall will remain in public ownership and generate resources for local communities to sustain themselves for generations to come,” said Mr Sammon.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games. We had to do all our own prep, there was a delay in starting as guests arrived late due to Storm Ciara and there was a lot of things that went wrong, like the power going off, that wasnrsquot shown, said Alex.ldquoI joked with the other two guys you can just put the effort into one dish and can make sure its absolutely perfect but Irsquove got two to doldquoThe profile of the programme and the scale of the guests and how well known they were made it feel more pressurised.Ten years ago, Alex moved on to Deanes in Belfast after the Bucks Head, where he was working when they first received the Michelin star under Derek Creagh. He later moved to work with Gordon Ramsay at Claridgersquos, followed by Petrus in London, then had a spell in New Zealand before moving closer to home to the Clf House Hotel in Waterford.There are great expectations on what Alex will do next in his career but he doesnrsquot feel that a change will happen so soon considering the impact of the coronavirus lockdown has had on restaurants.ldquoA lot of people have said to me that I should open my own restaurant, but the industry is in dire straits at the moment so itrsquos hard to know what will happen, said Alex. ldquoOf course, I have ideas of what I would like to do, but Michael gives me a  for what I want to do which I appreciate.

The six bag restriction includes paper, cardboard, cans, bottles and garden waste waste. No commercial waste is being accepted.Ratepayers are being asked to pre-sort waste before entering the recycling sites and no wood, bulky items of household waste such as old furniture, mattresses or electrical goods will be accepted at this time.Council officials say that only one person per vehicle should travel to the site, appealing to people queueing to get in to the local facilities to remain in their vehicles.Only cars, small vans and trailers with small loads will be allowed to use the sites, with access for vans restricted to those no more than .m high. No large vehicles, horse boxes, tractors or small tipper trucks will be allowed on any of the sites.In addition, visitors must practice social distancing, maintaining a two metre distance from staff and other visitors on site, use hand sanitiser and take direction from centre staff.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

Ben Lowry writes: \"Perhaps there is a cross-border determination in Ireland to be seen to be dferent to him\": Aaron Chown PA WireThat the island of Ireland has been less badly hit by the virus than the island of Great Britain, and so should move fastest out of lockdown.But insofar as we can say anything about the dferential spread of coronavirus, we can probably say that both sides of the border have been less badly hit than the larger island across the Irish Sea.Numerous medical and statistical experts have said that it is too early to make detailed comparisons about the spread of the virus between dferent nations. In fact, they say, it will be years before there is a detailed understanding of what has happened in each country.This is due to things such as dferent levels of testing, dferent methods of recording deaths and ying ways of collating the data. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Internationally, for example, Belgium is said to be worst for deaths in Europe partly because it is the most transparent and includes suspected deaths linked to Covid-.Even within the four home nations of the United Kingdom, there are dfering ways of measuring what is happening.None of this has stopped Irish nationalists and their expert apologists from incessantly comparing outcomes in the UK to the Republic of Ireland .Not only has the UK-Ireland comparison been made relentlessly, it was made six weeks ago when it was even more inappropriately early and prone to error.Yet while it is too soon to make detailed comparisons, broad trends have been apparent for weeks, showing that some countries are far more badly hit by Covid-, for reasons that are often unclear.One thing that has been stark is the discrepancy between England and the other parts of these islands.Yet this is not often mentioned, because the UK is considered a single unit for international counting comparisons.However,you think of a five-part British Isles, then England has far higher deaths per person than any of the other four parts.Deaths in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic are all set to end upsomewhere in the range of  to  fatalities per million people.Deaths in England will be +.At the moment the Republic of Irelandhas a slightly higher death toll than NI, but when care homes are added to the latter it might end up lower.Both RoI and NI are a bit behind Wales and Scotland, but not much.The are two plausible factors for the dferences.The first is population density.England is far more packed than the other four parts, with a massive  people per square kilometre.Wales is next,  per squ km.Then NI on  per squ km.This is almost twice as densely populated as the Republic of Ireland, and Scotland .If England was a nation state it would be one of the  most densely populated on Earth .Critics of the population density theory are right to say that the global spread of Covid- is much more complicated than population density. Some nations with the best outcomes are very densely populated, such as Taiwan and South Korea.But when you exclude a small number of competent nations that responded fast, such as those two and Germany, there is a striking correlation with population density. Netherlands and Belgium are badly hit by the virus, and Europe’s most densely populated countries.The most densely populated states of the US — New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, New York — are all at the top of the worst hit Covid states.The second plausible factor in the British Isles dferences is the two islands — that Covid- arrived a bit later on this island, which gave us more time to prepare.This is not to say that policy made no dference. The Republic ramped up testing faster than the UK and it closed the St Patrick’s Day parades when England did not stop events like Cheltenham. But it is also possible that it closed schools too early and is reopening them too late.One day we will better understand all the reasons for the dfering outcomes.Yet this island is coming out of lockdown very slowly, in several respects behind England. Northern Ireland’s slow exit plan has been almost forced to mirror Ireland’s.Denmark has one of the lowest death tolls in Europe and is now one of the fastest out of lockdown.It often seems that there a cross-border determination here to be seen to be dferent and more cautious than Boris Johnson because he is depicted as a reckless Tory.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: We should heed the woman who launched NHS applause and make next Thursday the last"},{"url":null,"title":"economy turmoil things can only get better ","story":"Row erupts after DUP MP Gavin Robinson says people born in Northern Ireland have to be British before they can be IrishCall for Thursday nights’ ‘clap for carers’ to endNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingNewsOpinionColumnistsAn economy in turmoil but things can only get betterIt’s not easy to be cheerful these lockdown days.

I wasn’t on all fours exactly so I didn’t fit the bill for treatment. When the job was finally completed and my plants began to grow nicely I had a running battle with slugs and, no, used tea bags do not keep the wee blighters away from your lettuce. I should get some tips from that County Tyrone photographer who dug up his front lawn to grow vegetables when he couldn’t get out to work. Jim Kerr said the gardening acted as a kind of therapy for him. I must remember that.Sticking to the safe distance rules isn’t easy. I forget myself at times whilst out walking the dog which leaves me having to perform a quick jump right or left with him yelping as I almost fall over him. I’ve tried taking him to out-of-the-way places, but he prefers to see other pooches approaching and gets bored and whingey when it’s just me and the trees. The Government stipulates that walks have to be short. I suppose that’s okit’s winter time, but this is summer. There’s been a lot of sunny days and what I wouldn’t give to take off in the car to the North Coast just to see something dferent.Ahead, there’s the possibility of a severe depressionwe can’t get our economy back on track. Unemployment is soaring into the millions and, no, the people do not want to go and pick fruit and vegetables from the ious English farms. That’s too much like hard work I suspect though I recall, as a young child, many men leaving the province and catching the Liverpool ferry and then going by train to the fruit and vegetable farms in the south. Farmers are currently looking for , UK workers as there is a shortage of the usual seasonal workers from Europe who are facing travel restrictions. When the furlough arrangement, where the Government pays  per cent of people’s wages, ends, for many there may be no jobs toto. It could be back to the s when massive workers’ strikes could not save jobs as technology was turning industry upside down.There is the other possibility that working from home can be more profitable for employers and employees – a headline in the News Letter’s business pages this week indicated that workers were getting more work done at home. The possibility that home could be the next workplace is not as far fetched as it seems. It could solve our pollution problems, doing wonders for our planet. No more smog hiding the world’s most famous buildings  Our children would be healthier.

No-one decides it for you, it depends on your personal history and beliefs and values.But citizenship is something we share with everyone who has the same citizenship. It grants us rights and protections and other countries recognise you as being part of the national community that granted it to you.I’ve lived all my le in that national community, I was born in a hospital, built and staffed by that community, drive on roads built by it, went to schools paid by it and now pay my taxes into the same United Kingdom communal funds that pay for our schools, our hospitals and police.To say that anyone who is automatically entitled to all these benefits should automatically be considered been part of our national community seems to be quite jarring.Our access to citizenship should not be treated any dferently from other parts of the same nation, because of someone ’s personal identity.Supporters of Emma DeSouza quote the Belfast Agreement, but that is a document that first and foremost confirms Northern Ireland’s position within the national community .By all means reject your citizenship nowyou want to, burn the flag you are giving upyou wish to do so, it makes a greater point to give something away than claim you never had it.But do not demand I be treated unequally to my fellow countrymen in regards to my automatic UK citizenship.Do not pick apart the agreement that allows us to find a path together peacefully.

Its important to us that we support it as much as possible.ldquoIts uplting being able to do that. It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
