Dairy farmers and processors in the US and Canada have been dumping milk after a collapse in demand following the closure of restaurants and schools, which are large buyers of dairy products, left them with a glut. The government has been asked to pay producers to cut milk output and buy up cheese, butter and other dairy products for food banks. Meanwhile, the closure of a number of US meat processing plants due to Covid-19 is leading to fears of disruption to food supplies and a lack of places for farmers to send animals.Farming groups have protested after retailers started stocking Polish mince in UK stores. Red meat processor ABP said panic buying had forced it to source Polish beef because it did not have the processing capacity to meet the surge in demand.MPs from the environment, food and rural affairs committee are launching an inquiry into how the food supply chain has been disrupted by the Covid-19 crisis and what steps are needed to manage consumer access to healthy food. The public have been asked to submit their views to the committee via an online survey.Animal welfare campaigners have expressed concern after China included wildlife such as deer, game birds, mink and foxes on a list of animals that it plans to allow to be farmed. “Rebranding wildlife as livestock doesn’t alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in farm environments … some of these species can act as intermediate hosts of viruses, such as Covid-19,” said Peter Li, China policy specialist with Humane Society International, who welcomed additional plans to ban the eating of dogs.Lastly, a micro-tannery owner has spoken out about his quest to help create a value for thousands of male “billy” dairy goats that would otherwise be killed at birth through producing luxury bags, wallets and made-to-order shoes.Camilla Saunders, from Sustainable Food Knighton, a group of local residents campaigning against a broiler unit in the town of Knighton in Powys, contacted us last week in response the article: Life in the ‘poultry capital’ of Wales: enough is enough, say overwhelmed residents.

But as everyone from Giorgione to Van Gogh can attest, separation from society can do wonders for the creative mindWhat’s a street artist to do when the streets are locked down? Banksy’s got nothing to keep him busy except create mayhem in his own bathroom. He has released photographs of what he says is his loo decorated with stencilled rats in a trompe l’oeil rodent rampage – swinging from the towel holder, balancing on a mirror frame, perching on a toilet splashed with orangey-brown matter.For these filthy beasts long associated with plague, coronavirus means party time. They are celebrating our decline and fall. Maybe Banksy sees the anarchic potential in a world that has decided to suspend normal business.Is there something about being isolated that releases the best in artists? David Hockney shares paintings of resurgent nature, Tracey Emin confesses her fears and now Banksy reveals the surreal side of spending too much time at home. Isolationism – to pin a label on these various responses to a shared crisis – is a new kind of art because this is a new kind of crisis. But artists have been isolated before, and what they produced confirms that being separated from society can do wonders for the creative mind.Artists were quarantined for illness as early as the Renaissance, when Italian cities pioneered social distancing measures as they struggled with plague. The Venetian painter Giorgione died on the lagoon city’s quarantine island Lazaretto Nuovo in 1510. According to his biographer Vasari, he chose to isolate alongside his infected lover and caught the fatal illness. On this island of socially excluded dying people, he may have created his most famous masterpiece, the Sleeping Venus. As Giorgione and his lover lay sick and isolated, he made this one last painting of her. She’s not just sleeping – she’s dying or dead. And as she lies there he records his love. (He doesn’t show the buboes, of course.)The illnesses that have usually led to the isolation of great artists, however, are mental rather than physical. Richard Dadd spent most of his adult life in the closed hospitals of Bedlam and Broadmoor after he murdered his father, who he believed was the devil. Dadd’s doctors encouraged his art even though he never recovered. He painted strange, intense portraits of his carers as well as fantastically detailed scenes of fairy life. Freedom was an escape into microscopically precise visions of tiny demonic beings. Thinking about his painting The Fairy-Feller’s Master-Stroke, I’m starting to worry about Banksy. His rampaging rats are not so different from these deliriously anarchic Victorian fairies.Vincent van Gogh accepted that he needed to be confined after he cut off his earlobe and was hounded as a “madman” by the people of Arles. He was locked up for a year in the Saint-Paul Asylum at Saint-Remy. While there, he positively thrived as an artist. He fixed his eyes on the asylum garden, its yellow corridors, its lonely patients. It was while looking out of his window in the asylum that he painted his ecstatic vision of cosmic glory The Starry Night. Vincent killed himself three months after leaving the asylum. He might have been better off staying there.Van Gogh helped inspire the 20th-century cult of “outsider art” or art Brut, which sought out and recognised the works made by asylum patients. Jean Dubuffet, apostle of art brut, promoted the work of Swiss asylum patient Aloïse Corbaz. Her swirling orange and blue fantasies have some of the electricity of The Starry Night.Other artists have chosen to self-isolate of their own free will. The great abstract painter Agnes Martin got so sick of the noise of the New York art world that she fled in 1967 to a life of solitude, living in a series of adobe dwellings she built for herself in the New Mexico desert. Her absorbing networks of ethereal marks in fields of whiteness are monuments to the peace and silence she found in her wilderness retreat. In a way she was imitating earlier women artists who lived in confinement as nuns. The Renaissance artist Plautilla Nelli spent her life in a convent in Siena but won widespread recognition.Art itself is torn between the social and the isolated. It is all about communicating with others, yet the best art is introspective. Even Banksy, whose art is nothing if not social, has been driven to his own kind of introspection: Rats! Rats! I can see rats! Then again, he chooses to be anonymous so perhaps he’s a shy person at heart.There’s something tragicomic about trying to see the bright side of coronavirus. Isolation does, however, seem to be releasing modern art’s inner hermit. Far from the madding crowds of fairs and biennials, artists are rediscovering the solitary springs of creativity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e684baded85affa38a8706ea23eccab9a9eb7c/0_229_519_311/master/519.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f8b06ba9e5c69b3a6fac6856fc0e4a76","title":"easyjet faces anything from a boom to profit less frustration","story":"Airline isn’t going bust – yet – but no one knows what the future holds for air travelIt was a tale of the good, the bad and the entertaining at easyJet. The welcome news for shareholders was that their airline is not going bust this year. That’s a low bar, but it had to be cleared.Extra borrowing, including £600m via the Bank of England-backed commercial paper scheme, means easyJet will soon have access to about £3.3bn of cash, enough to survive nine months of grounded planes, a scenario it calculates would cost a hefty £3bn.The bad news is that nobody knows when flying will resume – or, more to the point, in what form. Chief executive Johan Lundgren can whistle cheerfully about strong demand for winter bookings but rolling lockdowns across Europe, lifted and reimposed at different paces, would be hellishly disruptive.Leaving the middle seats on the planes vacant – one idea floated by Lundgren – would add yet another layer of complexity. Punters might revolt if safer spacing implied higher fares. Life for budget airlines in the first months after lockdown could be anything from boom time to profitless frustration.Haji-Ioannou’s serious point is that easyJet should simply cancel its order of new Airbus aircraft. Unfortunately, it’s not that easy, as Lundgren explained persuasively. EasyJet would lose discounts on planes already delivered and sacrifice warranties and guarantees on the current fleet. Both are very bad outcomes if you intend to stay in the flying business.Meanwhile, the delivery schedule for planes doesn’t look quite so awful after a rejig. EasyJet can reduce its fleet, currently 337, to a minimum of 281 by 2023, which isn’t a million miles from the 250 demanded by Haji-Ioannou. The founder’s campaign is a distraction. The board’s self-help strategy is more credible than his.It would be churlish not to applaud Royal Dutch Shell’s ambition to be a net zero-carbon company by 2050. And, in some respects, its declaration was better than BP’s in February.Yet the talk about “pivots” and “pathways” – two of the vaguest terms in the book of management-speak – will provoke scepticism. What does the plan mean for metrics that are easy to understand? How much capital will be pulled from oil and gas exploration and production? And how much will be redirected towards greener fuels such as hydrogen and biomass? Without details, it’s hard to judge the credibility of the plans.“As of today, Shell’s operating plans and budgets do not reflect these newly announced ambitions,” said the third footnote to Thursday’s announcement. In other words, come back later in the year to discover the stuff that really matters. It’s progress, but it’s slow.Lawrence Stroll, the Canadian billionaire, did not invest in Aston Martin out of a sense of charity. He took the plunge to make money, sensing he could bag a bargain at a low point for an over-indebted luxury car brand that he judged had more mileage left in it.The cash proceeds from the £365m rights issue, due to complete formally on Monday, are rock solid and, for that, Aston Martin has Stroll to thank. When coronavirus struck, he didn’t walk away from his consortium’s investment. He just improved his terms, as he was entitled to do, getting a bigger stake for a slightly smaller £171m investment.Now installed as chairman, Stroll has to keep the company on the road, which won’t be easy.

But the truth is, we’re nowhere near controlling coronavirusThere has not been a lot of good news lately. But with the discharge of Boris Johnson from hospital on Sunday, and statements that the “peak” strain on the National Health Service would be over the Easter period, you might be under the impression that the storm is passing, and the Covid-19 pandemic will soon be a memory.Fueling this mood are reports from studies of communities already hit by the pandemic. At long last we are beginning to see the results of work looking for signs that people have already been infected, through the presence of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19. Some of this data suggests strongly that many infections may have passed unnoticed, with the only symptoms being mild things such as loss of the ability to smell and taste, and that as a result, more people may be immune than had been thought. Surely this is a sign that communities around the world can breathe a sigh of relief and start getting back to work?Unfortunately, it is nothing of the kind.Talk of the “peak” can be misleading, because it’s not clear whether you are talking about the Matterhorn or Table Mountain – both have a summit, but the peak is far more pronounced in one than the other. In countries such as Italy (unlike Wuhan) the initial surge in the Covid-19 pandemic has not evaporated quickly. There are multiple reasons for this but the most important is that the impact of physical distancing achieved in China has been hard to accomplish elsewhere, mostly because of the freedoms we correctly value in liberal democracies.Worse, there may be a mountain range. In other words, what is happening right now could be just one peak – not the peak. And the reason for this is that despite all those positive signs from antibody testing, the huge majority of the population is not immune.An editorial in the British Medical Journal has reported data from China suggesting that as many as four in five cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection could be asymptomatic. It then goes on to quote people from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine in Oxford, who say that if this is true “What the hell are we locking down for?” I wish those people would be brave enough to go and repeat that opinion in an ER in the Bronx right now, in which actual medicine is going on. Worrying about the exact rate of asymptomatic infection, or the currently unknown duration of immunity and a possible “second wave”, is like politely applauding the performance in a jazz club and murmuring “nice” while the building is demolished around you and the piano player gets decapitated.There have been more than 93,000 cases of Covid-19 identified in the UK. Let’s round that up and say it is 100,000. So if the reports from the BMJ editorial are accurate, the actual number would be that multiplied by five, in which case there would have already been half a million infections in the UK. If this really is the peak and we see as many cases on the way down as on the way up, that would total 1 million infections from the initial surge in the UK – hopefully all of those people would then be immune.That would leave about 65 million people in the UK still without immunity.I am going to be unusually optimistic here, and assume that everyone who has Covid-19 becomes fully immune (not a given), and that the virus is towards the less transmissible end of the range of estimates currently available. If this is the case, you would need half your population to have been infected to achieve a level of population immunity that would stop the epidemic continuing to grow and overwhelming healthcare systems. As I write the UK is reporting more than 10,000 deaths from Covid-19. Due to the realities of collecting data during an infectious disease emergency like this, that is likely to be an underestimate. Again, if we assume this is the peak and there is the same number on the way down that’s 20,000 total from the initial surge. And to get to population immunity you have to multiply that by at least 30: based on the current data, that’s about 600,000 deaths to get there, minimum.Finding a vaccine to offer a complete solution to this pandemic is, even in the best scenarios, is still a long way off But it is not hard to see many ways we can slow the pace of the pandemic and save lives. One of them is greatly improved testing to identify cases and their contacts, which could be supplemented by clever digital methods to spot who has been at risk. Governments around the world are attempting ways to keep jobs and businesses afloat while lockdowns are in place – but the pressure remains to swiftly end such shutdowns. I get that this is going to be a mammoth strain on the economy. But the deaths of many thousands of people would be too: it is simply not possible to thoroughly insulate an economy from the impact of a pandemic of this kind.Where I live, in Cambridge Massachusetts, I keep hearing sirens. This crisis is not close to over, quite the reverse.

The biosafety cabinets whirr reassuringly in the background, the robots hum, and the radio blasts rock tunes. All systems are go. Then comes the call: “We are finished. No more swabs. You can go home.” It’s midday. Our shift had only started at eight.Testing is a crucial component of any public health response to an epidemic, and a key way to reduce deaths. And in UK laboratories, we now have the capacity to test tens of thousands of samples. Yet, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, recently suggested that the UK has not been increasing its testing capacity quickly enough. And Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said Germany – which can now test more than 500,000 people a week – “got ahead” in its ability to test for coronavirus. Indeed, statistics from the Department of Health show that while our cumulative deaths climbed from 4,900 on 5 April to almost 13,000 today, the number of tests carried out in the UK has stagnated at about 12,000.When health secretary Matt Hancock visited our Milton Keynes laboratory last Thursday, he avowed that our jobs were crucial, and thanked us for our service. Our workplace, where we test patient samples for the virus, has been called the “biggest diagnostic lab network in British history”, with capacity to process more than 5,000 swabs, eventually projected to reach 30,000 swabs per day. And yet at our testing centre on Tuesday this week, we processed just over 1,000 samples. The day before, the total was 1,300, and three days ago 1,800.Our shifts were meant to be excruciating 12-hour marathons. In reality, they are rather more like laid-back morning jogs. Dozens of academics and laboratory personnel from all over the UK languish in a hotel with nothing to do. Millions of pounds of equipment borrowed from universities and companies rests silently in the evening hours, when the noise of our collective toil should be deafening.The problem does not lie in the laboratories, or the personnel. The UK has an army of skilled researchers at its disposal. More than 1,200 scientists had volunteered their expertise in the fight against coronavirus in Cambridge alone by early April. Dozens signed up to help in Milton Keynes. The equipment and reagents are all available, now that Thermo Fisher Scientific has confirmed it will supply the UK with all the testing kits it needs. And “scale up” has been the mantra at Milton Keynes since I arrived last Monday. We were promised 5,000 samples “to begin with”. We never saw those numbers. They told us we should prepare for a 24-hour operation, but we are done in four or five.Disappointment abounds – and understandably so: all the staff, volunteers and managers have mobilised in an unprecedented manner for the mission. They created a world-class Covid-19 diagnostic centre from scratch in a couple of weeks, with precise protocols, standard operating procedures and training expertise to go with it. The tests are accurate, quality control checks are run daily and improvements constantly implemented. The lab continues to scale up and expand, with new robots and automated procedures coming online every day. The expertise and dedication of the frontline staff and management is truly commendable. It is proof of the excellence of the UK bioscience sector.So, what is the problem? Where is the bottleneck? Maybe it is simply that fewer people were tested over the Easter weekend. But the virus does not respect holidays. Some days, we have been told that more than 4,000 swabs were offered, but people did not take advantage of them. Fine – but surely those swabs could be repurposed, and the spare capacity redirected? And even if test numbers do pick up today, or tomorrow, the rate of increase is far too slow for both the scale of this emergency and what our laboratories can handleWe are all being let down by a government that may have decided testing is, after all, not that important, despite the successful examples set by South Korea and Germany. On 12 April, the United States performed 140,000 tests. Italy more than 48,000. Turkey 35,000. Germany is averaging 50,000 a day. In the UK, total tests numbered just short of 16,000 on Tuesday. Just in our lab, we could have easily done 8,000. We are ready why aren’t we being sent more swabs?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79dd94bcb84c54fd3455fa0730eaedd4f8522f0e/47_40_2967_1781/master/2967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b63c4dbb65d6d2ffb63930b8397d1eeb","title":"thousands of pupils in england miss out on first choice primary school","story":"Competition for places remains strong in London, Birmingham and other hotspots Thousands of families in England have failed to secure a place for their child in their first choice of primary school amid continuing high demand in London, Birmingham and other hotspots across the country.While schools remain largely closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, families across the country received emails on national primary offer day on Thursday, informing them which school their child will go to in September.After a spike in the birthrate beginning in the early 2000s, there has been a gradual flattening in the number of four- and five-year-olds enrolling in primary school. But some local authorities reported an increase in applications this year and a fall in the proportion of children getting into their first-choice school.For families wishing to appeal, the Department for Education has announced plans to temporarily relax regulations so that hearings can go ahead despite the Covid-19 restrictions. They will no longer need to be attended in person.Richard Long, Kent county council’s cabinet member for education and skills, said: “Since the partial closure of all our schools last month, everyone involved in the provision of education has … been working in challenging circumstances, and it is a credit to them that we are still able to release offers today.” Long said: “I appreciate that for those families who did not receive one of their preferences there will be feelings of disappointment and concern today. I would like to reassure them that this is just the first stage of the application process.“Families have the option to appeal or join a waiting list for an alternative school if they are not happy with their allocation and there is likely to be considerable movement between now and September as families do not take up places they are offered.”Gail Tolley, spokesperson for the Pan-London Admissions Board and strategic lead for children and young people at Brent Council, said: “Coordinating more than 97,000 applications to primary schools across 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation is always a complex task – and this year the coronavirus pandemic has put even more pressure on boroughs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e77cae5e3e78daf7130a3f267b4e70d1a8f99d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e6126b9180154e00ebd12b3f69ec345","title":"home birds how to spot 20 of the most common species from your window walk or garden","story":"Now there’s no traffic noise to drown out their sounds, it’s a perfect time to learn how to distinguish birds by their songsAs our cities, and even parts of the countryside, have fallen eerily silent, with traffic and aircraft a distant memory, many of us have started to notice a new sound: birdsong.Now that spring has well and truly sprung, this is the ideal time to get to know your local birds.

Several other researchers, including an EmiControls representative, were unable to join the crew as planned because of Covid-19 travel restrictions.A seperate vessel 5km away carrying atmospheric modelling equipment was able to detect the mist created by the prototype. Future experiments will measure if the salt particles do brighten clouds.The cloud-brightening approach is just one of 43 concepts being funded under a $150m government-backed research and development program announced on Thursday.Scientists are racing to find measures that could be used to reduce the impact of rising ocean temperatures on corals caused by global heating.Harrison said the technology, deployed in March under a permit from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, had promise because it was relatively cheap, could be deployed at scale and kick-started a process that occurs naturally.“Nature does most of the work for you,” he said. “This makes a nano-sized salt crystal at hundreds of trillions per second. They get into a cloud and grow a cloud droplet that reflects a lot more sunlight.”Harrison said the technique was effectively boosting a natural process, because clouds mostly form over the ocean when moisture gathers around salt crystals stirred up by winds from the ocean surface.“We thought we might only be able to detect it a couple of kilometres downwind, but we detected it 5km downwind,” Harrison said.Scientists on the barge said they could see corals “bleaching around us” as they carried out the experiment.Harrison and the core team drove 3,600km north to Townsville from Coffs Harbour, and back, camping and preparing their own food along the way to remain isolated from others not involved in the project as Covid-19 travel restrictions began to be rolled out.Future research will also examine any downstream risks from the technique, and any local impacts on rainfall.Manduburra traditional owner Usop Drahm, who joined the expedition, said: “We welcome scientific research where Indigenous people and the rest of Australia work together to maintain the reef ecosystem for future generations.“This technology might help prevent bleaching and we like that it uses no chemicals and relies on natural processes.”The salt crystals would have remained in the air for only one or two days in the initial experiment, he said. The approach does not make clouds, but brightens those already in the atmosphere.There are plans to scale up the experiment using more and larger turbines so that their output is about 10 times larger.This, Harrison said, could cover an area of hundreds of square kilometres – a scale large enough to slightly cool ocean temperatures.Within four years, Harrison said, it was hoped the project would show a brightening response in the clouds.But he said the success of such projects would depend on action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.He said as temperatures went up, the cloud brightening technique became less and less effective at protecting corals from mass bleaching."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e31352ddcbca0262cc2659c4dcdb5da0558c9812/0_11_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c711200caa3987ddc7d51835dcf9173","title":"self isolating animals species social distancing wwf","story":"WWF has compiled a list of animal species whose social behaviours make them self-isolation experts.

In fact, its cult status is on the rise. Despite having been primetime Friday-night viewing for seven years, The Golden Girls does not currently have the binge-watching availability of, say, Friends, because it is not available on streaming platforms such as Netflix (although you can buy past series on iTunes and Amazon). Instead, the current influx of fans get their fix via Instagram, where Golden Girls has been hash-tagged more than 600,000 times on accounts such as Golden Girls Daily and Golden Girls Love, which are approaching 50,000 followers each. Some episodes have been uploaded to YouTube, and the revival took a further step into the mainstream when Golden Girls backgrounds were recently made available for the video conferencing app Zoom.You can also buy Golden Girls-themed everything, from Monopoly, Cluedo and Trivial Pursuit, to Pez dispensers, action figures and even breakfast cereal. There are 11,000 Golden Girls products available on Redbubble alone. In 2016, Ryan Reynolds paid $10,000 to the estate of Bea Arthur to wear the actor’s likeness on a vest in the Deadpool movie, and the ladies have shown up in modern children’s cartoons, including Teen Titans GO! (“That ring can manifest any weapon imaginable and you choose The Golden Girls?”) and The Amazing World of Gumball.In uncertain times there is something comforting about The Golden Girls. Of course, at times it is hideously dated and it’s fuzzy as hell, but the jokes are surprisingly fresh, the politics progressive and, bear with me here, the fashion is actually more wearable than you might imagine. Check out some enduring trends showcased by each of Miami’s feistiest citizens.Southern belle Blanche was the good time Girl. She craved attention and she sure got it, with a wardrobe of custom gowns, pant suits and nightwear – well, she did spend a lot of time in bed. Blanche knew that a well-cut blazer could pull any look together, and that shoulder pads had a way of balancing things out – which is just as well, with hair so teased and bouffed. As the youngest of the group, the museum assistant was comfortable in casual looks, wearing jeans and giving sportswear a touch of luxe decades before athleisure became a thing. Rue McClanahan was contractually allowed to keep all of her character’s custom-made clothes, which reportedly filled 13 closets.Rose is a kind-hearted country girl and her wardrobe exudes a down-to-earth simplicity and charm. As a grief counsellor, Rose’s look was warm and approachable – hence her collection of comedy jumpers. Statement sweaters are serious business on today’s catwalks and it’s easy to imagine Rose (played by Betty White) in a cute Iceberg pullover or Ralph Lauren teddy bear knit. The circle of style has spun enough times that Rose’s love of pussybows is also very of the moment, , while her penchant for a crisp knotted shirt is as timeless as tales of Earnest T Minkie and The Great Herring War.Dorothy’s outfits were so directional that MC Escher could have designed them: everything cut on the bias, lines zig-zagging this way and that, origami necklines, trompe l’oeil waistcoats – you never knew where to look and that may have been the point. Substitute teacher Dorothy was a no-nonsense character favouring tailored neutrals and layered looks with 20s-inspired drop-waists, duster coats and tunics with wide-legged palazzo pants – still a summer staple. She never wore heels, preferring slouchy boots or sandals, because the actor Bea Arthur hated wearing shoes. Picture it: Shady Pines retirement home, 1985, a poor, widowed woman flees a terrible fire with nothing more than bifocals and a clunky wicker handbag. Sophia lugged that thing everywhere – proof that if that you invest in a quality bag, you’ll want to show it off. The bag actually belonged to the actor Estelle Getty, who used it for her audition and clearly nailed it. Sophia had a sweet old lady style that belied the sharp Sicilian woman that lurked beneath her Peter Pan collars and polycotton florals. She was also the queen of cardies – the dimmer switch of knitwear and, therefore, one of the most functional items to own. Plus a cardigan is never going to ruin your hair and it has pockets.

So where should you start with his movies? Not Frears’ finest hour – nor Judi Dench’s either. Sadly, this is a toe-curlingly coy piece of Blitz-kitsch nostalgia, with Dench as the supercilious grande dame Mrs Henderson who buys the Windmill theatre in London’s Soho and turns it into a saucy nude revue that stays open, despite the Luftwaffe’s bombs.A desperately creaky, stuffy, airless period piece, based on the Colette novels. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the elegant courtesan in belle epoque France who is tasked with giving a sentimental education to a boy she calls Chéri, played by Rupert Friend. The cast look like tailor’s dummies in period garb being wheeled around on castors. A pound-shop Les Liaisons Dangereuses.The “greatest fight” is Ali’s legal fight in the mid-60s when he was stripped of his world boxing title for refusing to fight in Vietnam, and his appeal reached the supreme court. But this film, obtusely, doesn’t dramatise Ali himself, concentrating on the elderly judges, the cue for much twinkle-eyed character acting from Frank Langella and Christopher Plummer. It doesn’t land much of a punch.In which Dench reprises her impersonation of Queen Victoria. The first time around, she was crushing hard on her ghillie, John Brown, played by Billy Connolly, and now it is her Muslim Indian servant Abdul Karim, played by Ali Fazal, in this based-on-a-true-story film. However, it’s a very coy and bland piece of inoffensive heritage cinema.This is a broad caper about gambling, the excitement of which is difficult to convey properly to uninitiated audiences. It is based on the avowedly true-life memoir of a woman who came to Vegas looking to be nothing more than a cocktail waitress and wound up deeply involved with the scarythrilling high-rollers. Rebecca Hall is our heroine and Bruce Willis her grouchy boss. A bit moderate.This multicultural London movie that Frears made in the Thatcher era was interesting, but didn’t quite come off. The Sammy and Rosie of the title are Ayub Khan Din and Frances Barber, who have a bohemian existence in the capital then Sammy’s father (Shashi Kapoor) comes from Pakistan, disrupting their precarious happiness.This was a big role for Dustin Hoffman and an interesting and lively high-concept story – but the chemistry didn’t quite work for the film to do as well as it might have done. He plays an oddball hustler midway between his characters in Rain Man and Midnight Cowboy. When a plane crashes on a highway, he drives up to the wreck and saves people’s lives but then has to leave – and finds that someone else is taking the credit for his heroism. Not a bad tale.Julia Roberts’s weird attempt at an Irish accent probably sank this movie, but it has got a lot to recommend it. It’s a retelling of the Jekyll and Hyde story from the point of view of the maid (Roberts), who has no idea that her master, Dr Jekyll, and his sinister friend, Mr Hyde, are the same person – both played by John Malkovich. Atmospheric and interesting.An entertaining selection of well-directed performances keep this film going. Terence Stamp is the supergrass ex-criminal exiled in Spain who finds that old comrades have caught up with him, intent on settling scores. Played by John Hurt and a livewire young Tim Roth, they are disconcerted by Stamp’s Zen acceptance of the situation.With a brutally tough screenplay from Jimmy McGovern, Frears strays here into what could be called Terence Davies territory. It’s an account of a 1930s Catholic boyhood in Liverpool, in which Ian Hart plays Liam’s dad, an embittered, unemployed docker with a taste for the booze who becomes a Mosleyite blackshirt, to his family’s dismay. A tough watch, and atypically bleak for Frears.The strange case of Lance Armstrong is what Frears addresses in this serviceable biopic written by John Hodge. Ben Foster plays the fiercely committed, impregnably arrogant Armstrong, the Tour de France cyclist who first became an inspirational figure for surviving cancer, only to become notorious for doping and then a long battle with his own awful PR. Foster is very good at conveying Armstrong’s beady-eyed fanaticism and inability to reconcile his “underdog hero” view of himself with the public’s deep disappointment.This is just the type of film that responds well to Frears’ gift for getting strong, clear, funny performances across the board, and building the storytelling around them. Colm Meaney plays a shiftless guy in late-80s Ireland who is reasonably happy on welfare but has a Damascene conversion to entrepreneurialism. When his best mate Bimbo discovers an abandoned catering van, the pair have a plan to clean it up (sort of) and sell burgers and chips outside sports grounds. But their big dreams of fast-food wealth go horribly wrong.This is one of Frears’ most underrated movies – a western, to which he brings a cool, understated intelligence and revisionist flair, working from a script by Walon Green, who also wrote The Wild Bunch. Patricia Arquette plays a lonely woman in postwar New Mexico who is drawn to a number of men who aren’t her husband: Billy Crudup’s young rancher and Woody Harrelson’s outrageously brash cowboy. The booming-voiced Sam Elliott plays a wealthy local man who tries to help and advise the hopelessly naive Crudup. A film with real texture and force.Another underrated movie from Frears, this satire canters enjoyably through the world of English middle-class hypocrisy and vanity. Frears makes this kind of comedy look easy, which is perhaps why it doesn’t get its due. Screenwriter Moira Buffini adapts Posy Simmonds’ graphic novel about a young woman (Gemma Arterton) who returns to her sleepy home village with a nose job and a glamorous position in the media, and promptly shakes everything up. There are great performances in particular from Roger Allam and Tamsin Greig.This debut feature is an early gem in the Frears canon, with a great ensemble supporting cast including Frank Finlay and Billie Whitelaw, and a taut script from Neville Smith. Albert Finney stars as Eddie, an ordinary guy in Liverpool who is a bingo-caller and cheesy nightclub comic turn, with an unsightly line in the ugly racist banter of that era. But he also exists in a Walter Mitty fantasy world of private detectives, idolising the screen persona of Humphrey Bogart. When Eddie actually tries to live the private detective dream, by placing an ad for his dubious services in the local paper, someone actually takes him up on it. Soon he is hopelessly out of his depth and his unhinged mental state deteriorates.This biopic combines sentimentality, comedy and deep strangeness in equal measure. Meryl Streep plays the deluded amateur soprano and fashionable hostess Florence Foster Jenkins, whose off-key warbling at private events horrified 40s New York high society – but everyone was too polite to say anything, or too keen on Mrs Jenkins’s lavish patronage and generosity to comment (other than giggling among themselves). Hugh Grant takes his career to the next level with a great performance as Jenkins’s partner and husband in all but name, a failed thesp who sympathises with Florence’s big dreams and wishes only to bring her some happiness. Streep and Grant are a lovely combination and their gentle chemistry, nurtured by Frears, allows this film to grow on you. At the end, you are laughing with them, not at them.Before there was The Crown, there was this movie, which bears about the same relationship to the racy TV show as Robert Altman’s Gosford Park does to the later small-screen romp Downton Abbey. Screenwriter Peter Morgan showed his witty post-Tussaud mastery of fabricating the private talk of the great and the good, and Helen Mirren gives a lovely, award-winning impersonation of the Queen during the great crisis of 1997 when Princess Diana had just died in a car accident and the public and press appeared to be genuinely turning against Her Majesty for the first time in her long reign. Michael Sheen plays the young and guilelessly pushy new prime minister Tony Blair, who presumes to tell the Queen how to manage public opinion — and also wonders how her loss in reputation might result in a corresponding gain for his. Frears orchestrates all this with terrific brio and gusto, finding that keynote of comic indulgence amid the supposed seriousness and political gossip.This urban-myth thriller from screenwriter Steven Knight has all the ingredients that Frears knows how to blend: a strong, accessible, exciting (and scary) story and three fiercely drawn characters, played to the hilt by three outstandingly good actors – Chiwetel Ejiofor, Audrey Tautou and Sergi Lopez – whose contributions are managed with great skill by the director. Ejiofor is the Nigerian “illegal” in London, working as a hotel night porter and driving a minicab during the day Tautou is the similarly illegal Turkish woman working as a chambermaid at the same hotel, and Lopez is the sinister hotel manager who informs them that hotels are places where discretion among staff is essential. When Tautou and Ejiofor discover a grisly criminal conspiracy, their story tells us something about inequality and exploitation and how London relies on immigrants as a servant class, who must be demonised so that their wages can be kept low and their working conditions poor. Frears paints the drama with a slightly broad brush, but this is a great, underrated British movie, as relevant today as ever.In so many ways, High Fidelity is the perfect Frears project: relatable, smart, romantic, funny and sad, building on British wit to create a Hollywood picture with an indie sensibility. It was adapted from Nick Hornby’s bestseller, transposing the action from north London to Chicago, and turning the hangdog, lovelorn owner of a record store (a retail concept that was more or less extinct even in 2000) into an American: John Cusack, whoalso co-wrote the film. The casting was perfect, and introduced Jack Black to a wider audience as Barry, the testy and massively opinionated music buff and store assistant who makes it his business to terrorise those customers whose tastes do not come up to scratch. Cusack’s character has just been dumped, and all his misery and yearning are channelled into the music he loves. Is music where his fidelity or loyalty really lies, or can music be the gateway drug to real love and a real relationship? This film has been remade and re-franchised over the past 20 years, but this is the original and best.Frears delivered power, intrigue and sexual menace with this story of elegant cynicism set in 18th-century France – a parable of the arrogant ennui that prefigured the revolution. Glenn Close and John Malkovich play the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, former lovers who now jadedly amuse each other with their respective tales of adventures in seduction and the ruination of innocents. The Marquise spitefully bets the Vicomte that he can’t have his way with a certain comely young woman (Uma Thurman), who has had the audacity to accept a marriage proposal from the Marquise’s current lover, thus ending their arrangement. The Vicomte accepts the wager with alacrity and also sets out for another bedpost-notch: the lovely, virtuously married Madame de Tourvel, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. These liaisons are indeed dangerous in ways that the older epicures do not understand. They can fall in love, and fall in other ways as well. The central scene, when the entire theatre turns hissingly on the disgraced Marquise, is genuinely scary. The keynotes of drama and tragedy are atypical for Frears, but he handles them tremendously.A recent re-release woke us up to what a belter this is, and what a masterly exercise in drama and characterisation from Frears, who guides two cracking performances from Gary Oldman and Alfred Molina in a true story of scandal and tragedy. Oldman plays the brilliant and troubled young dramatist Joe Orton who, in the 1960s, set the London arts scene alight with his talentand made no secret of his homosexuality, but evaded censure in an era when it was still illegal. Molina is Kenneth Halliwell, his lover and best friend who becomes unstable and obsessively jealous of Orton’s colossal success while his own career as an actor is fizzling out. Eventually, this toxic and dysfunctional relationship explodes into violence. Alan Bennett’s tremendous script is based on John Lahr’s biography with its cheeky, naughty pun in the title. Vanessa Redgrave has a cameo as Joe’s legendary agent, Peggy Ramsay. It is the perfect Frears storm of great actors, smart script and absorbing drama.Frears brings us a classic of 80s British cinema here, with its script by Hanif Kureishi, a film that refuses to run on the usual rails of commercial film-making or even on the rails of politically correct or right-on attitudising, despite boldly taking on racism and homophobia. A young and exquisitely beautiful Daniel Day-Lewis plays Johnny, a racist thug who appears to be about to attack Omar (played by Gordon Warnecke). He is a south Asian guy of Pakistani extraction whose wealthy, worldly uncle has put him in charge of one of his laundrettes, one of a string of faintly dodgy business interests. But there is a complication: Johnny and Omar are lovers, and their relationship finds a kind of ironic symbol in the laundrette that may yet get turned into an unlikely thing of beauty. And so the film unexpectedly and subversively taps into the new Thatcherite enthusiasm for small-business entrepreneurialism (it was a time when Thatcher’s Enterprise Allowance Scheme, while undoubtedly intended to keep unemployment figures low, was taken up by many in the leftie arts world).A modern classic about con artists, this also stars Cusack and is adapted by Donald Westlake from the novel by pulp master Jim Thompson, but finds something a little softer and more emollient than might otherwise be the case for Thompson (less shocking, for example, than his The Killer Inside Me). Cusack plays Roy, a small-time confidence trickster whose mother (and fellow con artist) Lilly, played by Angelica Huston, takes an instant dislike to Roy’s new girlfriend Myra (Annette Bening). This emotional triangulation is the driving force behind calamitous new criminal complications, involving an awful psychological disclosure. In some ways, the most devastating moment comes with Roy’s first misjudgment: a silly little scam to trick bartenders out of high-denomination bills winds up with him getting punched in the stomach by his intended victim with shocking ferocity. When a cop stops to ask the hunched-over Roy if he is all right, Roy obviously can’t say what’s happened and, suppressing gasps of agony has to make light of it, claiming to have food poisoning: a symbol of the self-destructive and dishonest denial that has been going on his whole life.Frears’ chef-d’oeuvre has everything: accessibly rooted in a true story, it has a powerful but controlled display of emotions, is tempered with poignancy and wit, and has great performances from stars and supporting cast. Judi Dench gives one of her best ever performances as Philomena Lee, a tough Irish woman who is on a mission to find out what happened to the baby boy that was taken from her when she became pregnant in the 1950s and was sent to one of Ireland’s notorious “Magdalene laundries”. These were workhouse-style homes for unwed young mothers that allowed childless Catholic couples from the United States to come and adopt the wretched women’s babies in return for a cash donation to the church (naturally, the mothers themselves were not allowed a say in the matter). In effect, a machine for turning shame into money. Steve Coogan plays Martin Sixsmith, the former journalist and New Labour spin doctor who has recently endured a shame of his own relating to a leaked email. It is Sixsmith who helps Philomena on her mission to confront the arrogant hypocrisy of the church. Dench gives a lovely performance as Philomena and Coogan – whose acting skills are often undervalued – is excellent as well. It is a film with all the components for a Frears gem, and the most important is heart. Its compassion and tenderness radiate from the screen.

Today, however, many are claiming that El Hoyo – known in English as The Platform – is the perfect parable for life in the time of the coronavirus and a visceral investigation of how a crisis can expose not only the stratification of human society but also the immutable strands of selfishness coded into our DNA.The parallels are certainly not hard to find. The Platform is set in a forbidding “vertical self-management centre” – a soaring series of concrete cells stacked one on top of the other, each holding two inmates. Every day, the eponymous platform, stacked with a lavish but finite supply of food and drink, descends, level by level.Those on each floor are free to decide how much they eat and how much they leave for those on the hundreds of levels beneath them. If they gorge themselves, they will starve those below if they try to hoard food, the temperature in their cell will rise or fall fatally.While Gaztelu-Urrutia is delighted by the film’s growing audience on Netflix, he is as surprised by its freshly minted relevance as anyone else. “It’s an allegory about the distribution of wealth, which is a universal debate and a debate that’s been going on for as long as people have been around,” he told the .“But I remember when we were showing it at a film festival in Toronto last year, people were saying, ‘Shit! Historically speaking, this is the ideal moment to be showing a film like this because the differences between those who have the most and those who have the least have never been as great as they are now.’ And I’d say, ‘Well actually it’s always the perfect time to be screening a film like The Platform because we’ve always been living through at a time when these differences are so stark.’”But the director, who describes himself as “basically very pessimistic about us as a species”, acknowledges that the pandemic and the film’s presence on one of the world’s largest streaming platforms have given the movie a new lease of life. “With the new showing on Netflix, it’s suddenly become very topical again because of the current situation,” he said. “If, instead of putting food on the platform, we’d made it face masks or toilet paper or ventilators, we’d be having exactly the same debate.”The other week, added Gaztelu-Urrutia, he was listening to Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, lament that US states were engaged in a bidding war for ventilators. “That’s exactly what happens in The Platform,” he said.“When things take a turn for the worse and we get squeezed a bit, we become very, very selfish and start stockpiling everything we can, just in case. We don’t realise that that kind of greed means a lot of other people have to go without.”Although Gaztelu-Urrutia stresses that the film – which began life as a theatre piece – contains instantly recognisable universal themes, it doesn’t hide its Spanish roots. If there are occasional echoes of films such as High Rise, and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife \u0026amp Her Lover, there are also pointed nods to Luis Buñuel’s The Exterminating Angel. A copy of Don Quixote features heavily, as do the issues of imprisonment and free will explored in Pedro Calderón de la Barca’s seminal Golden Age play Life is a Dream.At its heart, though, it is a film with an uncomfortable message. “The point of The Platform is that it isn’t about a war between those above and those below – we all have someone above us and someone below us,” he said.It’s all very well, Gaztelu-Urrutia added, to demand action from the politicians and multibillionaires so many floors above, but their response – or lack of it – cannot be used to absolve us of inidual responsibility. “You can look above you and think that the people up there should be doing much more, but then you look down and see there are many levels below yours,” he said. “The question is: what am I going to do from where I am to fight this selfish structure that runs throughout our society and species?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06368ad360f2990d2ea867cd4d2959c71ea5f464/1_0_5251_3152/master/5251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dda19372c8ff2a251ed2f54d35a05d8a","title":"coronavirus lockdown friendship understanding sausage","story":"Making it through these days of coronavirus lockdown means taking joy in the smallest of thingsIt is mid-morning on day whatever of this lockdown, and I’m doing what I need to do to be me. I am standing in front of the open fridge, surveying the contents, which sprawl across each other like donated shoes at a jumble sale. Plates of leftovers perch on top of each other, a function of catering each night as if, come the morning, an invading army will be pillaging the land. I spot a couple of cooked sausages, the cheap ones made with less loin, and more nostril, lip and nipple because one of my family members likes those and right now, we all get what we damn well like. I tear off a solid inch of cold, cheap fried sausage. I pop it into my mouth, slam the fridge door shut and move on. Nothing to see here. I delight in the way my teeth crack through the taut artificial skin to the heat-set, unnaturally pink, salty protein inside.Judge me at your peril. As far as I am concerned, the only way through all this lies in a mixed emotional economy. Yes, we need friendship and compromise selflessness, understanding and a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc at day’s end. But an inch of cheap sausage also has a part to play. Of course there are grand, intricate cooking projects to give our days texture one morning I discovered I was fortunate to have, hidden in the freezer, some chunky pork ribs. In total I spent six hours searing, braising, glazing and grilling them. It was a perfect distraction, with dinner to finish.But where food is concerned, I have concluded that making it through the days also demands taking joy in the very smallest of things. They are the florid punctuation marks across aching expanses of untextured time. There are the obvious ones like stopping to sniff the newly opened pack of coffee, which we know smells better than the coffee ever tastes, but we must all of us learn to live in the moment. Then there are those which are more personal. I love running my finger along the flat of a knife at the end of breakfast to gather up the leftover smears of butter and Marmite and perhaps the odd toasted crumb for texture. I try to do this unwitnessed because I don’t have the energy to deal with other people’s ill-formed judgments.If I told you I was capable of stopping at the cupboard to take a neat teaspoonful of crunchy peanut butter you would think less of me. So I won’t tell you that. Instead I’ll tell you that, occasionally, I might return to the fridge, find the piece of stilton we keep for blue cheese emergencies and crumble off the smallest of pieces between thumb and forefinger, just to get the tiny flavour hit.In the same way, I love the fragments of vinegared spring onion that get left in the emptied salad bowl. I have also never met a tiny, crusty bit of indeterminate something – baked blood? Incinerated dairy solids? – caked to the bottom of the tin after a chicken has been roasted in it that I didn’t adore. See also the brown crunchy stuff in the pan after frying bacon. Mind not to burn your fingertips, though let’s be honest: the pain is worth it.I am aware that these confessions display a pronounced lack of shame. Well, innocent as charged. Because, in a pandemic lockdown, when your family has become your social life, the world is literally too small and enclosed for feeling shame about things which aren’t shameful. Weird is not the same as wrong, and we all need to find our joy where we can. If I find mine in a nugget of cold, cheap sausage I think that’s OK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf8715ba55f4f6c1c7924f7a4c3bc3bce609301/0_0_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f460632dc8d21741864b492fea8a19b8","title":"david athertons recipe for laksa noodle soup","story":"A rich and fresh broth that is either easy or very easy to make, depending on whether you decide to make the paste yourself or buy itHydrating and warming, this is a go-to dish for me after a long run in winter.

They’re already hereAs the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund loomed closer this week, an uplifting tweet from Faustino Asprilla began doing the rounds. “Mike Ashley saw fans of Newcastle like bar codes, hopefully that will end soon this team is for lovers not for just merchandisers,” Asprilla wrote, focusing on the departure of the unloved current ownership.Even within the tin-eared nexus of social media there is an element of double-take about the response. To date Asprilla’s tweet has received 8,000 likes and retweets. Scroll down the replies and the attitude towards the prospective change of guard is unreservedly positive. Hand-clap emojis “Class” we deserve more get rid of greed in football (seriously!) – and not just from long-suffering fans, from paid observers too.At which point it is necessary to take a step back, slap yourself a few hundred times around the head to shake off the cognitive dissonance, and attempt to process how the scales of good and bad seem to work around here. Exit, the House of Karrimor. Enter, the austere and unforgiving House of Saud, a process that is somehow being hailed as a victory for “lovers” and the end (more laughter in the dark) of the cynical commodifying of Newcastle United.Perhaps it is time here for a tale of the tape. Mike Ashley: pig-headed retail magnate. Saudi Arabia: blood-stained inherited dictatorship. Mike Ashley: zero hours contracts in his sports shops. Saudi Arabia: beheaded 37 men in a single day. Mike Ashley: showed disrespect to Rafa Benítez. Saudi Arabia: murdered and dismembered Jamal Khashoggi. Is this useful at all?Ashley wants to sell you a cheap nylon tracksuit. Saudi Arabia wants to sell you a soft-focus view of its oppressive regime, safe in the knowledge that a mega-spending spree will provide instant distraction, thereby treating the fanbase of a great British football club as useful idiots in the soft‑power game. “We’re getting our club back,” has been a refrain in the last few days. Really? Because it looks more like something more precious is being taken away.To date the most common responses have included: you never mentioned Club X or indeed Club Y, who are also owned by sportswashing regimes. Another popular theme is that journalists stick up for Mike Ashley because he’s “from London” (Ashley is from Buckinghamshire. Mohammed bin Salman, on the other hand, is much more of a Londoner: he does at least own a fair bit of it).This time, however, it does feel as though something has changed. Perhaps we are at a tipping point in this process. Because the whataboutery does actually have some substance. Newcastle may be the headline act, but they’re not even half the story.If we really are to make a stand on this, to suggest that a regime where homosexuality is punishable by flogging (awkward Rainbow Laces day ahead) isn’t a desirable guest at the top table of British sport, then that process is going to require a hasty rewind. The fact is, the Saudis aren’t coming. They’re already here, carried through the financial arms of the PIF like some irresistible super‑virus particle.It is a process to which the wider world of sport has already given in. We are all Saudis now, touched in some form by the success of the 2016 national transformation project, designed to diminish Saudi dependence on oil and create a pop-up global leisure economy.The WWE and world boxing are on board. Even dear old moral high hats Barcelona have a commercial link with Samba, a Saudi finance company.It’s no secret why this is happening. Throwing money into sport is a shortcut to cultural legitimacy, and certainly much easier than keeping Amnesty International happy. The question is what, if anything, those who still have the will to see sporting clubs as a special case, a protected industry, are willing to do about it.There are some changes that could help. A rule against sovereign wealth funds owning majority stakes in football clubs would be a start. Some kind of genuine fit and proper test is conceivable, one that involves a clearly defined notion of moral probity.And yet, you can already feel this collapsing. In a world where nobody is clean, where every hedge fund is connected to something grey, where even professional journalists struggle to see the difference between the harm done by leveraged buyouts and the moral vacuity of nation-state reputation washing, it is easy to fall into moral relativism, to lose any confidence in the ability to say this is not a desirable outcome.At the end of which Mohammed bin Salman is coming up the path in a black and white striped shirt.

The trend was particularly marked in the past 30 years.The research was conducted by Dr Sam Friedman, an associate professor at the department of sociology at the London School of Economics, and Dr Aaron Reeves, a senior research fellow at Oxford University’s department of social policy and intervention. They found elites were more recently adopting a blend of the highbrow and ordinary, suggesting an attempt to find commonality with the rest of the population, while still signifying their eliteness.“Put simply, as elites have pulled away economically, there is mounting evidence that they are increasingly insecure about their moral legitimacy, and increasingly sensitive to public concern they are snobbish, self-interested and out of touch.”How elites presented their cultural lives had become a key PR battleground, he said. “Performing ordinariness may provide a very effective means of shoring up authenticity in an era of rising inequality.”Friedman likened it to Boris Johnson declaring his hobby of making model buses during last year’s Conservative leadership campaign, “when he actually enjoys incredibly highbrow painting and Greek literature”, which he chose not to talk about.Reeves said it mattered what people played on Desert Island Discs, which was an even more public performance of cultural identity. “Tony Blair famously convened a focus group – as he did for many things – to help him calculate what to play,” he said.Examining Who’s Who, researchers found three distinct historical periods. In the 19th century, landed gentry pursuits of hunting, shooting, polo and sailing were common, influenced by the “season” in the elite social calendar.At the turn of the 20th century, as “nouveau riche” industrialists infiltrated high society, the elite turned to London-centric theatre, ballet, classical music, literature and opera, influenced in particular by the Bloomsbury Group, which included figures such as Virginia Woolf.The third phase began in the 1950s, when the art world legitimised popular cultural forms, alongside a generational decline in snobbery and deference, Friedman and Reeves said in their paper. That phase first reveals a rise in entries mentioning football, cinema, and mundane practices like spending time with family, friends and pets.Reeves said: “The move towards mundane and everyday leisure pursuits doesn’t necessarily mean elites are actually becoming ordinary, of course.”More, it revealed how they wished to present themselves. Researchers found traditional aristocratic recreations, like horse-riding and polo, were still mentioned alongside the more commonplace.Elites were, perhaps, trying to forge a sense of commonality and connection, added Friedman. “And the way they do that is to try to cultivate a cultural profile that they feel looks like the ‘everyman’.” There was also a trend towards humour in listings, for example, “loud music, strong cider”.Who’s Who, which has been published annually since 1849, was an “unrivalled” record from which to analyse how elites signalled their superior social position via the consumption of culture, the research states.The academics’ paper From Aristocratic to Ordinary: Shifting Modes of Elite Distinction is published in American Sociological Review."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra. Mimicking the ambience of a traditional pub, remote revellers participate in games and quizzes, plus attend talks on subjects ranging from homebrewing to Belgian beer.Even Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is a fan of Houseparty, the chat app where groups have been throwing virtual dinner parties, staging karaoke singalongs and playing board games. Quarantine quizzes have flourished, too (check out Edinburgh-based Goose’s Quizzes on Twitch), along with online book clubs: Yiyun Li’s #TolstoyTogether sees the author lead fellow bibliophiles in a daily War and Peace reading. Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch 13-year-old London schoolboy Jude Cannon’s bar mitzvah in his parents’ living room after his original one was cancelled, while in China one wedding was livestreamed to 3 million people.

To help the 1.2 million subscribers doing PE with Wicks each morning, internet providers such as Vodafone are flexing to provide the powerful network we rely on to keep our kids active. Domestic dancing has also taken off: see Fame legend Debbie Allen’s Instagram Live lessons (one recent light-the-sky-up-like-a-flame workout attracted 34,000 people), or the English National Ballet’s Tamara Rojo’s Facebook classes.Online rendezvous: Fitness app Urban offers private, livestreamed classes (in yoga, physiotherapy, mindfulness and personal training), pairing you with a self-employed professional whose livelihood may have been affected by the pandemic.In recent weeks, Netflix Party, the Chrome extension that allows groups of friends to watch and comment on series and movies together, at the same time, has turned television into a communal activity again: something that only happens at Christmas or during the World Cup. Its live chat room might be the digi-equivalent of the crisp-packet-rustler down your local multiplex, but there’s no better way to laugh, comment and discuss the intricacies of Joe Exotic’s mullet en masse.Online rendezvous: With many Hollywood films getting early digital releases, a number of stars are hosting interactive events.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites.

The service’s rivals, such as Amazon’s Prime Video, with an estimated 118 million users, and Disney’s new streaming service, also benefited from new users. Disney+ only launched in the UK and other western European markets in February, and has already doubled its global subscriber base to 50 million.Such has been the demand for streaming services that Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube and the BBC’s iPlayer agreed at the start of the lockdown to reduce the speed of their streams across Europe to ensure broadband networks could cope with significantly higher usage.Netflix is among Wall Street’s so-called Faang stocks, the most popular and best-performing US technology companies. The acronym also includes Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google.Amazon and Netflix investors have shrugged off concerns about the effect of the pandemic on Netflix’s scripted TV and film production in the US, which have been paused.Meanwhile, ExxonMobil and other oil giants, including the UK firms BP and Royal Dutch Shell, have seen their share prices tumble as demand slumped to the lowest level in 25 years.The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned the biggest oil production cuts in history would not be enough to offset the huge fall in demand, to levels not seen since 1995, even if travel restrictions are eased in the second half of the year.Earlier this month ExxonMobil announced it would reduce its spending by a third this year, a reduction of $10bn, as it scaled back plans to cope with the fall in global oil prices.

We were there for 10 days before lockdown and then had to make a tough decision: prioritise the band or be with our loved ones. Ultimately, we agreed on being in the studio indefinitely. I think the situation brought out a new side in us. There’s a tendency for everyone to be constantly joking, but it forced us to be more considerate and open. But then we were told we had to leave. Now, there’s complete uncertainty and we’re all in different parts of the country, trying to make a music video.I don’t know how we’ll manage being in different places. Some vinyl records need to be signed by all six of us. The sheer logistics of trying to organise that … Our fanbase is super-engaged, so we’re trying to find means of maintaining that connection that isn’t, like, “Oh, we’re on Instagram Live again today.” We have a WhatsApp group where fans can share stories – stuff like that spurs you on. The jazz keyboardist lives in London with the producer Maxwell OwinMaxwell and I have been trying to make some music together for ages. We rarely have a week where we’re both at home, so now it’s easy. I’ve seen a lot of people posting about the pressure to be creative, but that pressure is always there. People just distract themselves by doing things like gigs and touring.The DJs and producers live in rural New Hampshire with their partner, BrookeDrew: We’re in a log cabin, surrounded by trees and a river. It’s beautiful. We’re all trans here and we’re in a relationship: me, Maya and our partner, Brooke, so we look after each other. I’m the most scared for my friends who are alone. When I first came out and I was trying to be a woman and exist in public spaces, the only places I got validation for who I was, at first, were within the very small dance music community. So if the only people who use correct pronouns and see your struggle in this world are the people that you’re connected to through music and then you’re isolated, no one is creating that support system around you for who you are. It can get dark.That’s one of the reasons we’ve been doing livestreams from our backyard. We’re trying to do one thing a week to give people some access to music and community. We’ve done DJing guides, and we want to start a conference to discuss them. Maya and I have been joking about starting a synth-pop band. But we do so much together, it’s important to go it alone sometimes.Octo Octa (Maya Bouldry-Morrison): It’s hard to say that isolating is nice, but I am happy to be here. We work as a unit pretty often. When Eris and I are on the road, we’re attached at the hip. There is a lot of melding of personalities and becoming one person, in a certain sense, when you’re having to travel together, play together, and that somewhat carries over to home. But we have two different studios in the house, so we work on music separately, and then Brooke does visual art.When we first came home from tour, I got a bunch of stuff done really quickly. I put out a mixtape I put some finishing touches on an EP. And then my motivation kind of started dipping. I’m staying positive by doing all the things I’ve been waiting to do around the house – I get to throw away old roofing tiles that have been sitting in the basement since 1989. Quarantine is not for ever. It eventually ends, and then new things will come. Four members of the Glasgow-based glam-pop band share a flatDave (synths): There’s six of us in one flat: me, James, Finlay and Charlie from Walt Disco Ali plays drums for Lucy and the Best Boys and Anna is the singer of Medicine Cabinet. My bedroom has turned into the performance space and the four of us are in it all day. We all gave up on having personal space a long time ago. We actually filmed a music video for our next single, Cut Your Hair, in the flat on our iPhones. It feels like the best thing to be putting out now.James (frontman): I share a bed with our bass player, Finlay. Charlie, the guitarist, sleeps on the couch. The only problem is in the morning when everyone wants to shower. People in bands are suited to being in isolation because they spend days in cramped spaces without doing much exercise. We’re lucky, because we were meant to be writing a debut album anyway, and being stuck in quarantine with your band means that you don’t have any other option but to do it. We weren’t in the best financial position, so we applied for the Help Musicians’ Coronavirus Hardship Fund, and that’s been a massive help. We got really drunk and made a trap song one night with the other two housemates – but we haven’t formed a supergroup yet.The band from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who make music using discarded junk, are stranded in UgandaPisko Crane (bandleader): We’ve been stuck at our label Nyege Nyege Tapes’ studio in Kampala, Uganda, away from our home in Kinshasa. We were supposed to be here for three months to record our album, but then the country shut the airports. It’s difficult to be away from our families but we’re used to working under tough conditions. Music is really helping us in confinement.Our band name means “trash music” in Lingala. We’re used to going and looking for new materials to make instruments and getting inspiration from the environment. But we have made a song for coronavirus and also we’re making costumes and masks to ward off the virus. Even in the time of corona, music has an important role to play.Australia’s pub-rock punks live together in MelbourneAmy Taylor (singer): There’s four of us in a three-bedroom house and Declan, the guitarist, sleeps in the shed. It’s just like being on tour, except we’re not playing any gigs. Today, I did a two-hour walk, a half-hour boxing class on YouTube, half an hour of yoga, and another half-hour walk. I haven’t felt like doing much music stuff – everything was cancelled, so it’s kind of devastating. But because I’m always working, it’s been nice to step back.I’ve been reading Patti Smith lyrics books and getting some inspiration from places that I wouldn’t usually look. Before this, I hadn’t read a book since Captain Underpants. I feel like every band’s gonna make an album about being stuck inside, and I don’t really want that. But the lockdown probably will change us a little bit. I know the boys have been twiddling on guitar during the day, so they’re probably going to get better at their instruments. I don’t think we would write a Covid-19 song, but you never know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1edcd3963c46db9ff168afffeb2c92d3f4dd2510/0_121_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=798ed5ffc118be2d970d8992c3a8952b","title":"how saudi arabia religious project transformed indonesia islam","story":"The world’s largest Muslim-majority country was long considered a tolerant place. But thanks to Saudi money and influence, it has taken a sharply conservative turn. By  Krithika VaragurHalf a million people, all dressed in white, radiated from the Hotel Indonesia roundabout in central Jakarta. Protesters clogged the streets for a mile in every direction they went all the way up to the National Monument and beyond it to the presidential palace. It was 4 November 2016, and they had come on buses, planes and on foot, from all across Java and even from some other islands, to participate in the largest Islamist demonstration in Indonesian history.“We came to the palace to enforce the law,” said the cleric Rizieq Shihab, to rapt silence. “Desecrators of the Qur’an must be punished. We must reject the leaders of infidels,” he said, referring to Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the Chinese-Christian governor of Indonesia’s capital city, who is known as Ahok. “If our demands are not heard, are you ready to turn this into a revolution?” “We’re ready!” screamed the crowd, breaking into huge applause. “God is great!”, they shouted. There were cries of “Kill Ahok!”It was an odd scene in Indonesia, which is the world’s largest Muslim-majority country but is not really a “Muslim nation”. Officially, it is a multifaith country that protects six religions equally, where race and ethnicity have been tacitly elided from political discourse. An overtly Islamist political protest like this had no precedent.In theory, the rally was organised by the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), led by Shihab, to accuse Ahok of blasphemy against Islam and call for his removal from office. But in practice, this was less about Ahok and more about displaying the piety and political power of Muslim Indonesians – and it worked. The city shut down all its major arteries that day. At the second protest, on 2 December, the president of Indonesia himself showed up, unannounced, and prayed with them.FPI’s campaign was more successful than it could have dreamed. The following April, Ahok lost his bid for re-election as the governor of Jakarta a month later, at the end of a show trial, he was sentenced to two years in jail for blasphemy. The 4 November rally turned out to be a turning point for political Islam in Indonesia. The next presidential election was waged largely on the terms set by the events of 2016: both candidates played up their Islamic credentials. Today, the vice-president of Indonesia is a man who was once the nation’s chief Muslim cleric.But Shihab is not enjoying the fruits of his labour in Indonesia. He lives, instead, in Saudi Arabia. After the Jakarta gubernatorial election, he became embroiled in a sexting scandal when an arrest warrant was issued, he fled to Mecca. Though it is almost 5,000 miles away from Indonesia, the kingdom is a natural choice of refuge for Shihab, because his Saudi ties date back three decades. He graduated from the Islamic and Arabic College of Indonesia, or Lipia, a university in Jakarta built, funded and fully subsidised to this day by Saudi Arabia. His studies at Lipia paved the way for further education in Riyadh, where he forged enduring networks with Saudi clerics.As the largest Muslim-majority nation and a developing, postcolonial state, Indonesia has been a prime recipient of the full spectrum of Saudi proselytisation – known as dawa, the call to Islam. And while investments peaked in absolute terms at least a decade ago, as they did in most of the Muslim world, their effects continue to reverberate. Saudi investment in Indonesia has at turns fuelled jihadists, helped consolidate the country’s leading Islamist political party and produced dozens of influential ideologues. The Saudi soft-power apparatus in Indonesia is unrivalled, including Lipia, a large embassy and a powerful, standalone “religious attache”. Saudi charity has also paid for thousands of poor students to go to school and university, and helped rebuild devastated regions such as Aceh after the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004.The influence of Shihab’s organisation and vision is just one example of how Saudi dawa has shaped modern Indonesia. Another is the Bali bombings of 2002, which killed 202 people, mostly tourists, in the world’s most deadly terror attack after 911, and which woke Indonesia up to the danger of terrorism within its borders. The attacks were planned by a circle of al-Qaida-affiliated jihadists based at the al-Mukmin Islamic boarding school in Central Java, which was founded with an initial endowment from the Saudi king in 1972.Beyond such flagship investments, an equally pervasive legacy of Saudi proselytisation in Indonesia has been the rise of virulent religious intolerance. In addition to the commonplace harassment of Christian groups and the show trial of Ahok, its most prominent Christian politician, Indonesia is also now a country where there is a national “anti-Shia” league and mobs have driven Ahmadiyya Muslims from their homes into refugee camps.It’s not for nothing that when Barack Obama, who spent five years in Jakarta as a child, returned to Indonesia in 2011, he remarked on the “more fundamentalist, unforgiving interpretation” of Islam he now observed in the archipelago. He attributed this to Saudi influence. What Obama was picking up on was the concept of Arabisasi – ambitious in theory and even more influential in practice.Arabisasi was one of the first Indonesian words I learned after I moved to the country in 2016. It’s a neologism meaning, as you might expect, “Arabisation”. But the concept was used in reference to a whole class of developments in Indonesia: the rise of political Islam, blasphemy prosecutions, the growing popularity of hijabs and burqas, new mosques, louder mosques, new schools, the persecution of religious minorities. Above all, it referred to the relatively new, central role for Islam in the cultural and political life of a big democracy that was, until 1998, a tightly controlled military dictatorship. The underlying claim was that five decades of Saudi Arabia’s religious influence in Indonesia was responsible for all these things.Regardless of how true or false this was, the phrase itself pointed to a generalised anxiety over “Saudi money”, in Indonesia and the world. It seemed to explain how a tropical archipelago supposedly famous for its tolerance was, by the time I got there, caught up in a culture war over everything from the acceptability of Santa hats to dating, a safe haven for hardline Islamists, and even the home of a few hundred people who joined Islamic State.Saudi Arabia’s global export of Wahhabism – a puritanical and intolerant movement founded in the 18th century that foregrounds a literal reading of the Qur’an and seeks to eradicate “deviant” regional traditions – has been discussed frequently in the post-911 world, where religious conservatism is often considered synonymous with extremism and terrorism. But the actual effects of Saudi proselytisation are poorly understood. It’s not just “the Saudi government” that spreads Wahhabism international Saudi actors include universities, an Islamic Affairs state ministry, several state-adjacent global charities such as the Muslim World League, one-off regional relief efforts and independent businessmen.Dawa literally means to call or invite, but in practice it covers the wide range of proselytisation activities available to any Muslim person or institution. Today, there is official Saudi dawa in two dozen countries, and unofficial activity in many more. Its effects are not straightforward. For instance, Saudi dawa typically ends up promoting not Saudi Wahhabism, but Salafism, a linked but discrete 20th-century revivalist movement, originating in Egypt, that seeks to return to the traditions of earliest Islam. Saudi proselytisation tends to cultivate a learned Salafi class of scholars and ideologues who then go on to shape their local religious landscapes. Another common outcome is the violent intolerance of Shia and Sufi Muslims, as well as minority sects such as the Ahmadiyya and other religions such as Christianity. The most notorious effect has been the spread of Salafi-jihadism, which has found a base in some of the communities supported by Saudi dawa.The Saudi dawa project has been an effort to systematically shape the Muslim world, and Muslims in the world, in its image. In its ambition and global reach, it is unparalleled. It is also chaotic and full of contradictions: Saudi efforts both support and work to counter Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated political Islamists, or simultaneously fund shady charities and counter-extremism centres that work within miles of each other.Saudi Arabia didn’t single-handedly cause the conservative turn in Indonesia, not by a long shot. But what I learned in three years was that it has indeed contributed to it in all sorts of ways. When I travelled through much of the Indonesian archipelago, from Aceh to Sulawesi, I was surprised by the Saudi campaign’s scale and precision in its targeted outreach to regional leaders. What struck me, too, was the characteristic Saudi vision of combining aid and proselytisation. The line between the two was always blurred.Islam came to the Indonesian archipelago around the 13th century, likely through Arab traders, and the powerful rulers of Java and Sumatra gradually converted from Hinduism or Buddhism to Islam. The islands of what is now Indonesia belonged to a larger archipelagic Muslim medieval world that included parts of modern-day Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Cambodia.Indonesia is still home to the world’s largest Buddhist temple – Borobudur, in Central Java – many Hindu temples, millions of Christians who converted under colonial rule, and rich mystical and animist traditions. Many of these elements have coloured Indonesian Islam, which is not liberal exactly, but is still tolerant of many folk practices. To give just one example, there is a shrine in Central Java, on Mount Kemukus, which Muslim pilgrims climb to have sex with other pilgrims, who are complete strangers, above a graveyard, to bring good luck. The rite, which includes elements of Javanese myth and esoteric Hindu Tantra, could only exist in Indonesia.After Indonesia became independent in 1945, “Indonesian Islam” faced a high-stakes test: would the new country be Islamic? Would it enforce sharia? Ultimately, the founding fathers decided that it would not. But out of these vigorous postcolonial debates emerged a man named Mohammad Natsir, who would go on to almost single-handedly establish Saudi influence in the archipelago. Natsir was a pious Islamic scholar from Sumatra who became the first prime minister of independent Indonesia. In 1958, he joined an unsuccessful rebellion against the founding president Sukarno and went into exile deep in the Sumatran jungle for three years. When he emerged, he was promptly jailed. And when he was finally allowed to return to civil society in 1966, he was ignored and shunned by the new Suharto military dictatorship, which had just come to power through a violent, CIA-backed coup.When the Saudi monarch King Faisal first visited Indonesia in 1967, he was deeply impressed by Natsir. At the time, Faisal was developing his vision of a Saudi foreign policy driven by al-tadamon al-Islami, or “Islamic solidarity.” He opened the kingdom’s taps to Natsir, who promptly created Dewan Dakwah Islamiyah Indonesia (DDII), the Indonesian Islamic Dawa Council, which became the chief conduit for Saudi money into Indonesia. Natsir’s personal diplomacy won him an open-ended tazkiya, or recommendation letter, from Mecca to accept donations from any Saudi source.Today, DDII is housed in an eight-storey, star-shaped building in Cikini in Central Jakarta, called the Dawa Tower. It still has offices in 32 of the 34 provinces of Indonesia. But active Saudi funding has dried up, and its revenues now come from the properties it owns through its charitable endowment. More than four decades after its founding, DDII has “both lost and won”, says Ulil Abshar-Abdalla, a Muslim intellectual who lives in Jakarta. The organisation itself is less influential and well-funded than in the 1980s and 1990s – but its ideas are now ensconced in the mainstream.While DDII has always been administered by Indonesians, another important node of Saudi influence in Indonesia is staffed entirely by Saudis: Lipia university in South Jakarta. Lipia is the most visible outpost of Saudi dawa in Indonesia, and it is one of the greatest accomplishments of the peak dawa era worldwide. It is a bricks-and-mortar university completely administered by Saudis, and to this day overseen by the Saudi embassy. The university’s website entices applicants today with free tuition, a monthly allowance and opportunities to pursue graduate degrees in Saudi Arabia. The classes are all conducted in Arabic. There is barely any Indonesian text visible on campus, even on signs. There are female students, but they study on a separate level from the male students and watch video lectures that are live-streamed from the male classrooms downstairs. Lipia has lately been trying to recruit more female instructors to change this, but as of 2019 they were still outnumbered at least three to one.As one might expect, the books of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of Wahhabism, have always been a key part of Lipia’s curriculum. But the curriculum was never purely Wahhabi, and in the 1990s, Lipia became a hotbed of Muslim Brotherhood-oriented political Islamists (as opposed to pure Salafis, who are apolitical). That’s why the university became a prime recruiting spot for the Prosperous Justice party (PKS), which is modelled on the Muslim Brotherhood and is Indonesia’s most successful Islamist political party. Some of Lipia’s most influential alumni are members of the modern PKS, including former party president Hidayat Nur Wahid. Lipia’s evolution makes it a microcosm of the multifaceted Saudi dawa project, harbouring both political Islamists and quietist Salafis – as well as plenty of poor students who just jumped at the chance for a scholarship.One of the unlikeliest places where Salafism has thrived is Batam, a rather seedy resort island in a special duty-free economic zone, just across the bay from Singapore. The island has little to recommend it beyond tax-free shopping and cheap bars, but in the last 10 years it has also become home to a prominent Salafi radio station called Hang Radio and multiple Salafi boarding schools. I visited one of the schools, Pesantren Anshur al-Sunnah, in Batam’s main Salafi neighbourhood of Cendana, in 2017. Its facilities are bare bones, but it educates more than 150 students from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The school’s director, who studied in Medina on a scholarship, would only speak to me through a partitioned room, because he would not be in the presence of a woman who is not a relation.In Batam’s busy downtown, Hang Radio runs an impressive office and recording studio. The station is decades old, but it took a religious turn in 2004 when its owner, a local businessman named Zein Alatas, became a Salafi in a fit of mid-life piety. Now, it broadcasts 20 straight hours of religious content every day, including sermons by visiting clerics. In 2016, the island rejected 418 passport applications from residents who were suspected of intent to join Isis Hang Radio was cited by local authorities as a factor behind the convicts’ increasingly radical views.Today, Saudi dawa in Indonesia is decreasing in absolute terms the Philippines is now its major target in south-east Asia, according to annual reports of the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawa and Guidance. But Indonesian institutions have adjusted. After DDII’s Gulf funding dried up, it was replaced in part by politicians such as Prabowo Subianto, a military general turned cabinet minister, who funded DDII throughout the 2000s. It is through such resilient institutions that Saudi influence survives. Every Saudi national could leave Indonesia tomorrow and there would still be a vibrant Salafi ecosystem in place.Yet even though many Indonesian Salafis are standing on their own feet, there is still a tendency among Indonesian Muslims to idealise the traditions of the Gulf. Despite their great numerical advantage – there are more Muslims in the archipelago than in all the Gulf states combined – ideas rarely flow in the opposite direction. Indonesia’s Sunni Muslim establishment has, over the last few years, tried to project “Islam Nusantara”, or “Islam of the Archipelago”, on the world stage, but it remains ideologically muddled, and leans on platitudes such as “moderation” and “tolerance”.As a result, Saudi Arabia’s image retains great power in both the religious and non-religious spheres. Indonesian Salafi clerics frequently cite Saudi scholars in their rulings, and nearly all ordinary Muslims save up to visit Mecca and Medina. Within Indonesia’s thriving Islamic-capitalist consumer economy, products depicting Mecca’s Kaaba shrine, from clocks to calendars, are ubiquitous. I once bought iced tea from a woman in Manado, in North Sulawesi, whose hijab was simply embroidered with the word “Saudi” in cursive script: kingdom as brand and logo.Amid this general good will, Saudi Arabia has started to tweak the way it presents itself in Indonesia. The first Saudi ambassador I met in Jakarta, Osama bin Mohammed al-Shuaibi, in 2017, had a stern manner. Dressed in the traditional flowing thawb and checked red headdress, he grew angry when I asked him about the role of Wahhabism in Saudi diplomacy, and railed against what he saw as Iran’s meddling overseas. But his successor Esam Althagafi, whom I met a week after his appointment in 2019, was both more forthcoming and more westernised. He wore a crisp navy suit and tie, and spoke perfect English.“The way we see it, Indonesia is a member of Vision 2030,” Althagafi told me, referring to the plan by Muhammad bin Salman, the 34-year-old Saudi crown prince, to ersify the kingdom’s economy away from oil and develop sectors such as health, culture and tourism. “We’re looking at the country’s economy,” Althagafi said. “Not just religion.” He even entertained my questions about Saudi proselytisation – while his predecessor was guarded, the new ambassador admitted that it was at the heart of the two countries’ relationship.” But today, we have nothing to hide,” he said. “Everything we do here, from Qur’an competitions to Ramadan iftars, is at the request of Indonesian Muslim groups.” Of course, Islamic affairs remain a priority, Althagafi told me. But he pointed out that the Saudi embassy was now ploughing resources into Arabic language programmes in Indonesia, positioning itself, in that respect, alongside cultural organisations such as the British Council and the Alliance Francaise.Given the obscure ways in which Saudi dawa has operated in the past, this change in rhetoric is notable. But there is very good reason to be sceptical about Vision 2030, which has been criticised for being economically unfeasible and for papering over human rights issues in order to burnish bin Salman’s image. It is hard to believe in the supposed reformist promise of the prince and Vision 2030 when, midway through the publicity campaign in 2018, the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered in a Saudi consulate.It will take at least a few years to determine whether the Saudi role in Indonesia has truly shifted. What is certain, though, is that over the past half-century, Saudi dawa has never been one fixed thing. Maintaining an ossified image from 10 or even 20 years ago is the biggest obstacle to understanding how Saudi money – and Saudi soft power – work today.• Adapted from The Call: Inside the Global Saudi Religious Project by Krithika Varagur, which will be published by Columbia Global Reports on 21 April• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb04114fe4a9443e2a7f3abc4fa79bfc039eb29/94_90_2966_1780/master/2966.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a61eae18c2cb1d0c3c0521f016044d5","title":"why have the uk and germany taken different approaches to covid 19 testing","story":"In February, the UK and Germany were taking a similar approach to testing for coronavirus.

It will be very hard to know to what extent this has happened, without a parallel investment in new data.“For a host of reasons, it’s possible that the number of EU citizens granted status through the scheme could greatly exceed the current official estimate of 3.4 million but that wouldn’t necessarily mean the task is finished.”The campaign group the3million said it had concerns that some of the more complex cases were now taking up to six months to resolve, creating anxiety for many families whose lives were put on hold.It also expressed concern over the lack of information about refusals.“We have gone from ‘nobody is being refused status on eligibility grounds’ to hundreds of refusals per month, without knowing why cases are being refused,” said Maike Bohn, one of the group’s co-founders.“The real question is how many people have not applied, and the government simply doesn’t know it. Every single EU resident to miss the deadline of 30 June 2021, for whatever reason, will automatically lose their legal status in the UK. It is crucial we know how many, who, and where they are – but we have no data that would allow us to establish this.”The data puts Polish citizens at the top, with 665,000 applicants, but it has been estimated previously there are about a million Poles in the country. Some returned home after Brexit.Romanians are the second highest number of applicants by nationality, at 564,300, followed by Italians at 351,600 and Portuguese at 273,000.The Home Office said there was still more than a year left until the deadline and if someone had reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they would be given a further opportunity to apply.It also pointed out that the scheme would open beyond 30 June 2021 “not just for those with reasonable grounds for applying late, but also to accommodate those granted pre-settled status, who will be able in due course to apply for settled status, and close family members living overseas at the end of the transition period (and children born after that date) who later join a resident EEA or Swiss citizen here with status under the scheme”. • This headline and first paragraph of this article were amended on 16 April 2020 to clarify that 3.4m was the number of applications received this is not necessarily the same as the number of people who have applied for settled status."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c2705e0d3da0358f495ce0478a7a2a1c48a4fce/0_0_1799_1080/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c45add79401d76aa6f6911b5e84d370","title":"slimmed down virtual house of commons to sit next week","story":"Up to 50 MPs will be in the chamber and 120 online via Zoom, despite security worriesA slimmed-down “virtual House of Commons” featuring ministers in the chamber being questioned by MPs via video link is set to convene next week after Commons authorities agreed to the idea.The scheme, the first time part of the Commons will have sat remotely in its 700-year history, will allow up to 50 ministers and backbenchers to physically be in the chamber at any one time, with up to 120 appearing on screens. Those in the Commons would sit at a distance from one another to minimise the risk of transmitting coronavirus.The video-conferencing element will use the US-made Zoom system, despite worries about its security. The House of Commons commission, which made the announcement, said the National Cyber Security Centre had advised Zoom would be usable “if the installation and the use of the service is carefully managed”.The House of Lords is also scheduled to hold remote sittings from next week, a subsequent statement from the upper house said, using Microsoft systems.MPs are due to return from the Easter recess at 2.30pm on Tuesday. The new system will not take effect immediately, as the measures will first need to be approved by some MPs physically sitting in the Commons. This would mean one of the first new-style events could be prime minister’s questions at midday on Wednesday.The virtual sittings will only be in place for the first two hours of each day, taking in questions and statements. Once the system is seen as working well, the hope is to extend it to debates and legislation.No decision has yet been made on remote voting, which MPs would have to decide on.The statement explaining the new working methods said that while up to 50 MPs could be in the chamber at any one time, it was expected that fewer would attend, and that they would be encouraged to work at another location if possible. If an MP is in the Commons they will only be called to speak if listed to do so, as is the normal procedure.Screens will be placed around the chamber to let the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and MPs in the chamber see and hear their colleagues. A new rule dictates that those appearing via Zoom “will be expected not to display or draw attention to objects to illustrate their contributions”, so as not to give any advantage to remote speakers.In the event of a technical failure that prevents an MP from being heard, they will be called later if possible. When the virtual system is being used, there will be no interventions or points of order to interrupt speeches.Similarly, in the Lords peers will only be able to ask ministers questions, and to listen to and respond to ministerial statements and private notice questions, and contribute to non-legislative debates. For now, again, debates on legislation will be limited to physical settings.The Lords is next due to sit on Wednesday.The Commons commission, which is responsible for the administration and operation of the chamber, is chaired by Hoyle. Other members include Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, his Labour shadow, Valerie Vaz, and Pete Wishart of the SNP. The commission statement said the hybrid model “was developed at speed and chosen as an achievable first step towards a virtual parliament, having the benefit of meeting current technological capacity”.In a statement, Hoyle said he wanted MPs and staff to remain socially distanced and not attend parliament unless necessary.“By initiating a hybrid solution, with steps towards an entirely virtual parliament, we are enabling members to stay close to their communities, while continuing their important work scrutinising the government,” he said.“I do not want members and house staff putting themselves at risk. By working virtually, this is our contribution to the guidance of stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.”Rees-Mogg said the measures would help parliament scrutinise the executive, authorise spending and makelaws, “all of which are essential to tackling coronavirus”.He added: “I am extremely grateful to Mr Speaker, for showing the leadership necessary to make this happen to the parties, who have worked together constructively to ensure next week’s business will run smoothly with the minimal necessary attendance in Westminster and to house staff, for working so hard over the Easter break to make these changes technically possible.”Efforts are being made to minimise the number of staff who will need to be at Westminster, and no visitors will be allowed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f38c31eaf1bce655181d2b0adc8768a36d0840/0_157_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb8f9d6e89eb85f229050c6faab5cec","title":"tell us how is life in lockdown affecting your gambling","story":"Are you gambling less?

He has lived in Paris for several months, where his talent has blossomed to world elite levels.His speciality is one-minute bullet chess, at which he beat Carlsen on 2 April in an informal first to 100 wins match. At very fast speeds manual dexterity is important, and some blamed Carlsen’s defeat on his using a mouse while Firouzja was quicker using finger touch.Wednesday’s final was at Banter Blitz, where players comment verbally on their moves during the game. The time limit was three minutes per player per game, without the one-second or two-second per move increment which is normal for three-minute blitz. Again Firouzja was noticeably faster. He won two games on time and in another Carlsen escaped by checkmating with just 0.2 seconds to spare. While Carlsen kept up an articulate running commentary throughout, Firouzja, whose English is weaker, made fewer early comments and was usually ahead on time after the opening.Carlsen was the heavy favourite following his impressive 9-0 semi-final win over the strong Russian Sanan Sjugirov, whereas Firouzja had struggled to defeat the Indian Srinath Narayanan 9-6. But in the final Firouzja was sharper, continually producing tactical tricks which rarely gave his opponent the classically controlled games where he dominates. If there is a historic parallel to this match, it would be the world title matches of 60-70 years ago where David Bronstein and Mikhail Tal also used their combinative ability to disrupt Mikhail Botvinnik’s strategic rhythm.This weekend sees the start of the $250,000 Magnus Carlsen Invitational, the richest ever online tournament and planned as a showpiece for the world champion’s skills. After the events of 2 April and this Wednesday, however, the Invitational has suddenly become a battlefield for survival for its originator.One can excuse Carlsen’s defeats at bullet and blitz as significantly an effect of the playing conditions and time limit which favoured Firouzja, but the Invitational has rapid time controls, 15 minutes per player per game plus a 10 seconds per move increment.Back in December Firouzja had Carlsen close to defeat at the World Blitz and won the silver medal behind Carlsen in the World Rapid, but next month at Wijk aan Zee at slower time limits the established elite defeated the teen. Four months further on, and Firouzja is clearly improving as fast as Bobby Fischer or Garry Kasparov did in their teenage years. So the stakes will be high at the Invitational and especially next Monday. Another success for Firouzja and much of the chess world will view him as the heir apparent to Carlsen’s throne.First round pairings starting at 3pm this Saturday, are Carlsen (Norway) v Hikaru Nakamura (US) and Firouzja v Ding Liren (China), followed on Sunday by Fabiano Caruana (US) v Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia), Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) v Anish Giri (Netherlands). Monday at 3pm is a time to remember as Carlsen and Firouzja meet over four rapid games."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b60c9c8412be7cd803732b8dbc42423e5945f5dc/0_159_4787_2874/master/4787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11a5582e69eca6a90ad2538fa5cdea72","title":"golf returns in june with first four pga tournaments behind closed doors","story":"The PGA Tour will boldly attempt to deliver mainstream sport from mid-June after announcing a revised schedule that includes an initial four events without spectators.

After Texas, the Tour plans to head to South Carolina, Connecticut and Michigan in successive weeks for closed-door tournaments. The overriding aim is to complete a reduced, 36-event season by the time the Tour Championship finishes in September in Atlanta.“We see changes and developments being made in the world of testing, available tests. We’re following very closely, through the assistance of our expert medical advisers, the development of more large-scale testing capabilities, more rapid-response type tests, whether it’s through finger pricks or testing for antibodies.“We obviously are aware that the Food and Drug administration recently approved use of a saliva-based test. It gives us confidence that we will be able to develop a strong testing protocol that will mitigate risk as much as we possibly can. We know that there will also be further developments over the next eight weeks before we were to resume play.”The Open Championship has already been cancelled and golf’s other three major tournaments – the Masters, US PGA Championship and US Open – moved to new dates between August and November.“We are aware, obviously, that for a sports fan in general there is a thirst for live sports in our country, I assume around the world. But we’re not rushing back to satiate that desire. We are simply announcing a resumption of our schedule. We’re only going to do that when we are sure that it will be safe and responsible.”Existing travel restrictions are, for now, pertinent. The Tour estimates at least 25 players – Tommy Fleetwood and Shane Lowry for example – and 35 caddies are presently outside the US. Officials have suggested tournaments could continue without such players, with that taken into account in terms of future Tour status and eligibility of international members."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a2a0961b6df47baee852ac24296640766559569/0_80_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a845ae8a63be160530c3e735767e7a5","title":"world rugby sends 80m coronavirus relief fund to national unions rugby union","story":"The Rugby Football Union could face further multimillion pound losses after World Rugby revealed that despite extensive contingency plans to save the 2020 Test calendar, the worst-case scenario is that “no international rugby is possible this year”.The RFU is already forecasting losses of £50m over the next 18 months but that is on the basis that England’s four November matches, against New Zealand, Tonga, Argentina and Australia, take place.On Thursday, however, World Rugby announced that while it is hopeful that all Tests will be played, the global game’s governing body is also planning for a scenario in which the international schedule is scrapped.On Thursday World Rugby also announced an £80m emergency fund for the unions, but while the RFU intends to take advantage of the rescue package, its share (around £8m) would not cover what would be a huge shortfall if the November Tests are called off.As things stand England are due to tour Japan in July but it is inevitable the trip will be called off and Sweeney has already suggested they could travel to Japan in October instead.

Nick, 55, from Nottinghamshire writes: “A lot has been written about holidays abroad, most of which are covered by insurance, but what about holidays in the UK? I’ve booked and paid in full for two self-catering breaks, one in May and another in July. As with many people who book accommodation-only, I didn’t take out insurance. I’m about £1,000 out of pocket as both companies are refusing to refund me, even though I paid the full balance long before I had to. They are only offering to defer the date but that is only helpful if I can get the time off work and the accommodation I originally booked is available. What is the best course of action?”Several readers have asked about self-catering holidays in the UK that have been cancelled due to the lockdown. Are they entitled to a refund? While the Package Travel Regulations extend to package holidays in the UK, they do not cover accommodation-only bookings. Each accommodation provider has its own terms and conditions. Since quarantine, the majority have updated their terms to offer a change of date or credit note instead of a refund. Frustratingly, most providers are advising guests who want a refund to claim on their holiday insurance, even though, like Nick, few people take out insurance for a UK holiday. For Nick, the best, in fact the only, course of action is to accept the postponement and hope the companies he booked with will be flexible with new dates. The same advice applies to anyone with an accommodation booking: the only option is to contact the provider directly.Examples of companies offering credit notes or flexible booking include: Under the Thatch, a collection of holiday cottages mostly in Wales, which has introduced a flexible booking policy allowing anyone with a cottage stay due to start before 1 September 2020 to postpone to a later date in 2020 or 2021. Most property owners with accommodation on Sawday’s and Canopy and Stars websites are also offering to change the date of the booking – or provide a credit note for a future booking. For cottages, bookings up to 22 May can be transferred for up to 12 months. It is not accepting new bookings before 4 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/491c9ec4dfb8d5a01ea51d4935697d08f41bd016/0_243_4437_2663/master/4437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d7690d1115ed34eb387acb1de99987a","title":"my favourite travel photo by readers","story":"From stunning beaches to New York’s finest, our tipsters reminisce about holidays past through both words and picturesMy daughter Iris is fearless, especially around water.

Elizabeth GowingWe’d visited Etosha national park before, but had rushed from one waterhole to the next. This time, we decided to spend a whole day at Okaukuejo waterhole. While tourists loaded in to safari vehicles, we sat and watched. Herds of springbok and zebra gave way to jackals hunting and playing. They were joined by a rhino and giraffes. Shortly before midday, over 20 elephants suddenly appeared, and rushed into the water like excited teenagers. The safari vehicles hadn’t returned from their searches, so it was just us (well, and one other couple) and the elephants. Magical. Frances ValdesOn a budget trip to Japan with my sisters and brother-in-law, one night in Osaka we stumbled into this tiny bar. The place was charming but, without any menus, we were afraid of falling into the classic tourist trap of spending a fortune. Several times, the kind, aged bartender explained we were in a nomihodai. The problem was, we didn’t know what that meant. We cautiously ordered one drink each and – on his insistence – a glass of sake. He was so hospitable and tried to serve us food and more drinks but, still uneasy, we politely declined. It was only afterwards we learned that a nomihodai is an all-you-can-eatdrink bar. We could have stayed there for hours!Sarah CollingsI took this in Gambia after our taxi broke down in the middle of nowhere. We had to walk a mile to the nearest village to find a mechanic. The local children found our breakdown quite amusing. This had been a special day, travelling cross-country to see chimpanzees and hippos in the wild. So although we missed our ferry back, the day will stay with me for a long time.Richard GabrielThis is my daughter Lucia (aged 14) in the sea at Peniscola, near Valencia, in 2010. The photo sums up that holiday – hot, watery and very Spanish. Every day we would gather at our apartment poolside bar, where all the holidaying locals in their swimwear would drink cold wine, eat seafood tapas and smoke. There were very few British tourists but a number of French and Germans. In the town there was a wonderful cafeteria called Los Jubilados run by retired ladies who served vast plates of arroz negro and chipirones at ridiculously low prices. It’s a beautiful place to visit, particularly in the summer heat.Simon WilliamsTo celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary in August 2016, we invited a crowd of family and friends to join us in West Sweden – many of whom had been with us when we married on the beach on the island of Orust. We live in the UK but visit my husband’s native land as often as we can. The day we visited the island of Tjörn to jump from the ing tower at Stockevik was perfect, sunny and warm. Heaven!

My family really put this assessment to the test when within 10 hours of arriving my dad’s long-term medical condition had flared up. This precipitated a mad rush to get him on the last night ferry to Islay, through the tail end of Hurricane Dorian. From Islay hospital he was airlifted to Glasgow (and apparently fed chips en route by the paramedics). He returned in good health to the tranquillity of Jura, where members of the population of 188 showed the full extent of their hospitality and generosity. He thereafter received innumerable free ferry trips and enquiries after his health (it seems gossip spread remarkably fast!).CoraWalking along the Southbank, I came across this shot. I loved the juxtaposition of a typical beach scene, including someone drinking from a fresh coconut, with the City of London as a backdrop. This image perfectly illustrated the ersity and ingenuity of this wonderful capital city.Chris PatersonI was backpacking solo in Asia when I found myself on Kho Phangan in Thailand. After a crazy beach party night, I was astounded by the beauty of this island, which is mostly famous for its parties.Christos Spyropoulos"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d02578fea3acabc59bbd13e887196ae350d0218e/0_1058_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2100e81f8f3f64cb89510117ca0a74f","title":"steph mcgovern the steph show tv presenter at home broadcast","story":"With baby banished to the bedroom and a lawnful of TV equipment, The Steph Show presenter fears the programme might go on being broadcast from her house for everChannel 4 had grand plans for The Steph Show. Scheduled to launch in mid-spring, it was set to be the keystone of the channel’s daytime schedules – a bright, buzzy magazine show fronted by rising star Steph McGovern, newly freed from the clutches of the BBC. Shot live from a prime slab of Leeds waterside real estate before a lively studio audience, The Steph Show was gearing up to breathe life into the channel’s fusty daytime output. And then the coronavirus happened.“I’m just at Asda,” McGovern tells me over Zoom. “I had to queue for 45 minutes to get in.” She finished recording her ninth episode three hours ago, and has come straight from the studio to buy baby milk for her five-month-old daughter. And when she’s finished, she will head straight back to the studio to feed her. Because things have changed, and now she hosts The Steph Show from her house.In what sounds like an incredibly frantic few days last month, Channel 4 scrapped its original plans for The Steph Show, brought the launch date forward by three weeks and decided to film it in McGovern’s ground floor. An engineer visited her house for a feasibility assessment. Cameras were hooked up on fixed rigs around her house. Satellite trucks positioned themselves on her lawn. She filmed a trailer, holding up placards Bob Dylan-style from behind a window. They rehearsed on Sunday. The next day, the first show aired.“It was incredibly fast, but everyone wanted to get it on air. It was one of those things where we’re all in it together,” McGovern says. “I mean, the lawn is going to be wrecked,” she adds ruefully.Incredibly, the show works. McGovern wanders around her house (more of which later), chatting to celebrity guests over Skype, checking in on families who are attempting to adjust to the new situation and finding experts to discuss the practicalities of life under lockdown. Last week, she attempted a cookery segment, with the Cold Feet star Fay Ripley bravely attempting to instruct her remotely on how to make mac and cheese. McGovern botched it, but kept returning to the dish to grab a mouthful over the course of the next few minutes, the same way you or I might. For anyone stuck by themselves at the moment, it must feel like dropping in on an old friend.“That’s exactly how we wanted it to feel”, says Channel 4’s head of daytime, Jo Street, whose decision it was to bring the series forward. “Steph does feel like an everywoman. She’s the girl you want to have a beer with, or go for a coffee with, or be mates with. For a massive part of our audience, that is the job that she’s doing every lunchtime.”Indeed, it’s hard to see how this would work had anyone else been in the driving seat. If a big name had presented a daytime show from their imposingly large house, viewers would have been instantly alienated. But McGovern’s house, although beautifully designed – her integrated kitchen banquette has already become something of a national talking point – is basically a normal-sized family house. The living room, dining room and kitchen are all essentially the same thing, and you could probably walk from one end to the other in less than 10 seconds. Her partner and baby have to hide in a bedroom during the broadcast. McGovern says that her daughter “tends to sleep through the show. That’s how much she cares about it.”The main thing, she’s finding, is locating the balance between family home and television studio. “Keeping it tidy is the big thing,” McGovern says. “A lot of viewers have said to me: ‘How come your house is so clean?’ I’m like: ‘Because it’s on telly.’ I’ve got a bit of a routine of an evening. We have our dinner and then, once everyone goes to bed, I just whizz around and try and sort it out. We have a deal. My partner does the cooking and I do all the tidying.”And yet, despite all this, there’s more to McGovern than her everywoman persona would suggest. Before being poached by Channel 4, she had been BBC Breakfast’s lead business presenter for a decade. Before that she was a producer, in charge of the business news for the BBC’s one, six and 10 o’clock bulletins. At the age of 19, during an apprenticeship with Black \u0026amp Decker, she devised a new production technique that saved the company £150,000 a year. When Have I Got News For You decided to continue filming remotely without an audience, she was the first choice to host. In short, she knows her stuff. And this extends to her plans for the direction of The Steph Show.“I’ve learned that I want real people to be the focus of it, and that’s what I want to keep driving through,” she says. “Yes, it’s lovely to have some celebrities on, but, for me, what’s better are people like the blood biker volunteers we had on yesterday. Or the 14-year-old girl who lost her hands when she was a baby and can now play piano because she learned it in lockdown. I know it sounds cheesy, but that’s what I think is going to make this show good.”“Public service broadcasting is not just news and current affairs,” adds Street. “It’s about connecting to an audience when they need you. Steph was really passionate about that.”It all sounds lovely, but these are uncertain times. Without wanting to get any darker than necessary, I have to ask McGovern about contingencies. Her show is called The Steph Show. It’s filmed from her house. Hopefully it won’t, but what would happen if she finds herself becoming ill?“We’ll have to see if Stephanie Cole is available,” she shrugs. “Do you know what? Nobody has an answer to that. I have not got a clue what we would do. If I wasn’t too ill, then I would like to think I would try to carry on in some capacity. If I got really ill, someone else could do it. I’m not precious about it. Johnny Vegas seems to be appearing a lot. I might ask him if he could.”So successful is The Steph Show in this new form, in fact, that I wonder whether this is perhaps how it should always be. Broadcasting from her home gives the show such a ramshackle and intimate quality that it already feels as if the show’s voice has been found. Has anyone considered abandoning the studio and carrying on like this after the lockdown lifts?“Yes. Sure,” scolds Jo Street, sarcastically. “Because this is such an easy way to make a television programme.” McGovern also admits that continuing like this for ever is her “biggest fear”, but then adds that the current set-up is bound to inform the show when it is broadcast as intended. “Or maybe I could just recreate my entire house inside the studio,” she ponders. “I might just go full-on Alan Partridge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31b6bf61b8cbd167c52620ef26200f0f37dfcb90/0_56_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aced4ccb05a13b3383c1af173c34ffa","title":"13000 absent from uk armed forces due to coronavirus","story":"Thirteen thousand members of the armed forces are absent from duty because of coronavirus, largely because they are self-isolating, looking after other family members or otherwise having to work from home.It is understood that fewer than 100 service personnel have tested positive for coronavirus, the first time for three weeks the department has given any indication of how far the disease is affecting the armed forces. Previously it said there were fewer than 10 cases.Labour has called for the government to publish data on how many service personnel have been tested, amid concerns that the British armed forces could fall victim to an outbreak of the type that has affected the US and French navies.Responding to the latest figures, John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, said: “These concerning figures make Labour’s case for greater protections and more testing of forces personnel even stronger. Our armed forces keep us safe. It is vital we do the same for them.”Nearly 600 sailors serving onboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier tested positive for coronavirus, and one died, after an outbreak got out of control in the confines of the warship. More than 600 cases emerged on the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. Britain’s Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier is due to take part in an sea training exercise off the coast of the UK later this month, with a crew of around 600 onboard.The MoD has been reluctant to release statistics about how many armed forces personnel have been tested or how many forces personnel are ill or absent from duty, at a time when the government as a whole is under pressure over whether it is able to test NHS and social care staff.Forces personnel have voiced concern about the lack of testing in suspected cases, while soldiers placed on standby have complained they are being housed in barracks conditions, where social distancing is not always practised, particularly during training.Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff, said that around 3,000 forces personnel were helping to carry out a number of frontline tasks in the UK, including 200 working in the ambulance services, as well as assisting the emergency delivery of protective equipment, oxygen and ventilators for hospitals.Engineers and planners were increasingly becoming involved in the desperate efforts to expand the UK’s coronavirus testing capability. Carter said that armed forces were looking at developing prototype “pop-ups, like mobile libraries” to provide testing services to care homes and remote communities.“The military is involved in trying to construct that and create prototypes that could be let out to industry in short order,” Carter said. Defence scientists at the Porton Down lab in Wiltshire were also “providing valuable help to testing and the way testing will be conducted in the future”, the forces chief said.The MoD has tried to adopt a relatively low profile during the coronavirus crisis, and where it has been deployed it has largely sought to do so away from the public eye. Insiders insist that they do not expect soldiers to be deployed to protect public order.“Our role is very much in support of the heroic healthcare workers on the frontline,” the general added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8b700a33d020cabf6f1edce09ad66d7fb3e0e32/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05b534322dceb616619defd9e104dd42","title":"angela merkel draws on science background in covid 19 explainer lockdown exit","story":"German chancellor excels in describing epidemiological basis of lockdown exit strategyIn her 14 years as Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel’s straight delivery and aversion to rhetorical grandeur has been a frequent bugbear for journalists and party colleagues longing for a more passionate line of communication between the head of government and the public.Yet in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, even her critics have come to appreciate a politician who is on safer ground explaining the importance of decimal places than projecting great visions of the future.Merkel’s explanation of the scientific basis behind her government’s lockdown exit strategy, a clip of which has been shared thousands of times on social media, had all the calm confidence expected of a former research scientist with a doctorate in quantum chemistry who once co-authored a paper on the “influence of spatial correlations on the rate of chemical reactions”.Explaining why her optimism about a flattening of the infection rate needed to be circumspect and an exit out of the lockdown required caution, the 65-year-old rattled through a model calculation.Figures show the virus in Germany to have a reproduction number of one (R1), meaning on average one person goes on to infect one other person.Without measures to slow down the spread of the virus, such as physical distancing, scientists believe Covid-19 to have a reproduction number of two to three.If the reproduction number of one were to go up to 1.1, Merkel explained, the German health system could be overwhelmed by October. If it were to go up to 1.2, hospitals could reach a crisis point in July, and if it went up to 1.3 the crisis point would come in June.Merkel’s calculation, which came at the end of Wednesday night’s press conference, has received more attention abroad than in Germany, where the public is accustomed to the strengths and weaknesses that come with her scientific training.Lothar de Maiziére, the last East German premier who recommended Merkel for her first role in politics, has said her scientific background made her an outsider in a political arena dominated by men with law degrees, but also enabled her rise.“She knows that for every effect there has to be a cause and maybe also ideal conditions,” he told the Merkel biographer Evelyn Roll. “She knows the laws of formal logic and is therefore capable of building logical chains with speed and determination.”Was there anything politicians could learn from scientists, one German journalist once asked her. “Gravity,” Merkel responded. “Without mass, no depth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cb568861a11cafee2e8210c14caf53f333c7a1c/0_275_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2998ccbe4c1c80f7f0cde782543a0deb","title":"as coronavirus spreads around the world so too do the quack cures","story":"Politicians, faith leaders and other authority figures have been touting dubious remediesIn India, politicians from the ruling Hindu nationalist BJP party have been touting cow urine as a cure for Covid-19. In Tanzania the president has promised that taking communion in church would “burn” the virus away. In Brazil a congressman claimed a day of fasting would halt its spread.And the leader of the most powerful country in the world, Donald Trump, has been touting as a miracle cure an unproven anti-malarial drug that has contributed to at least one death.There have also been dubious claims about technology. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced it had invented a device that can detect coronavirus at a distance of 100 metres, using a magnetic field and “bipolar virus”.And in the UK, Eamonn Holmes, the presenter of ITV’s This Morning, said “many people are rightly concerned”, about conspiracy theories linking the roll-out of 5G mobile phone networks to coronavirus, while insisting he did not believe in the hoaxes himself.As the global pandemic has worsened, politicians, faith leaders and other authority figures from around the world have touted unscientific methods to tackle its spread.There are already countless coronavirus-related quack cures, dubious prophylactic schemes or conspiracy theories circulating on social media.But endorsements from influential men and women mean people are much more likely to take false confidence from unscientific cures. At best these are unproven, at worst some may even exacerbate the virus’s spread.“Cow urine parties” in India brought hundreds of people together to drink the liquid that some Hindus believe has medicinal properties. A BJP party worker in Kolkata, Narayan Chatterjee, was arrested for organising a cow urine consumption competition just as scientists were warning people to avoid large gatherings.Tanzania’s president, John Magufuli, halted all international flights over Easter, and closed schools and universities and brought in quarantine for visitors.Religious gatherings of all faiths and denominations have repeatedly proved a vector for infections, even as the most devout insist their faith and God will protect them, with congregations often following their leaders’ guidance to meet.In Israel cases soared in the ultra-orthodox community as much as four to eight times faster than elsewhere in the country, after its leaders dismissed government regulations.The most senior ultra-orthodox rabbi, Chaim Kanievsky, had initially refused to close packed synagogues and religious seminaries. “The Torah protects and saves,” the 92-year-old said, only in late March relenting and making a call to lone prayer.In Brazil, Marcos Feliciano, a rightwing pentecostal preacher and congressman, promoted an anti-Covid “day of abstinence” on Sunday 5 April, claiming the fasting would produce a miracle to heal Brazil.It was sanctioned by Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, whose response to the coronavirus crisis has been denounced as reckless, paranoid and anti-science. Like Trump, he has touted the unproven drug hydroxychloroquine.Authorities in the Indian state of Kashmir have focused on 10-15 million poplar trees, which they argue “may prove fatal to the public health” by causing hay fever, and have ordered large-scale felling as part of anti-Covid efforts.Every April the trees shed cotton-like balls officials say these could cause allergies, with the resulting sneezing and coughing spreading coronavirus. Doctors have questioned this, while activists and conservationists warned the felling would damage the environment and local economy.A more ostensibly hi-tech response came from Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, which claimed its new device only needed to be placed in front of coronavirus for five seconds to detect its presence.Traditional and herbal medicine have been promoted by authority figures around the world, to the consternation of their own governments, world health bodies and even social media firms trying to tackle fake news.In Venezuela, where the crippled health system was barely coping before coronavirus, the authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro, suggested on Twitter that lemongrass and elderberry tea could ward off Covid-19. His message was deleted as part of Twitter’s campaign against coronavirus misinformation.Another leader to receive a very public reprimand for peddling confusing information is Madagascar’s president, Andry Rajoelina, who recently announced tests on a supposed plant-based “remedy” specific to his country, that he claimed could “change the history of the entire world”. He gave no details.He has previously been warned by the World Health Organization against making claims about alternative treatments.And the makers of Hennessy cognac warned Kenyans against believing it would protect them from Covid-19 after the governor of Nairobi, Mike Sonko, urged people to drink alcohol and included bottles of cognac in food handouts for the vulnerable. An Indian cabinet minister, Shripad Naik, claimed Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, had recovered from coronavirus with the help of Ayurvedic cures. The prince’s spokesman rejected the reports and said he followed NHS medical advice.In Nigeria, the health minister, Osagie Ehanire, was forced to mobilise after the traditional ruler of the kingdom of Ife claimed a combination of plants including onions, African pepper and neem tree were effective against Covid-19, and said the pandemic had been foretold in June last year.Ehanire warned that government approval was needed for any treatment, and traditional medicines needed to go through the same scientific tests as all drugs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The total number of coronavirus cases across the world has reached at least 2,090,110, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic.The US has the highest number of cases with 640,291, followed by Spain, with 182,816. The number of cases of coronavirus registered globally passed 1.5 million on 9 April.The UK’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson as he recovers from Covid-19, confirmed the extension following advice from the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage).Raab said: “The government has decided that the current measures must remain in place for at least the next three weeks.”He said Sage had advised that “relaxing any of the measures in place” would “undo the progress we have made” and would “risk damage to both public health and the economy”.There were 861 Covid-19 deaths in UK hospitals reported on Thursday, taking the total past 13,000.More than 22 million American have lost their jobs in the last four weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the US.The US labour department announced that another 5.24 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, making a total of 22.2 million since 14 March, when nationwide stay-at-home orders led to an unprecedented wave of layoffs across the country.The largest number of people to ask for unemployment benefits in a four-week period before the Covid-19 crisis came in 1992, when 2.7 million sought support.Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, said the country had succeeding in flattening the infection curve but that a “more extensive surveillance regime” needed to be implemented if they were to forge “the road out” of lockdown.He praised the extensive testing and contact-tracing system in place and the actions from states to open testing to anyone with symptoms. But he cautioned: “We need to do even better than that … so when we move to a less restricted environment, we can identify outbreaks very quickly and respond to them.”Europe owes Italy “a heartfelt apology” for not offering assistance when the country was suffering in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, the head of the European Union executive said.Speaking at the European parliament, commission president Ursula von der Leyen said truth was needed to overcome the pandemic, including political honesty. She said: “Too many were not there on time when Italy needed a helping hand at the very beginning. And yes, for that it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology.”Governor Andrew Cuomo has extended the New York state shutdown to 15 May. He also announced that starting on Friday, anyone aged two and older would be required to wear face coverings in public if they cannot socially distance.Another 606 people have died from the virus in New York, the lowest figure in 10 days, bringing the total above 12,000 in the state.Economies in Asia will see zero growth this year for the first time in 60 years, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. It warned that the global economy would face the “worst recession since the Great Depression” and that Asia’s service sector in particular will struggle to rebound.Changyong Rhee, director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific department, warned that governments would need to take extraordinary actions as a result. Rhee said: “This is not a time for business as usual. Asian countries need to use all policy instruments in their toolkits.”Singapore reported at least 728 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, the biggest jump yet in numbers in the city-state, which had fought hard to keep its outbreak under control.Singapore had been praised by the World Health Organization for rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and surveillance measures, which had previously mitigated the spread of Covid-19. But the disease has begun spreading rapidly within the large migrant worker community that Singapore relies on to staff many of its basic services, highlighting what rights groups say is a weak link in containment efforts.Japan has expanded its state of emergency to cover the entire country.Shinzo Abe, the country’s prime minister, told a special meeting of medical experts called to discuss the disease: “Areas where a state of emergency should be carried out will be expanded from the seven prefectures to all prefectures.”According to AFP, the declaration allows regional governors to urge people to stay indoors, but with no punitive measures or legal force the measure is weaker than strict lockdowns seen in other parts of the world.Facebook will begin showing notifications to users who have interacted with posts that contain “harmful” coronavirus misinformation, the company announced.The new policy applies only to misinformation that Facebook considers likely to contribute to “imminent physical harm”, such as false claims about “cures” or statements that physical distancing is not effective. Facebook’s policy has been to remove those posts from the platform.Under the new policy, which will be rolled out in the coming weeks, users who liked, shared, commented or reacted with an emoji to such posts before they were deleted will see a message in their news feed directing them to a “myth busters” page maintained by the WHO."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2256f29e00c8c9aaa5e72c40c89c94402398c557/0_0_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c83103b5fd026f17f998b49161455f74","title":"deferred paying your mortgage credit card debts","story":"One in nine households is taking a mortgage holiday.

Average pay levels for British workers only returned to pre-financial crisis levels after inflation at the end of 2019, taking 12 years to repair the damage from the last recession.Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at the investment platform AJ Bell, said: “The UK went into this crisis with a chronic savings deficit, with many households having little to no savings to fall back on if they saw their income hit.“It means that any drop in income will have an immediate effect on lots of households, particularly if there are no big cutbacks they can make, and we’re already seeing the impact of this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1526b337205b6c4be8c5367baae47cfe3b6d0917/0_59_1186_711/master/1186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3a58eb8a133cd55830f30efef79fce","title":"uk lockdown to continue for at least three weeks raab confirms","story":"Government says measures must go on because it is not clear whether the virus has peakedDominic Raab has warned the public that lockdown measures could last into June as ministers came under increasing pressure to set out a detailed plan to ease the stringent restrictions.Setting out plans for a minimum three-week extension to prevent a deadly “second peak” of infections, Boris Johnson’s stand-in said that any relaxation now would “substantially increase the number of deaths”.And dispelling any hopes that the conditions would be lifted entirely before the May bank holiday, he said that there could be ongoing local lockdowns well into the summer to avoid new hotspots emerging. Raab said ministers had received “very clear advice” from Sage, the expert scientific committee advising the government, that lifting restrictions now would risk a damaging second wave of infections, which would “substantially increase the number of deaths”.“It would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.”His announcement came as ministers faced new calls to explain how they intend to control the virus so that the lockdown can eventually be relaxed – with one adviser, Neil Ferguson, breaking ranks on Thursday to call for a “single-minded emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing”.He said the government needed to accelerate action as it had with Brexit and argued that a huge infrastructure of testing and contact tracing would need to be in place in order for the lockdown to be lifted without further peaks.“Without that, our estimates show we have relatively little leeway. If we relax measures too much, then we will see a resurgence in transmission,” he told the BBC’s Today programme.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, reacted to the criticism testily, saying Ferguson “advises government. He is not in the government.”When pressed for a timescale on lifting restrictions, Raab pointed to Boris Johnson’s remark of a month ago, on 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to “turn the tide” of the virus. “That, broadly, is the outline,” Raab said. The UK is now in its fourth week of lockdown.Raab set out five conditions that would need to be met before any loosening of the rules. These included a sustained fall in the daily death rate, and confidence that the supply of PPE and testing can meet future demand.In a rebuke to rightwing commentators arguing for the lockdown to be lifted to alleviate the economic costs of having businesses shuttered and workers furloughed, Raab added that “early relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period”.Rather than lifting the restrictions, Raab talked of “adjusting” them, adding: “It could mean relaxing measures in some areas, while strengthening measures in some other areas”. A Downing Street source called the approach “keyhole surgery”.He stressed that while the infection rate had fallen in the community, “we have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes”.Hancock promised more testing and protective equipment for care home staff on Wednesday, with many reporting inadequate supplies and haphazard advice from the government.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed the extension of the measures. “I fully support the government’s decision to extend the lockdown,” he said. ‪“The priority now must be to ensure we see a ramp-up in testing, that staff get the PPE they desperately need, and that more is done to protect our care homes from the virus. We also need clarity about what plans are being put in place to lift the lockdown when the time is right.”Raab was deputising for the prime minister, who is convalescing at Chequers after being hospitalised with the virus. Downing Street said Boris Johnson was not involved in the decision to extend the restrictions, but that Raab had updated him by phone.One Tory MP said it was “rightwingers in cabinet and the wider party” who were pushing for an early exit from the lockdown, but that No 10 was highly cautious.A senior Westminster source with knowledge of the government’s thinking said they believed a move towards contact tracing conducted by an army of trained people was about to become “the next big U-turn”. Previous reversals of government policy include the acknowledgement of the need for mass testing, the abandonment of the herd immunity strategy, and the realisation that an antibody test was harder to develop than first thought.Another change of heart could be over the wearing of masks by members of the public. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty said this was “a very live issue that we are re-examining”. He said there was medical evidence of a “small” effect on the transmission of the virus.Advisers had previously suggested there was little benefit to wearing masks, but Whitty said: “The point about scientific advice is, it evolves.”The chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, also hinted at ongoing measures, saying the challenge was to get R – the transmission rate of the virus – below 1 and keep it there. “There may be a number of measures that need to be continued to allow that,” he said. “There will be some changes that need to take place, around things like home-working.”Hancock will come under pressure to commit to a coordinated testing and contact tracing regime when he appears before a blockbuster select committee hearing on Friday, led by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt and attended by several other committee chairs as guests.Hunt has long been pushing for a mass testing and tracing strategy, which was dismissed by the government’s experts in mid-March when they moved from a policy of trying to contain the virus to trying to delay its peak.At that point, on March 26, Dr Jenny Harries said testing and contact tracing was “not an appropriate mechanism as we go forward”, despite the World Health Organization’s exhortation to “test, test, test”.The government has since conceded the point on mass testing and begun to develop an app that can help trace contacts. However, there are concerns that online tracing will not be effective at reaching older people, that it is voluntary, and that privacy concerns may hamper its usefulness.

You can keep up with all the latest developments from around the world on our global liveblog.NHS workers stand outside the Aintree university hospital during the 8pm clap to thank Capt Tom Moore, the 99-year-old war veteran who has raised more than £15m for the health service.The UK’s weekly round of applause for NHS workers is to take place in less than five minutes.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, represented the UK in a virtual summit of G7 leaders to discuss the coronavirus pandemic this afternoon. Here is Downing Street’s statement on the meeting:All leaders expressed their best wishes for the Prime Minister’s recovery and welcomed the cooperation that has already taken place between G7 countries. They agreed that the rapid development and production of coronavirus treatments and a vaccine will be crucial to stop the spread of the virus around the world. The First Secretary of State stressed the need for the response to be internationally coordinated. Leaders discussed the particular risk coronavirus poses to developing nations and agreed on the need to fight coronavirus in every country. They committed to continue to support developing countries through bilateral assistance, multinational organisations and by ensuring governments around the world have access to the medical supplies they need. G7 leaders also agreed on the importance of financial measures to defend the global economy against the impact of coronavirus. The First Secretary of State welcomed the efforts that have been made to coordinate economic responses, including agreements on debt relief earlier this week, and urged all countries to support long-term economic recovery.Here are the main points from the press conference.Based on this advice, the government has determined that current measures must remain in place for at least the next three weeks.He said the cabinet and Cobra, the government’s emergency committee, considered the advice from Sage earlier. Summarising what it concluded, he told journalists:There are indications that the measures we have put in place have been successful in slowing down the spread of the virus.But, Sage also say that it is a mixed and inconsistent picture and, in some settings, infections are still likely to be increasing.Sage assess that the rate of infection, or the R value, is almost certainly below 1 in the community.That means that on average each infected person is, in turn, infecting less than one other personBut, overall, we still don’t have the infection rate down as far as we need to.As in other countries, we have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes.In sum, the very clear advice we have received is that any change to our social distancing measures now would risk a significant increase in the spread of the virus.That would threaten a second peak of the virus, and substantially increase the number of deaths.It would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.We have been very clear that we will take the right decisions at the right moments based on the evidence. And they may well involve a transition out of the current measures. And, of course, they could be calibrated in different ways.He also said that Boris Johnson’s claim on 19 March that the UK would be able to “turn the tide” in the fight against coronavirus within 12 weeks was still realistic. Raab said:The prime minister said at the outset that it would take three months to come through the peak and I think that, broadly, is still the outline.(Presumably, then, this would be another transition period that No 10 would hope to be over by the end of 2020.)First, we must protect the NHS’s ability to cope ...Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from coronavirus so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.Third, we need to have reliable data from Sage showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.Fourth, we need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.Fifth, and this is really crucial, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS.It’s not a trade-off here, if we get a second peak it’s not just damaging for people’s health and public safety, we will also end up back in a second lockdown which will prolong the economic risks.Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, made the same point. He said:At the moment this is not a tension between the economy and health, it’s very clear what we need to do now, which is to keep this down, stop this from coming back again, stop a second wave, which would need a second lockdown.There will be some changes, I think, that will need to take place, that have already taken place, around things like home working, that are going to be important to maintain that ability to break transmission.This is something we are very keen to get extremely clear. We’ve asked Public Health England to look at this in some detail and then what we really want is, if we see any signal at all, we want to then know what next we can do about it to minimise risk.Nicola Sturgeon has asked that people continue to make “difficult sacrifices” and adhere to Covid-19 restrictions in order to save lives.Speaking after the UK government’s Cobra meeting, Sturgeon said: If we were to lift any of these measures now, we would risk an immediate and potentially exponential resurgence of the virus. And that could result in our NHS being quickly overwhelmed.It could result in even more cases in our care homes, and it would also mean much more loss of life. It could of course also lead to the reintroduction of even more stringent restrictions in the future and substantially more damage to the economy.As a result, in short, all of the progress we have achieved together in these last few weeks, through high compliance with the lockdown restrictions, would be lost.CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn has said businesses will support the extended lockdown because public health is the main priority.At the same time, extending restrictions will bring serious challenges for many companies. The government’s lifelines for business will matter more than ever. In particular, it’s vital that the Job Retention Scheme starts delivering cash to struggling companies next week, as HMRC is working hard to achieve.Firms also need urgent clarity on the scheme’s duration. When scientific evidence shows it’s safe to do so, eyes will turn to how the lockdown can be lifted. To build public trust and the right action, many voices will need to be heard, from health experts and political leaders to business, unions and local communities.It’s not too early to start to plan, cautiously, and with public health paramount, for the revival of our economy.The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the decision to continue the lockdown was agreed by all four UK nations.I along with the first ministers of Scotland and Northern Ireland attended the UK government’s Cobra meeting. We each confirmed our decisions that the current restrictions on movement to protect the NHS and so to save lives should continue for another three weeks.I know that the last three weeks have been very difficult for many people. I want to thank everyone in Wales for the way each of us is dealing with these challenging circumstances.While we have seen some positive signs in the data, it is still too early to change course in dealing with this deadly virus. Many more lives are at stake, and too many families have already lost loved ones.Nevertheless, the decision to extend the lockdown is not one that has been taken lightly. But I am clear that we cannot risk throwing away all the sacrifices we have made here in Wales over the last few weeks by lifting the restrictions too soon. That could mean more deaths and, in the long run, even greater impact on people’s jobs and livelihoods."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4230846.1587073149!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert exams could run until early september","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDiscussions are taking place over plans for schools to resume teaching for sixth-year students for two weeks ahead of the start of the Leaving Cert. File photograph: David SleatorThe Leaving Cert may end up finishing in early September with just a single exam each day under plans to minimise public health risks, according to senior education sources.In addition, the possibility of the new school year beginning later than normal - with the staggered return of classes over the course of a number of weeks - is being explored in talks between Department of Education officials and education partners.Weekly meetings between the department, teachers’ unions, school managers and other stakeholders are being planned between now and the end of May to discuss these details.Sources have cautioned than discussions over the timing of the exams and the return of school are at an early stage will be guided by public health advice.A number of sources say the possibility of starting the Leaving Cert exams on July 29th and running them until about September 2nd is being explored.Under a revised timetable, the biggest exams with the largest numbers of candidates would take place towards the start of the exams, such as English, maths and Irish.Papers with the fewest number of candidates would take place towards the end of the exam period.This would help speed up the delivery of results by facilitating the marking process for large exams to begin in early August, say sources.The idea behind holding a single major exam each day is to minimise the chances of students interacting or breaching social distancing rules in between exams.However, this would significantly extend the exam window. Last year, for example, more than 30 exams were held over 15 days. Sources say draft plans for this year could see exams held over about 26 days or more.Leaving Cert students who progress to third-level education are likely to begin their courses as late as November this year.Best-case scenarios Several third-level institutions have confirmed that they plan to admit first-year students in either late October or November under best-case scenarios.The exact dates will depend on the timing of the exams, the duration of the marking process, and how quickly results and offers can be provided to students, according to well-placed sources.“We’re looking at November at the very best,” said one higher education source, who declined to be named. “This is assuming everything goes smoothly and that timeframes for everything can be compressed.”In addition, colleges are planning to make up lost time during the academic year by cutting short Christmas holidays and reading weeks for first-year students. This should allow them to complete their summer exams as normal.Much of the timings will hinge on the timeframe for the exams and the marking process.Discussions, meanwhile, are also taking place over details of plans for schools to resume teaching for sixth year students for two weeks ahead of the start of the Leaving Cert.Minister for Education Joe McHugh has requested that schools reopen for a minimum of two weeks in July prior to the exams.This would require all teaching staff in secondary schools to be available on the premises.Classes are likely to be ided up into smaller groups for social distancing purposes , according to sources.Further details are also being discussed over plans for school-based tests to replace the Junior Cycle exams.It is likely that exam papers would be delivered to schools and teachers would be required to administer and mark the exams. The results would be incorporate students’ results on students’ Junior Cycle profile of achievement.The likelihood of school year for secondary students beginning later in September is also being explored.Some sources say this could involve a staggered return of classes over the course of a number of weeks.“There is every chance that schools might not have the full complement of students in class until October,” said one source. “However, this all depends on public health advice.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Much has been made of Ireland’s much lower death rate relative to the UK however, both countries compare poorly to best-in-class performers such as Austria or Iceland.Different countries collect data in different ways, all of them subject to shortcomings, it has to be noted, so comparisons carry caveats.There are two main sets of issues relating to the possible under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths. The first relates to the location of death and has grown in importance with the rise in clusters of the disease in nursing homes and other residential centres.Many of these locations, be they hospitals or other residential locations, have well-worn but differing reporting and surveillance mechanisms for deaths, particularly those associated with a disease outbreak.While in some other countries deaths outside hospitals were or are not being recorded, it does appear as a rule that deaths here are being logged regardless of whether they happen in a hospital, nursing home or other location.Residential locationsIn residential locations, this happens as a consequence of the investigation by public health officials of local outbreaks of the disease. By Monday, Ireland had recorded 406 deaths, of which 266 had occurred in a hospital environment. Some 222 deaths, including 187 associated with nursing homes, were linked to other residential sites.The numbers don’t add up because some nursing home patients were transferred to hospital before dying and so may have been counted in both nursing home and hospital categories.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan cautioned this is the “best understanding” of public health officials “at this moment in time” but carries a “small health warning”. The figures refer to registered deaths of patients in community settings, he said.The second issue relates to how a death is recorded on a death certificate. Many older people dying with Covid-19 also have underlying conditions and it is no easy task to determine what they died of, as opposed to what they died with.Some years ago, there was controversy when a whistleblower alleged a hospital was failing to record the CPE superbug as a cause of death for elderly patients who had died. Obviously, it would be of concern if something similar were to happen with coronavirus.‘Index of suspicion’This seems highly unlikely in hospitals but what about other locations that attracted less attention in the early stages of the pandemic and where a realisation of the dangers posed by the virus was slower to sink in?“What I couldn’t assure you is that every person who dies has a test for this particular illness or even with the symptoms associated with this illness,” Dr Holohan told The  on Monday.Clinically, the “index of suspicion” for the disease would be “a good deal higher” than would normally be the case for flu, he added.“We try to give as comprehensive a number as we possibly can,” he later added.But what about suspected cases? People who had not been tested before they died?According to HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry, the doctor filling out a death cert “will give his or her best opinion of the cause of death in the context of a new illness which is lab-confirmed”.From this it is clear our official figures are based entirely on laboratory-tested cases. Eventually, when death certs are filed within the required three-month period, further cases will be logged that add to the figures. The Coroners Service has instructed doctors to swab test deceased patients with respiratory failure or “circumstantial suspicion” for Covid-19, but this has not been happening all the time, internal correspondence appears to show.As a result, there is likely to be some level of under-reporting of deaths.This situation arises with surveillance of many other infectious diseases. Over time, public health officials get around these shortcomings by calculating the excess deaths that have occurred, but this will not be calculable for some time.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ryanair said it complied with regulations set by EASA and WHODispute over fees threatens \u0026lsquoflow\u0026rsquo of vital goods between Ireland, the UK and EuropeDeaths at Maryborough Centre in Portlaoise stark reminder of human cost of pandemicJohn Paul McDonagh (18) died in hospital after being stabbed in Coolcullen MeadowNew school year likely to be delayed, with staggered return of classesNo evidence of deaths being more common in public or private nursing homes, says TaoiseachJoseph Joyce of Coolcullen Meadow in Enniskillen faces three charges in connection with the death of John Paul McDonaghIf UK follows successful New Zealand model, it could help foster all-island approachEamon Ryan claims \u0026lsquothe document is vague on details, and will require a lot more work\u0026rsquoAnticipated public \u0026lsquosurge\u0026rsquo in Covid-19 taking place in nursing homes amid patchy State aidOver 620 new confirmed cases processed by Irish labs, and 95 processed in a German labMinister for Environment confirms Ireland would join countries seeking a sustainable and just recoveryBirth seen as a success in efforts to reintroduce species to Ireland after 100-year absenceTaoiseach says \u0026euro115 million an \u0026lsquoaccurate estimate\u0026rsquo of monthly cost to StateICU admissions fall for second day as Holohan links rise in cases with increased testingChildren of parents who have died from Covid-19 describe grieving in a pandemicVHI, Laya and Irish Life announce refunds and rebates following Government dealChild and Family Agency tells court teenager was under threat of violence from gangStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4230957.1587072407!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"liverpool port detains p o ship on dublin liverpool route","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVolumes of freight have declined in recent weeks in line with coronavirus restrictions in Ireland,  Britain and Europe. Photograph: Getty ImagesA key supply line between the Republic and Britain has been disrupted by the impounding of the P\u0026ampO vessel Norbay by port authorities in Liverpool on Thursday. It is understood the dispute centres around the payment of €689,000 (£600,000) in fees to Peel Ports, owners of Mersey Docks and Harbour Company Limited, the formal name for Liverpool Port. The Norbay is one of three P\u0026ampO operated vessels on the Irish Sea between Dublin and Liverpool. The other two are the Norbank and the Clipper Pennant. The Norbank was loaded and ready to sail from Dublin on Thursday for a passage to Liverpool, but was later stood down and its cargo taken off. Volumes of freight have declined in recent weeks in line with coronavirus restrictions in Ireland, Britain and Europe, from where goods are sourced for Ireland via the British “landbridge”. In a statement P\u0026ampO said it had been “in discussions since this crisis began” with the owners of all of the ports it used “to ensure that we can manage payments while everyone deals with this unprecedented situation”. The ferry company siad it had “asked for flexibility” in terms of time to pay, but “the Liverpool Port refused to respond even though we were committing to full payment”. P\u0026ampO said “the irresponsible and unnecessary actions of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company Limited at a time of national crisis have closed an essential Dublin-Liverpool supply route, which means vital goods will not be able to flow between the UK, Ireland and Europe”.P\u0026ampO Ferries is owned by DP World, a global organisation which had earnings before interest, tax and depreciation of €3.04billion in 2019. In its response Peel Ports said Liverpool played a vital supply role in many key logistics chains, including medical, healthcare and food. It said “customers who refuse to pay their bills put these and other supply chains at risk. Any decision to detain a vessel is always taken as a last resort, and only when there is a significant debt to repay.” Freight forwarding Commenting on the significance of the impounding and the standing down of other P\u0026ampO ships trading with Liverpool, freight forwarding sources said the absence of P\u0026ampO should not cause panic. Sources said there were other companies – Seatruck, Irish Ferries and Stena – still operating on the mid-Irish Sea route to Liverpool and Holyhead. However, hauliers were fearful that the absence of P\u0026ampO even for a short time would affect their capacity to travel through Liverpool. Most of the Seatruck business on the route is for trailers, as opposed to drive-on and drive-off. Many drive-on and driver-off hauliers prefer to take the Liverpool route as they start early in the morning in Liverpool with “a fresh driver and a fresh tachograph” . The Holyhead route, said one haulier, was a shorter crossing, but the Holyhead port was “much further from the bulk of English destinations”.

I do not think that will the negotiating document, I think that will come later.”Mr Ryan said that the job in politics is “to work with people and to aim high together.”Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are hoping to lure in the Greens, independents and smaller parties to increase their Dail numbers from 72 as a majority of 80 is needed. The Green Party has 12 TDs.On the idea of a national unity Government, Mr Ryan admitted that he was not getting a positive response from other parties. “That forces us to look at other options of course.”Dublin Rathdown TD Catherine Martin said the document presented is “remarkably vague and we would be seeing clarity on a variety of issues before we would consider entering talks.”Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, meanwhile, has refused to be drawn on whether he or Leo Varadkar will be Taoiseach of the next government.The two parties signed off on a joint framework document on Wednesday that will be given to smaller parties this week in a bid to convince them to join a coalition government with them.Mr Martin said he and Mr Varadkar have a broad understanding on a range of issues and have respect for each other.When asked who would get to be Taoiseach in the next government, Mr Martin refused to be drawn and said there is no agreement between them.When pressed on who would get to be Taoiseach first, he said: “We have a broad understanding on many issues... I’m not going any further than that. It is not about personalities, it is about the content and subject matter of the programme for government.“Can we get a significant majority of people in Dáil Éireann behind a coherent programme for government that can take us through this emergency and enable the country to recover?“The Dáil is more fragmented than it has ever been historically and that demands that people have to engage and have an obligation to form a government. The country needs a government.“We are in extraordinary times, people are very worried out there and they are very concerned about their health, jobs, incomes and mortgages. In my view that means that we need a solution to try and take the country through.”When asked if the smaller parties refuse to go into coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, he would consider a national government, he said: “A national government becomes an internal auction process very quickly and becomes a recipe for indecision and lack of coherence. Nothing has changed my mind on that.”Mr Martin said it is not feasible to hold a postal vote to allow members to vote on whether a deal between his party and Fine Gael should form a coalition.Under Fianna Fáil party rules, it has to hold a special ard fheis of its 20,000 party members to approve going into a coalition.Mr Martin said a third party is needed to complete the government but the deal must also be voted through by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil grassroots party membership.“That presents challenges giving the prevalence of Covid-19 emergency but we will be engaging with all levels of the party and consulting with all levels of the party. We have already been doing that. Our councillors have been given a copy of the document and I have been speaking to every single councillor in the country.Asked if there will be a postal vote for members, he said: “That’s very challenging. We don’t think that is feasible at this stage but we are looking and trying to devise other ways.“Covid-19 rules out large gatherings so that is something that is exercising us at the moment.” - Additional Reporting PAThe best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4230949.1587071912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord varadkar leads from the front on pandemic republic questions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘I ask people to bear in mind that this is a virus that did not exist three or four months ago. It did not have a name two months ago.’Two weeks on from their alarming surge of Covid-19 related sanctimony and self-importance, a much subdued cohort of confirmed Government cases returned to the Dáil chamber on Thursday afternoon with their coughs considerably softened.The chilling outbreak saw Government Ministers and backbenchers losing the run of themselves entirely during a special session to discuss the coronavirus crisis, refusing to engage and throwing hissy fits at the Opposition for daring to drag their exalted personages into parliament at time of national emergency so they might be asked some important and legitimate questions.The only reminder of that dark day was Josepha Madigan’s defiant bottle of hand sanitiser plonked on the ledge in front of her and a brief reference from People Before Pandemic’s Richard Boyd-Barrett who valiantly refrained from crowing.“I welcome the fact that the Government has accepted the need to answer questions notwithstanding some, I thought, fairly disingenuous condemnations of those of us who thought it was important that this Dáil would sit and that Ministers would be subject to questioning the last time we were here.”This time, the Taoiseach led an impressive about turn from his side. Clearly the hugely negative reaction to the display of slightly sinister silliness – from genuinely motivated opposition politicians, media and general public – prompted a very different approach to the second special sitting to discuss the Covid-19 crisis.Messengers of the PeopleThere wasn’t a whiff of the superior and antagonistic tone which so astonished Opposition TDs the last time. From the beginning of Leo Varadkar’s conciliatory and inclusive opener, it was clear there would be no Government voice telling fellow Messengers of the People that they ought to be ashamed of themselves for doing the job they were elected to do.“I welcome the opportunity to hear from all sides of the House today,” said Leo. “Don’t be afraid to ask the hard questions. If we can answer them we will. If we cannot we will say so but do please understand that in an evolving situation it isn’t always possible to answer all questions in real time. You simply just don’t have all the information and there is so much going on.” This was greeted with a very restrained level of eye rolling from the few deputies across the floor dispersed around the benches at socially acceptable distances.“And do, please , share your ideas as to how we can respond better to this emergency. No party has a monopoly on wisdom and we will need good ideas and good input from all parts of the House.”He also needs good input, wisdom and ideas from at least one part of the House if a new government is to be assembled from two of the three biggest parties (Sinn Féin having been told to self-isolate by the other pair) and a new component drawn from a assortment of highly suspicious smaller parties.But this complicated project wasn’t mentioned much during a debate focused solely on the state of our pandemic republic and how best the authorities can deal with it now and into the future.They need to find a willing victim now. Or perhaps an unselfish, public-spirited partner willing to put themselves out there for the sake of providing a stable government at a very perilous juncture for the country and its people.The main issue raised during the debate was the grim scenario in many care homes around the country, where the rate of deaths is spiralling and the staff and equipment situation is in a bad way.Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty was strong on the issue, standing in for his leader Mary Lou McDonald who has been laid low by the virus. There were good wishes for her speedy return to Dáil hostilities from all sides. There were also good wishes, for a happier reason, extended to Alan Kelly, the new Labour Party leader on his first outing since his elevation.The Taoiseach made copious notes as the questions came thick and fast. He covered one side of a folded up sheet of paper with a closely written, spider-like scrawl (once a doctor, always a doctor) and filled another, and another.Strict time limits He found it hard to keep up with the questions, asked without trace of hostility or political game playing by opposition members. With strict time limits on the length of contributions, the Taoiseach sighed it was quicker to ask a question than answer one “but I want to answer as many as I can”.When the opening statements concluded, the Ceann Comhairle called for questions. More? The Taoiseach waved his crowded pages in the air. “But . . . but . . . I’ve jotted down one, two, three, four . . . ” Plenty to be getting on with before the next batch.There were replies aplenty from the Taoiseach and then his Minister for Health, Simon Harris, on the problems in nursing homes and the reported crisis in some quarters over the lack of equipment.Mattie McGrath clouded the issue briefly with a slip of the tongue which he quickly corrected when calling for more “PE” equipment for nursing homes.Eamon Ryan of the Greens (seen as the man most likely to provide the third leg to the governmental stool even though the Green Party sounds a very long way from any class of a decision) made a wide-ranging contribution, ending with a call for better pay and conditions for care workers and front-line workers in all areas.He too spoke about worries over testing, as did Róisín Shortall of the Social Democrats who spoke about big pharma companies withholding a chemical agent needed for the testing equipment.The Taoiseach had a long, detailed answer concerning two companies she specifically mentioned. “I am learning a lot about the matter, as many people are, and one thing I have learned is that different machines use different reagents,” he began, launching into a dissertation of the different type of machines on the market and how they use different forms of the chemical.Things are changing from day to day. One crisis is overtaken by another and another, he said.“At various points over the past month, there have been shortages of swabs. At different points there have been shortages of testing kits, reagents and laboratory capacity and it’s almost like whack-a-mole” trying to keep up.“So it’s never ever as simple as sometimes represented in commentary.”But still, the word from care workers about equipment and conditions – as related many times on Thursday in the Dáil, did not tally with what the Taoiseach was saying back to the TDs.“I ask people to bear in mind that this is a virus that did not exist three or four months ago. It did not have a name two months ago.”There was praise and understanding for the Taoiseach and the Health Minister alongside the hard questions.They weren’t all satisfactorily answered, but Varadkar and Harris went a good way towards providing transparency and showed a willingness to continue doing it.A very necessary sitting. It’s a pity they had to fight for it to happen.But a good day’s work for all concerned in the Dáil."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4230582.1587059471!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 d%C3%A1il is told the campaign to tame coronavirus making progress","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour leader Alan Kelly TD: Called for a one-off €1,000 solidarity payment to all healthcare workers. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Efforts to suppress Covid-19 are working as the reproductive rate of the virus is now between 0.7 and one, according to Minister for Health Simon Harris.He told the Dáil on Thursday that hospital admissions had also plateaued.Mr Harris said that the reproductive rate which is known as R0 or R naught, could be calculated using four varying methodologies and all of them showed a rate of between 0.7 and one in Ireland.Earlier Taoiseach Leo Varadkar warned that it could take several months to ease all restrictions.As the Dáil met to debate the Covid-19 pandemic Mr Varadkar said he did not know if the restrictions imposed until May 5th could be lifted, but even if they were it would be a gradual process that could take a number of months.Restrictions were imposed on March 27th and extended on April 10th until at least May 5th.Labour Party leader Alan Kelly called for the Government to make a one-off €1,000 solidarity payment to all healthcare workers for their efforts in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.He said that “with the May Day bank holiday approaching, the day in which we honour workers, I propose introducing this payment in the first week of May as a symbolic gesture of gratitude for all the work our healthcare workers have done and will continue to do”.Mr Varadkar warned that even if restrictions were lifted they could be re-introduced if the number of cases and deaths rose again.He added that “only a scientific breakthrough – a vaccine or an effective anti-viral medicine – will truly allow life to go back to being as it was”.He said they would look at how other countries who were two to three weeks ahead of Ireland eased restrictions.The Taoiseach paid tribute to the two healthcare workers from St Luke’s hospital in Kilkenny who died as a consequence of Covid-19. He said it “reminds us how healthcare workers, and other essential workers, put themselves at risk”.Mr Varadkar also offered sympathies and condolences to the families and friends of the more than 400 people who have died as a consequence of coronoavirus in the Republic. He said they were “people, not statistics” with families and friends, lives and stories.Party leaders joined in tributes to those who died and Mr Varadkar and opposition leaders wished Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald well in her recovery from the virus.He said “we’ve been presented with an unprecedented set of challenges. There’s been no rule book . . . as to how this country or any country can deal with a crisis of this nature”.He said they wanted to “honour the sacrifices made . . . by developing a new social contract between citizens and State”.Mr Varadkar also said Ireland was in the top five EU countries for testing with more than 90,000 – or 2 per cent of the population – tested. He added that there would be problems from time to time with testing because of shortages and because there were different reagents for different tests and machines.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said he knew of at least one case where relatives in a nursing home were informed that the Department of Health had told the home it “should not give out information about the number of cases in the home. This information will come out anyway.”Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said the most regrettable thing was that the crisis in residential care settings could have been somewhat foreseen.Nursing Home Ireland introduced restrictions on visitors on March 4th but the department only gave approval 10 days later and that “has proved to be a monumental and fatal error for many of our most vulnerable citizens”. Mr Doherty said they had to improve access to personal protective equipment as 29 per cent of their facilities have not yet received supplies.Staff at Maryborough Centre in Portlaoise, where eight people have died as a consequence of Covid -19, appealed for equipment more than two weeks ago, he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4230341.1587065157!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus china denies allegations pandemic began in lab near wuhan","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            A sign reading ‘You will never beat New York’ is seen in the window of The Penrose during the coronavirus pandemic on April 15th, 2020 in New York City.

Photograph: Hector RetamalAFP via Getty ImagesChina is refuting allegations that the coronavirus pandemic may have originated in a laboratory near the city of Wuhan where contagious samples were being stored.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian cited the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other unidentified medical experts as saying there was no evidence that transmission began from the lab and there was “no scientific basis” for such claims.“We always believe that this is a scientific issue and requires the professional assessment of scientists and medical experts,” Mr Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing on Thursday. “Only with reasonable response can the international community win this fight,” Mr Zhao said. “China will continue to work together with other countries to help and support each other.”China has also strongly denied claims it delayed reporting on the virus outbreak in Wuhan late last year and underreported case numbers, worsening the impact on the US and other countries.The virus is widely believed to have originated with bats and have passed via another animal species to humans at a wildlife and seafood market in Wuhan, although a firm determination has yet to be made. Allegations about a leak of the virus from the lab have been made in the US media without direct evidence.China has reported 46 new cases of the virus, also known as Covid-19, 34 of them brought from outside the country, but no new deaths from the outbreak.China has now reported a total of 3,342 deaths from the virus among 82,341 cases. Around 3,000 people remain in hospital with Covid-19 or under isolation and monitoring for showing signs of the illness or testing positive but not displaying symptoms.Global cases of coronavirus passed the two million mark on Thursday, with 2,064,115 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.The number of people who have died so far in the pandemic stands at more than 137,000.North AmericaCoronavirus deaths in the United States rose above 32,000 on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally, as president Donald Trump prepares to announce guidelines for reopening the economy.The US is the world’s worst-affected country with fatalities doubling in just a week and setting a record single-day increase for two days in a row.US deaths rose by 1,200 on Thursday with many states yet to report. Deaths rose by a record 2,507 on Wednesday.Seven north-eastern states on Thursday extended a shutdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak until May 15th, even as Mr Trump prepared to detail his plan to end the lockdown in the least-affected states as early as May 1st.The US shutdown has crushed the nation’s economy to levels not seen since the Great Depression nearly a century ago as more than 20 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits amid shuttered stores and restaurants.US cases were nearing 650,000 on Thursday and rose by 30,000 on Wednesday, the biggest increase in five days, according to the Reuters tally.Earlier on Thursday, the number of people hospitalised for the virus and related deaths fell to their lowest levels in more than a week in New York state, evidence that the hardest-hit state was controlling its spread, governor Andrew Cuomo.Mr Trump did not back down on his decision to halt funding to the WHO.Elsewhere in North America, Canada’s confirmed number of cases increased by 954 to 28,899 on Thursday. Prime minister Justin Trudeau has said the country’s border restrictions with the U will remain in place “for a significant time” as the two nations fight the coronavirus outbreak.Washington and Ottawa agreed last month to clamp down on non-essential travel while allowing massive trade flows to continue across their long shared frontier.A total of 1,048 people in Canada had died from the coronavirus by 3pm Irish time on Thursday.EuropeFrance registered 753 more deaths from coronavirus infections on Thursday, bringing the total to 17,920, the fourth-highest tally in the world, but the number of people in hospital has declined for a second day running.In another sign that the lockdown put in place a month ago is working, Jerome Salomon, head of the public health authority, said the total of people in intensive care units (ICU) fell for the eighth day in a row, at 6,248, a low point since April 1st.At 17,920 the number of fatalities is up 4.4 per cent over 24 hours, with the rate of increase decelerating again after it has sped up the two previous days.Earlier on Thursday, the WHO’s regional director said Europe is in eye of the storm of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of cases nearing a million, and should move with extreme caution when considering easing lockdowns.“Case numbers across the region continue to climb. In the past 10 days, the number of cases reported in Europe has nearly doubled to close to one million,” the WHO’s European director, Hans Kluge, told reporters in an online briefing. This meant that about 50 per cent of the global burden was in the continent.“We remain in the eye of the storm . . . If you cannot ensure these criteria are in place before easing restrictions, I urge you to re-think,” Mr Kluge said, adding: “There is no fast track back to normal.”Some European countries are beginning to ease some societal restrictions.Deaths in Italy increased by 525 on Thursday, down from 578 the day before, but the number of new cases accelerated sharply to 3,786 from a previous 2,667. The daily death toll was the lowest since Sunday, while the tally of new infections was the highest since Sunday.The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on February 21st rose to 22,170 - the second highest in the world after that of the US. The number of officially confirmed cases climbed to 168,941.There were 2,936 people in intensive care on Thursday against 3,079 on Wednesday - a 13th consecutive daily decline.The virus death toll in Switzerland has reached 1,017 people, the country’s public health agency said on Thursday, rising from 973 on Wednesday.The number of people showing positive tests for the disease increased to 26,732 from 26,336, it said. The government said measures to curb spread of the pandemic were working and announced its timetable for easing restrictions from April 27th.Neighbouring Austria has already announced a partial exit from its own lockdown, while Germany has announced its own small steps out of the lockdown.In Germany, carmakers including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz will restart production at some German factories next week after the country eased restrictions designed to contain the coronavirus outbreak.The number of new confirmed infections there has risen for a second consecutive day - the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases reported 2,866 new confirmed cases on Thursday, bringing the country’s total to 130,450. The daily death toll also rose for a second day, by 315 to 3,569, the tally showed. On Wednesday the reported death toll was 285.Spain reported another substantial increase in daily deaths from Covid-19 on Thursday, taking the overall toll to more than 19,000, but figures from the region of Catalonia suggest the true total could be several thousand higher.The health ministry said 551 people died in the 24 hours to Thursday, up from 523 on Wednesday, bringing the total to 19,130.The overall number of those infected rose to 182,816 from 177,633 on Wednesday, an increase that health emergency chief Fernando Simon said was largely due to increased testing. Most of those newly identified had mild or no symptoms, he said.Spain has tentatively begun to ease a strict lockdown imposed on March 14th, opening up some sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, earlier this week. Shops, bars, restaurants and other social gathering places remain shuttered.Australia and New ZealandAustralia will keep in place restrictions implemented to curb the spread of the coronavirus for at least four more weeks, prime minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday.Mr Morrison said Australia will over the next month expand testing, improve its capacity to trace contacts of known coronavirus cases, and plan a response to any further local outbreaks.Mr Morrison said these three steps will be finished within four weeks, and Australia will then review the restrictions that include curtailing the movements of residents, and the closures of schools, restaurants and pubs.New Zealand reported just 15 new cases of coronavirus on Thursday as prime minister Jacinda Ardern began outlining what restrictions imposed during a strict four-week lockdown might be eased from next Wednesday.Politicians will make a final decision on Monday on whether to proceed with easing the restrictions.Under Ms Ardern’s plan, primary schools would reopen but attendance would be voluntary, and some business could reopen, including drive-through and delivery restaurants. Shopping centres and retail stores would remain closed and large gatherings banned.New Zealand has reported 1,401 cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths. The number of new daily cases has dropped significantly over the past 11 days.AsiaCoronavirus outbreaks across the Middle East threaten to shatter the lives of millions of already destitute people in conflict zones, and could fuel socio-economic upheaval, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Thursday.Curfews and lockdowns imposed as public health measures to stem spread of the virus are already making it difficult or impossible for many to provide for their families, it said.The Geneva-based agency, in a statement naming Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Gaza, Lebanon and Jordan, called for authorities in the volatile region to prepare for a “potentially devastating aftermath” and a “socio-economic earthquake”.The number of the coronavirus deaths in Iran was below 100 for the third consecutive day on Thursday. Health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV that 92 more people had been recorded as dying from the virus, bringing the total death toll in the country to 4,869. The ministry had reported 94 deaths on Wednesday. Iran’s total number of cases has reached 77,995.Israel has reported more than 12,500 Covid-19 cases and 140 deaths, with unemployment rates rising above 25 per cent.Japan has expanded its state of emergency to cover the entire country. Shinzo Abe, the country’s prime minister, told a special meeting of medical experts called to discuss the disease: “Areas where a state of emergency should be carried out will be expanded from the seven prefectures to all prefectures.”According to AFP, the declaration allows regional governors to urge people to stay indoors, but with no punitive measures or legal force the measure is weaker than strict lockdowns seen in other parts of the world.Singapore’s outbreak has jumped more than 1,100 cases since Monday. It had looked to be successful in containing a first wave of infections, but the new cases are occurring among workers from poorer Asian countries who live in crowded dormitories and work in the tiny city-state’s trade-dependent economy.AfricaMore than one million coronavirus tests will be rolled out in Africa from next week to address a gap in assessing the number of cases on the continent, the head of the African Union’s health body has said.Africa has suffered in the global race to obtain testing kits and other badly needed medical equipment. While the number of virus cases across the continent was above 17,000 on Thursday, health officials have said the testing shortage means more are out there.South Africa, the most assertive African nation in testing, has carried out close to 80,000 tests so far, director of the Africa centres for disease control, John Nkengasong said. South Africa has reported 2,506 people infected with the coronavirus and 34 deaths. – AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4230728.1587064261!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk extends coronavirus lockdown by at least three weeks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDominic Raab: “Relaxing any of the measures in place would damage both public health and the economy.” Photograph:  Andrew Parsons 10 Downing Street AFPBritain’s coronavirus lockdown will remain in place for at least three weeks and will not be lifted until there is a sustainable fall in the daily death rate and the rate of infection is demonstrably down to a manageable level.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, said social distancing measures were working but that the government’s scientific advisers concluded that lifting them now would be a risk both to public health and the economy.“There is light at the end of the tunnel but we are now at both a delicate and a dangerous stage in this pandemic. If we rush to relax the measures that we have in place we would risk wasting all the sacrifices and all the progress that has been made,” he said.“That would risk a quick return to another lockdown with all the threat to life that a second peak to the virus would bring and all the economic damage that a second lockdown would carry.”Mr Raab was speaking after Britain’s deaths in hospitals from coronavirus rose to 13,729, an increase of 861 since Wednesday. He declined to say how long the restrictions are likely to remain in place beyond the next three weeks but identified five tests before they could be lifted.The conditions are: the National Health Service (NHS) must be able to cope with the number of infections there should be a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, which is currently the highest in Europe reliable data should show the rate of infection was down to manageable levels testing and personal protective equipment must be adequate for future demand and there must be confidence that lifting measures will not risk another peak in infections and deaths.Below 1 per centMr Raab said the government’s scientific advisory panel Sage believed the rate of infection, or the R value, is now below 1 per cent in the community in Britain.“As in other countries we have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and in care homes and in sum, the very clear advice we have received is that any change to our social distancing measures now would risk a significant increase in the spread of the virus,” Mr Raab said.“That would threaten a second peak of the virus and substantially increase the number of deaths. It would undo the progress we have made to date and as a result would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures. So early relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period.”Chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance suggested that the restrictions were likely to be lifted in stages, with some measures removed earlier than others. But he played down speculation that the elderly would have to remain under restrictions for longer than others.“The aim there is to try and do that in a way that allows everything to start moving more towards normal – not to segregate certain groups and say there is a differential approach towards this,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Review launched into \u0026#39disturbing\u0026#39 numbers of BAME people who die of coronavirusExclusive: NHS volunteer army of 750,000 has been given fewer than 20,000 tasks, data revealsCoronavirus latest news: UK lockdown extended for \u0026#39at least\u0026#39 three weeks, Dominic Raab announces\u0026#39Release us!\u0026#39 Anti-lockdown protests break out across America, with some featuring flags and guns Corner stores are being targeted by shoplifters to fund drug habit, warns police chiefNo end in sight for coronavirus lockdownHome office crackdown as number of EU applicants rejected for right to settle doubles in just a monthComment: The truth about the Government’s exit strategy is that there isn’t oneThe Government\u0026#39s five red lines for easing UK coronavirus lockdown measuresCommunity spirit makes comeback amid anxieties of lockdown Britain, survey showsDrug dealers demand \u0026#39risk\u0026#39 money from customers as deserted streets leave them exposed to policeDelhi nurses blame authorities for causing coronavirus spreadGPs urge parents to keep taking sick children to the doctorUK coronavirus cases may have dropped 70 per cent in two weeks, analysis findsCare homes running out of PPE as leaked letter calls Government handling of situation \u0026#39shambolic\u0026#39UK faces eight to ten waves of coronavirus before population achieves herd immunityKim Jong-un\u0026#39s absence from \u0026#39Day of the Sun\u0026#39 celebrations sparks coronavirus speculationPrincess Beatrice\u0026#39s wedding cancelled in coronavirus lockdownOfficial: what you can and can\u0026#39t do in the lockdown, according to new police guidanceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"community spirit makes comeback amid anxieties lockdown britain","story":"People in lockdown Britain are bored and anxious about their relationships and lack of holidays – but community spirit is making a comeback, research has shown.  The Office of National Statistics (ONS) has begun measuring the happiness of the nation and the way in which people are adapting to the biggest change to lifestyles in living memory.The survey, which will continue throughout the coronavirus pandemic, shows that social distancing has not stopped people from communicating, with the main coping strategy to chat with family or friends, followed by watching a film or picking up a book.But as half Britain suffers with boredom, one thing filling people\u0027s time is worrying about the future and the impact that being cooped up with their nearest and dearest is having.However, as those relationships feel strain,  the ONS has discovered that we are reaching out to our local communities.More than half the population said they felt a sense of belonging to their community, and more than two thirds said they thought people are doing more to help others since the coronavirus outbreak. A similar proportion thought they could rely on community support.In the second week of the lockdown – the period covered by the survey – more than half of people had checked on their neighbours at least once, while almost a third had done a task for someone who lived nearby, such as shopping or walking a dog.It is the first time Government statisticians have asked these questions, meaning there is no direct comparison – but earlier surveys had shown that community cohesion was on the decline and only 38 percent of people would exchange favours with their neighbours.The findings were predicted by Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, who said he expected society to respond to the virus with extraordinary outbreaks of altruism, and are reflected in the hundreds of thousands of people who have volunteered to give their time to help the NHS and others.Bringing neighbours together is just one way in which the pandemic is impacting people\u0027s lives, the biggest being on the well-being of 65.9 percent of respondents.More than half of people were concerned that their travel plans had been impacted, and a similar number lamented the fact that they were unable to make any plans under lockdown, with some officials warning that some kind of social distancing measures will have to remain in place until a vaccine is ready – which could mean next year.Other issues affecting people\u0027s lives include the availability of groceries, which concerned 59 per cent of people, and the impact on relationships and other life events such as weddings and funerals, both of which are causing concern for around a third.But people are finding ways to adjust to a new world in which they are only allowed to leave the house for exercise, food shopping and work and are unable to see family and friends they do not live with.The ONS said: Despite restrictions on physical contact with others, finding a way to stay in touch with friends and family remotely is the most popular action that is helping people cope whilst staying at home.Spending time with members of their household was also an important part of coping during this lockdown period. Leisure activities such as watching films (55.5 per cent), reading (39.2 per cent), gardening (37.6 per cent) and cooking (34.2 per cent) were also popular.An overwhelming majority, 85 per cent, said they were worried about the impact coronavirus is having on their life.A quarter of people felt they were spending too much time with people in their home, and a similar number said their relationships were feeling the strain.The largest proportion, at 53.2 percent, were concerned about their relationship with their partner, while 47 percent were concerned about the impact that social distancing will have on their friendships. Just over one in five adults (20.1 per cent) said they felt lonely often or always during the lockdown, a huge rise from 6.1 per cent before the pandemic hit.Almost half – 45.9 per cent – were simply bored because they are forced to spend most of their time at home.Dr James Rubin, an adviser to the the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage), has told MPs that separate polling has shown that 13 percent of people are drinking more.Inevitably we are going to see an impact on people\u0027s health and wellbeing, and we are already seeing some signs of it, he said. These sorts of things will build up. Amid fears over the long-term impact the pandemic will have on people\u0027s mental health, 46 per cent of those questioned said that it was causing them high levels of anxiety.Esther Rantzen, who founded The Silver Line, said that although society seemed to be coming together and showing appreciation for carers and those providing services, there are also worries for the elderly having to self-isolate and those in difficult home situations.This is going to have a huge impact on people and on levels of depression and anxiety, she told The . I think we all have an obligation to make that phone call – the telephone can make a huge difference in lifting spirits and giving people time to talk about the way they feel and also to share memories, experiences and jokes.As so many people have to stay inside,  ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows finances are a major concern. One in five adults are already feeling the pinch and many having to dig into their savings to pay their bills.  Almost half of people aged between 16 and 69 said the lockdown had already had an impact on their work. The biggest change for most will be working from home, which 45.8 per cent of people said that they were doing in the week to April 6, a slight increase from the week before.Almost half thought their financial situation would get worse over the next six months, while more than 80 per cent see a bleak outlook for the economy as a whole.A third of people think it will be between four and six months before their lives get back to normal, but a similar number are convinced it will take longer than six months.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so

measures","story":"Amid criticism that the government has not come up with a credible exit strategy for the shutdown, the Foreign Secretary detailed the criteria that would need to be met before reconsidering the unprecedented measures that were put in place by Boris Johnson on March 23.Setting out “five specific things” upon which the Government needs to be satisfied before making any adjustments to the lockdown, he said NHS capacity would be paramount.“First, we must protect the NHS\u0027s ability to cope,” he said. “We must be confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.”Praising NHS staff as “incredible”, he added: “We must continue to support them as much as we can.”Seven new ‘Nightingale’ Hospitals have been announced which would increase NHS capacity by more than 10,000 beds but currently only three are operational - at London’s Excel centre and in Birmingham and Manchester. \u0027Pop up\u0027 hospitals in Harrogate, Bristol, Warrington and Exeter are yet to open but the latest data suggests that regions outside the M25 are behind the curve of infections. Although the Government originally set a target of 30,000 ventilators needed to deal with treating patients with the coronavirus, that has subsequently been lowered to 18,000.Confirming that 13,729 had now died from Covid-19, a rise of 861 since Wednesday, Mr Raab said the Government had to be “confident that we have moved beyond the peak”.Although the Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty has said coronavirus is “probably reaching the peak overall and that there has been a flattening of the number of fatalities, concerns have been raised that the statistics only refer to hospital deaths and not those in care homes and the community, thereby skewing the figures.The third test for the Government would be having data from the Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) that showed the rate of infection was “decreasing to manageable levels across the board”.Sir Patrick confirmed that SAGE currently assesses that the rate of infection, or the R value, is almost certainly below 1 in the community.That means that on average each infected person is, in turn, infecting less than one other person - suggesting that it’s likely that the virus and the epidemic is now shrinking.”But Mr Raab admitted that: “We still don’t have the infection rate down as far as we need to”.There are concerns that some areas will reach the peak of infections later than others, making a blanket lifting of the restrictions across the UK problematic. Mr Raab admitted that when it came to allowing some economic and social activity to resume, measures could be “relaxed in some areas” while strengthened in others.Mr Raab said the fourth point that needed to be satisfied was that the rate of “operational challenges” including testing capacity and personal protective equipment (PPE) were in hand, “with supply able to meet further demand.”Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged that 100,000 tests would be carried out a day by the end of the month following criticism that the UK had been slow to roll out testing compared to countries like Germany and South Korea which have had far fewer fatalities.On Wednesday, Mr Hancock announced that “everyone in the social care system who needs a test can get one “immediately”.Prior to the announcement, only the first five symptomatic residents in a care home setting are tested to provide confirmation of whether there is an outbreak.Labour’s shadow minister for social care Liz Kendall has said that “only 500 care staff having been tested to date”, and social care needs “a much greater priority and focus than it has had so far”.Downing Street says testing capacity now stands at 19,000 people a day.Mr Raab said the fifth and “really crucial” test to be met was ensuring any adjustments to the current measures would “not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS.”He added: “The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of the virus to hit the NHS and hit the British people.It would be the worst outcome, not just for public health, but for the economy and for our country as a whole.”It came after cabinet ministers met earlier on Thursday and expressed concerns that a second wave in the autumn would cause even greater damage to the UK economy.“It would be economically much worse in the long run if we try to step out too early and suffer a second wave,” said one cabinet minister, admitting: “We are still very much still being led by the science.”Ultimately, Sir Patrick admitted that a vaccine would be the only long-term route out of the crisis.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to

hole proves albert einsteins","story":"A star orbiting a supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way has proven Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity right, astronomers have found.Einstein’s general theory of relativity, published in 1915, which explains gravity as a consequence of the curvature of space-time created by the presence of mass and energy, has never before been proved in the existence of a star orbiting a supermassive black hole. But scientists can now confirm that the orbit of the star, called S2, is shaped like a rosette, which is supported by the physicist general theory of relativity.The star orbits once every 16 years around the supermassive black hole named Sagittarius A*, which is 26,000 light years from the Sun.Einstein\u0027s theory was first evidenced in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun during an eclipse in 1919 and can also explain the orbit of Mercury, said astronomer Guy Perrin, one of the French lead scientists on the project.But, it has taken more than a century to confirm it in a star orbiting a supermassive black hole. The findings, published in the journal Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics, are a result of 27 years of observations of the star using a range of instruments, including the European Space Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope, located in the Atacama Desert in Chile.  Mr Perrin said: “It’s hard to test this theory because you have to reproduce the same kind of experiment in the case of supermassive black holes, which are quite distant from us and they’re very tiny. So you need a huge experiment, large telescopes and access to infrared light. Another thing that was missing 100 years ago, was the ability to combine these large telescopes into an interferometer with incredible precision and accuracy.“The measurements we made are like being able to see pennies on the moon,” he said.Supermassive black holes like Sagittarius A* are the largest type of black hole.At its closest, S2 is less than 20 billion kilometres away from Sagittarius A*, around 120 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun.This makes S2 one of the closest stars ever found in orbit around the enormous giant.As it orbits Sagittarius A*, the star follows an ellipse but the point of closest approach to the black hole does not always occur at the same place.Instead, it slowly moves around the supermassive object, creating a rosette shape. This rotation of the orbit is called a Schwarzschild precession.General relativity provides a precise prediction of how much this orbit changes and, according to the scientists, the measurements from their current research exactly match the theory.Mr Perrin said the study had been trying to address two different questions: the confirmation of Einstein’s theory and the existence of supermassive black holes, which he said scientists are “quite close” to achieving.Reinhard Genzel, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Germany and the architect of the programme, said: One hundred years later we have now detected the same effect in the motion of a star orbiting the compact radio source Sagittarius A* at the centre of the Milky Way.This observational breakthrough strengthens the evidence that Sagittarius A* must be a supermassive black hole of four million times the mass of the Sun.Mr Perrin and Karine Perraut, also one of the French lead scientists on the project, said: Because the S2 measurements follow general relativity so well, we can set stringent limits on how much invisible material, such as distributed dark matter or possible smaller black holes, is present around Sagittarius A*.This is of great interest for understanding the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to

messaging 16s prevent grooming","story":"The social media app TikTok is banning private messaging for under 16-year-olds in bid to stop paedophiles grooming children.The site, which allows teenagers to share short video clips set to music, said the feature would become age-restricted at the end of the month.The move was welcomed by the NSPCC, but the children’s charity also warned that social media companies needed to implement effective age-checks on users to protect children. It comes as police and children’s charities are warning parents that children are at an increased risk of grooming during the lockdown, as they spend more time on their phones.Paedophiles often use open social networks to make contact with children before trying to move conversations onto encrypted messaging sites, where they are harder to monitor.In December, NSPCC research showed that nearly half of online child abuse reports were now coming from Facebook and its sister apps Instagram and WhatsApp.TikTok is the latest social media app that has been rocketing in popularity in recent years and now has nearly one billion users worldwide.The app is particularly popular with younger teenagers who use it to share clips of themselves lip-syncing to pop songs.TikTok\u0027s head of trust and safety for Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Cormac Keenan said the move was aimed at ensuring families could trust the service.He confirmed that the new restrictions would mean only those aged 16 and over would be able to send or receive direct messages on TikTok.Direct Messaging is an amazing tool that enables people to make new friends and connections no matter where they are in the world, but despite its potential for good, we understand the potential for misuse, he said.TikTok has previously introduced a Family Pairing Mode which enabled parents and s to manage the experience of their children on the platform.The video platform said that anyone who will be impacted by the change will receive a notification in the app starting from today.Following the announcement, Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC praised the proactive step taken by the social media firm.This is a bold move by TikTok as we know that groomers use direct messaging to cast the net widely and contact large numbers of children, he said.Offenders are taking advantage of the current climate to target children spending more time online, but this shows proactive steps can be taken to make sites safer and frustrate groomers from being able to exploit unsafe design choices.It\u0027s time tech firms did more to identify which of their users are children and make sure they are given the safest accounts by default.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to

dropped 70 per cent two weeks","story":"Coronavirus cases could have fallen by 70 per cent in a fortnight, major UK research suggests. A study by King\u0027s College London, which tracked more than two million people using an app, suggests that cases have dropped dramatically since the country went into lockdown.The modelling predicts that the number of people suffering symptoms of the virus across Britain has dropped from two million to less than 583,000 over 14 days. The tracker also suggests there is little difference between urban areas and the countryside when it comes to the prevalence of symptoms. National data shows that, in recent days, the number of people admitted to hospital suffering from coronavirus has begun to plateau and may even be falling. The number of deaths has shown a similar pattern, but there are fears that some statistics may be misleading because of a time lag before some cases which occurred over the long Easter weekend are recorded.It comes as the latest UK figures show that there have been 13,729 deaths – a rise of 861 in a day – with 103,093 cases of coronavirus.The new research measures symptoms among a large sample of the population. This means it is likely to detect earlier changes in disease patterns, with hospitalisation among the most severe cases normally falling around two weeks after signs such as coughs and fevers first emerge. Previous research from the same study recently suggested that losing the senses of taste and smell may be the most reliable symptom of coronavirus. Scientists found that almost 60 per cent of people with the virus had lost those senses, compared with just 32 per cent who reported suffering a fever.Currently, people in the UK are instructed to self-isolate only if they have a persistent cough, a high temperature or both.Lead researcher Professor Tim Spector from King’s College London, said: It\u0027s very reassuring to see that the number of predicted symptomatic Covid cases is continuing to fall day on day across the UK but, with deaths still high, this is definitely not the time for complacency. We believe our population\u0027s symptoms are changing around two weeks before most people are admitted to hospital. Prof Spector said the data suggested there is still a large number of infectious people in the UK with mild symptoms, meaning it would be premature to lift the lockdown.It came as NHS England statistics showed that April 8 had seen the highest coronavirus death toll in England\u0027s hospitals to date, suggesting the rate of deaths could soon fall. However, officials have warned that data from recent days, including the Easter weekend, may not be up to date.Since the beginning of April, NHS England has been constantly revising its daily death count from across hospital trusts.Its data feeds into the Department for Health and Social Care releases which make headlines each day. But the daily DHSC tally often includes deaths which have occurred several days earlier. For example, the tally of hospital deaths announced on April 16 included deaths from as far back as April 1.Of the 740 deaths in English hospitals announced on Thursday, 79 per cent (587) occurred between Monday and Wednesday.The latest figures show 782 deaths in England on April 8, dropping to 674 on April 9 and 651 on April 16. However, the latter figure is likely to rise the most, given the time lag before some deaths are reported. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk could testing 20000 people every day government official","story":"The UK could be testing almost 20,000 more people a day if it was using the testing capacity it already has, government officials have admitted. On Thursday Downing Street said almost 16,000 tests had been carried out in the previous 24 hours, including around 6,000 on NHS staff and their relatives.A spokesman for Number 10 said total testing capacity is now capable of doing 35,000 coronavirus tests a day, including more than 20,771 NHS tests, and around 14,300 commercial tests.He said spare capacity should be used to test staff and others who are eligible.Asked why they hadn’t extended the eligibility criteria to take advantage of the spare capacity, the PM’s spokesman said: “We have extended the the eligibility but we will keep it under review.”On Monday the Health Secretary suggested the lack of take up of tests was down to the fact  “demand has been lower over the Easter weekend”.A month ago he said that 25,000 tests a day would be being carried out by mid-April.But speaking on Thursday he could only insist that a more recent target - to carry out 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month - will still be met. The day before Matt Hancock had said testing is available right across the NHS and social care for all those who need it, telling the Downing Street press conference that there is spare capacity in the thousands.It comes after ministers promised to offer widespread testing to staff and resident of care homes. Some 4,100 social care staff have already been referred for tests, he said. However, earlier in the day the sector said just over 500 tests had been carried out. Professor Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, said: “Ramping up testing in care homes is crucial to enable them to respond more effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic.” “Care England welcomes the Government’s commitments around testing in recent days, but questions remain over how this policy can be implemented in a timely and effective fashion.”He said the Goverment had failed to explain which staff would be eligible for testing. It has been claimed that NHS biomedical scientists have been held back from ramping up Covid-19 testing by a lack of kit, not a lack of capacity.The Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) said NHS labs were still struggling to source kits and reagents, and cast doubt on the ability to reach Health Secretary Matt Hancock\u0027s end-of-the-month target of 100,000 tests a day.The body also warned that new mega-labs set up by the Government may end up competing with established NHS labs.IBMS president Allan Wilson said he wished to stress his concern about the shortage of Covid-19 testing supplies needed to meet the Government\u0027s 100,000 tests a day target.The 17,000 NHS laboratory workers that I represent are increasingly expressing their frustration.They have applied themselves innovatively to increase Covid-19 testing capacity and have the platforms ready so that the NHS laboratories are able to meet the Secretary of State\u0027s ambitious target, but they are still not able to source the testing kits and reagents they require.It concerns me when I see significant investments being made in mass testing centres that are planning to conduct 75,000 of the 100,000 tests a day.These facilities would be a welcome resource and take pressure off the NHS if the issue around testing was one of capacity.However, we are clear that it is a global supply shortage holding biomedical scientists back, not a lack of capacity.Mr Wilson said there was concern that mass testing centres may only serve to increase competition for what are already scarce supplies.He said NHS testing numbers could fall if laboratories are competing with big testing centres for Covid-19 testing kits and reagents in a Wild West testing scenario.He added: The UK must avoid this for the sake of patient safety.It is clear that two testing streams now exist: one delivered by highly qualified and experienced Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) registered biomedical scientists working in heavily regulated United Kingdom Accreditation Services (UKAS) accredited laboratories, the other delivered mainly by volunteer unregistered staff in unaccredited laboratories that have been established within a few weeks.He said the IBMS had not been involved in assuring the quality of the testing centres and are now being kept at arm\u0027s length from their processes, even when they exist close to large NHS laboratories.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk faces eight ten waves coronavirus population achieves herd","story":"Hopes that Britain can achieve widespread Covid-19 immunity by the end of the lockdown have been dealt a devastating blow after research suggested only a small proportion may have acquired resistance to the disease.Drawing on the research, Professor Anthony Costello, a former British director of the World Health Organisation, warned that the UK faces eight to ten waves of coronavirus before the population achieves herd immunity.In such a scenario, both the death toll and economic consequences would be catastrophic.In the middle of March, before the lockdown was introduced, Sir Patrick Vallance, the country\u0027s chief scientific adviser, said about 40m people in the UK could need to catch the coronavirus to build up “herd immunity” and prevent the disease coming back in the future. Sir Patrick was defending Boris Johnson’s decision at the time not to follow other European countries by closing schools and banning mass gatherings. But on Friday Prof Costello, chair of global health at University College London, will heavily criticise the Government’s strategy in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic in evidence he will give to the health and social care select committee.Professor Costello said the failure to conduct widespread testing and to rely solely on the lockdown will leave Britain facing wave after wave of coronavirus until a vaccine is found.Prof Costello also said a Dutch study - if it proved accurate - raised serious concern for the UK because it suggested just three per cent of the Netherlands had acquired immunity by the end of the first week of April - when the pandemic was at its peak in that country.The study, conducted by Dutch blood bank authorities, analysed tests for the Covid-19 antibody - an indicator of immunity - on 4,200 blood donors.Just three per cent had acquired immunity, the scientists concluded. Prof Costello said if the findings were verified that would have alarming consequences for the UK’s ability to fight coronavirus.He said: “We won’t get herd immunity if what the latest models show are correct. In the UK we would have to get through another eight to ten waves to get to herd immunity. This study in the Netherlands shows antibody levels are very low in the community and so the idea it is rapidly spreading and giving protection at the same time isn’t there.”He pointed to another study by Professor Karl Friston, a neuroscientist also at UCL, who in a paper submitted to one of the Government’s scientific panels suggesting that on average just 6.4 per cent of Europe will have acquired immunity by the end of the first lockdown.Prof Friston predicts 49,000 Britons will die from coronavirus - more than twice most mainstream estimates - but with immunity for 19 per cent of the surviving population.The Government has been condemned for its failure to implement widespread testing and tracing.Its target of 100,000 daily tests by the end of the month is struggling to be met while critics have accused ministers of being too slow to implement the testing regime.Prof Costello described the Government as a “one club golfer”, for using only one strategy - lockdown - to combat Covid-19.“We should have introduced the lockdown two or three weeks earlier but we didn’t,” he said, “It should be combined with testing, tracing and digital apps that have been used so successfully in South Korea.”South Korea, which was hit by the virus much earlier than the UK, has recorded just 229 deaths, compared to the UK death toll of 13,729.Prof Costello added: “It is a total mess and we have been wrong every stage of the way. We have to change our policy and at the moment I don’t hear anything to suggest we are. They keep talking about flattening the curve which implies they are seeking herd immunity but what we should have done is crushed the epidemic and then  keep it down.”He said the academics on the Government’s main advisory panel - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)  - “have got most of it wrong”.He joined growing criticism that Sage’s meetings are held in private and that its membership is not made public.The Government had floated the idea of herd immunity before introducing lockdown after being warned as many as 500,000 people could die if coronavirus was allowed to rampage through the UK unchecked.A separate Oxford University at the end of March suggested as much as half the population could have already acquired immunity, based on an assumption that the virus had begun transmission in the UK more than a month before the first recorded death and that very few people need hospitalisation.The research was downplayed as an outlier by rival universities, also modelling for the virus’s progression. The Dutch study tested blood and plasma samples of blood donors in the week beginning April 1.Preliminary results show that the presence of antibodies varied across age groups with 3.6 percent of young blood donors between 18 and 20 years old having Covid-19 antibodies.The proportion decreased with age with no antibodies found among donors in their 70s although that represented only ten iniduals.The Dutch scientists concluded that iniduals who have recovered from the coronavirus have some degree of immunity. Another Dutch study has suggested that people with milder symptoms appear to build up less immunity than people who became very ill from Covid-19. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks lockdown extension rubber stamped biggest day dominic raabs","story":"The announcement of another three weeks of lockdown was the culmination of a frantic day of video conferencing, with Dominic Raab chairing three high-level meetings in one day as well as attending a ‘virtual’ G7 summit. Ministers later admitted that everyone knew that the decision had already been made,” by the time the full Cabinet met at 11.That meeting lasted more than an hour - longer than expected, with the Foreign Secretary joined on the call by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific advisor.He reportedly relayed both good news and bad news: while the science showed the social distancing measures were working and critical care capacity had been adequately bolstered, Britain still wasn’t at “tipping point”.“The consensus was we are going in the right direction but it would be economically much worse in the long run if we try to step out too early and suffer a second wave,” they added. “We are getting to that moment but it’s not a dot on a graph. We were all of the view that we are not there yet.” Another cabinet insider said: “They’re very much still being led by the science.”Information was fed in from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), the governments’ chief scientific advisers, which also met yesterday (Thurs), prompting a discussion about some of the behavioural science around lifting the lockdown.One of the most prominent members of SAGE, Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, had ruffled feathers in Government earlier in the day by suggesting that indefinite social distancing will be needed until a vaccine is found, which could take a year or more.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, appeared irritated by Mr Ferguson\u0027s suggestion when he was asked about it by the BBC, pointing out that Mr Ferguson was not a member of the Government.“Everyone was very much on the same page,” said one Cabinet source. “The priority is protecting people\u0027s health and wellbeing.Although the Prime Minister, who continues to convalesce at Chequers, was not directly involved in any of the meetings, ministers were understood to be mindful of his desire to “take the people with us.”Amid fears some have ‘over-interpreted’ the guidance, it was agreed that schools could not reopen if MPs hadn’t returned to parliament.An argument is gaining ground that reception year pupils should go back first, because of the huge developmental importance of the first year of formal schooling, followed by other primary years, which are harder to teach via videolink than older children are in secondary schools.Children in Year 10, preparing for GCSEs next year, and in the lower sixth form, sitting A-levels next summer, could also go back sooner than other years because they are such a vital stage of their education.While there is currently no exit plan in place, discussions are already understood to have taken place about a sector by sector lifting of the lockdown, with ministers raising the question of why you can\u0027t open more shops if supermarkets can enforce social distancing, and a desire to increase construction.Much of the rest of conversation focused on whether Secretaries of State will return to Westminster physically or virtually following the Easter recess next week. MPs are set to be able to quiz ministers via Zoom for the first time in the House of Commons 700-year history, following agreement by the House authorities.Approval has been given to allow up to 120 MPs at any one time to take part in proceedings virtually, while around 50 could remain in the chamber under strict social distancing rules.But it is not yet known whether cabinet ministers will appear in person or from home. One cabinet minister said: “The House will be sitting but in what physical capacity we’re still not sure. I’m expecting to take questions next week, but I’m still not sure how I will be doing it.”Another insider revealed: “The feeling was you can’t have too many MPs coming back to Parliament while the country’s still locked down.”Ministers called for as much cross party cooperation as possible to ensure that there were no “contentious” issues arising over the course of the next three weeks.A Downing Street spokesman said: The clear message from Cabinet was to thank the public for the enormous sacrifices which have been made so far to slow the spread of the virus. They have protected the NHS and saved lives.“The Cabinet agreed to be guided by the scientific advice and to take the right decisions at the right time.The video conference, which was chaired by the US President since America currently holds the G7 Presidency, assessed the joint progress made in combating the Covid-19 pandemic and its immediate consequence.Mr Raab is understood to have pushed for international collaboration on both the economic and global health response to the outbreak. As well as calling for the production of vaccines, treatments and tests to be sped up internationally, he urged joint G7 action to support more vulnerable countries.The meeting came after President Trump announced he was postponing funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO) while a review was conducted to assess its “role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus”. He also criticised the organisation’s relationship with China.Having spent most of the day in the Cabinet room at Number 10, from where he had chaired the morning Covid-19 committee meeting and Cabinet, Mr Raab then dialled in to Zoom again to chair a 3.30pm meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, where the inevitable decision to extend until at least the early Spring bank holiday was rubber-stamped. Four Zoom conferences and a press conference later, there was still no end in sight.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watchhow covid 19 pandemic began","story":"Conspiracies have run wild about the origin of Coronavirus, but experts believe it is most likely that the virus originated from bats.

We couldn’t ring them. When we did, they said they would call back within four hours but instead we got an email back in 24 hours.

How is any marquee hire business viable in these circumstances?“The bank are looking back over the last three to six months. Naturally that’s our weakest time of year over the winter so of course we’re not going to be showing our best performance. They should be looking at a 12-month .”Banks told to ‘repay the favour’ and hand out business loansMany other small businesses have experienced similar difficulties. Banks have granted just 6,020 loans totalling £1.1bn under the CBILS scheme so far, figures from the industry’s lobbying group UK Finance show. That’s despite the fact that the government is backing 80 per cent of the value of the loans, reducing risk for banks.Numbers of approvals have begun to rise, doubling over the past week – albeit from a low base. Lenders approved £300m of borrowing over the Easter bank holiday weekend, but business groups warn that the pace at which banks are acting is nowhere near quick enough to stop a large number of firms going out of business in a matter of weeks.“There’s still a lot of work to do,” said Mike Cherry, chair\u0026nbspof the Federation of Small Businesses.“Many members tell us it’s difficult to get to the formal application stage — banks are still slow to respond to CBILS enquiries.“Even if you do get your forms through, the process is very demanding for the uninitiated. We need simplification: banks should look at pre-filling forms based on data they already have on customers, and we shouldn’t have behind-the-scenes reporting requirements holding up approvals.”Banks say that one in five applications are successful, but there are no figures for how many companies have enquired about the loans. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the vast majority have not filed a formal application as they\u0026nbspbelieve\u0026nbsptheir bank will not approve it.“We’re lacking detail about the customer journey from start to finish,” said Mr Cherry. “How many have enquired? How many have dropped out at the application stage? What happens to those who are rejected? Are banks receptive to those who are not existing customers?”Some business owners who have applied say they have been required to fill out dozens of pages of forms asking detailed questions.Mr Sunak said when launching the scheme that it had been designed to quickly get money to businesses that need it. But\u0026nbspMr Morris said\u0026nbsphis experience has not matched\u0026nbspthe government’s depiction. He says NatWest has been “very, very cagey” about the scheme.“They delete our emails and respond to their own questions.”\u0026nbspThe last one he received from his relationship manager at the bank stated: “I’m not in a position to comment further. This is our final response to you regarding CBILS.“Trying to get all this together is a bit of a nightmare. There should be some assistance available from the bank. I’m not sure the banks have really grasped the scale of what they’re dealing with, they don’t understand the size of the problem.”Without access to funding or an indication from the government about when lockdown restrictions might be eased, Mr Morris\u0026nbspis not sure how long the company can carry on trading.“It’s a very difficult position, we have to be a realistic.“We’ve already furloughed some staff and we’re going to have to take further cost-cutting measures. But the business can’t survive on thin air.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

been attacked across the UK after conspiracy theories spread on social media claiming the virus was linked to the roll-out of 5G, despite scientists describing such a theory as “both a physical and biological impossibility” and the industry branding it “utter rubbish”.Facebook said\u0026nbspit has now directed more than two billion people to resources from official health authorities through its own information centre, and displayed warnings on around 40 million posts on the platform which had been rated at least partly false by fact-checkers.However, last week, research from industry regulator Ofcom suggested that nearly half of UK adults online had been exposed to false claims around the virus.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has also met internet giants – including Facebook – to urge a further clampdown on misinformation appearing online.“To date, we’ve also removed hundreds of thousands of pieces of misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm,” Mr Rosen

We couldn’t ring them. When we did, they said they would call back within four hours but instead we got an email back in 24 hours.

How is any marquee hire business viable in these circumstances?“The bank are looking back over the last three to six months. Naturally that’s our weakest time of year over the winter so of course we’re not going to be showing our best performance. They should be looking at a 12-month .”Banks told to ‘repay the favour’ and hand out business loansMany other small businesses have experienced similar difficulties. Banks have granted just 6,020 loans totalling £1.1bn under the CBILS scheme so far, figures from the industry’s lobbying group UK Finance show. That’s despite the fact that the government is backing 80 per cent of the value of the loans, reducing risk for banks.Numbers of approvals have begun to rise, doubling over the past week – albeit from a low base. Lenders approved £300m of borrowing over the Easter bank holiday weekend, but business groups warn that the pace at which banks are acting is nowhere near quick enough to stop a large number of firms going out of business in a matter of weeks.“There’s still a lot of work to do,” said Mike Cherry, chair\u0026nbspof the Federation of Small Businesses.“Many members tell us it’s difficult to get to the formal application stage — banks are still slow to respond to CBILS enquiries.“Even if you do get your forms through, the process is very demanding for the uninitiated. We need simplification: banks should look at pre-filling forms based on data they already have on customers, and we shouldn’t have behind-the-scenes reporting requirements holding up approvals.”Banks say that one in five applications are successful, but there are no figures for how many companies have enquired about the loans. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the vast majority have not filed a formal application as they\u0026nbspbelieve\u0026nbsptheir bank will not approve it.“We’re lacking detail about the customer journey from start to finish,” said Mr Cherry. “How many have enquired? How many have dropped out at the application stage? What happens to those who are rejected? Are banks receptive to those who are not existing customers?”Some business owners who have applied say they have been required to fill out dozens of pages of forms asking detailed questions.Mr Sunak said when launching the scheme that it had been designed to quickly get money to businesses that need it. But\u0026nbspMr Morris said\u0026nbsphis experience has not matched\u0026nbspthe government’s depiction. He says NatWest has been “very, very cagey” about the scheme.“They delete our emails and respond to their own questions.”\u0026nbspThe last one he received from his relationship manager at the bank stated: “I’m not in a position to comment further. This is our final response to you regarding CBILS.“Trying to get all this together is a bit of a nightmare. There should be some assistance available from the bank. I’m not sure the banks have really grasped the scale of what they’re dealing with, they don’t understand the size of the problem.”Without access to funding or an indication from the government about when lockdown restrictions might be eased, Mr Morris\u0026nbspis not sure how long the company can carry on trading.“It’s a very difficult position, we have to be a realistic.“We’ve already furloughed some staff and we’re going to have to take further cost-cutting measures. But the business can’t survive on thin air.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But as part of new research, scientists were able to have another look at the information in the Kepler data and see that it really was a previously undiscovered planet.In fact, it is the most similar to Earth of any planet discovered by the Kepler space telescope, in terms of its size and estimated temperature. While other exoplanets may be more similar in size or temperature, no world has been discovered that has quite such a combination of those two qualities, as well as lying in the habitable zone.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien lifeThe planet is 300 light-years from us, just a little larger than our Earth and receives about 75 per cent of the light that we get from our own Sun. That means the temperature could be similar, too, allowing for the conditions required for life.Scientists are concerned, however, that its star is a red dwarf, unlike our own more stable Sun. Such stars are known for throwing out stellar flare-ups that could destroy any potential life before it takes hold on the planet.Scientists now hope to learn more about the planet, including any information about its atmosphere and to get more specific knowledge of its size and conditions.This intriguing, distant world gives us even greater hope that a second Earth lies among the stars, waiting to be found,” said Thomas\u0026nbspZurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But experts tell Jon Stone it still isn\u0027t clear to what extent pupils could spread coronavirusThe government is showing no sign of easing its coronavirus lockdown restrictions, with another extension to the measures confirmed on Thursday. But the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is reported to have privately made clear that if it were up to him, schools would be reopening.The issue is contentious: the science of to what extent children contribute to the pandemic, and by how much, is uncertain. Childcare is becoming an issue for many parents who are not key workers and thus entitled to still send their children to class. And with what started as an extended Easter holiday is in danger of turning into several months off school, pupils are starting to miss out on serious amounts of education.“I suspect we might open schools again, partly because there is still debate about whether school closures are actually beneficial or not,” Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia tells The Independent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We’ve not answered that, and there are very good reasons why school closures, in terms of the children, might actually not be that useful. And if they don’t get that ill, maybe they’re not that infectious – but it is a maybe.”This uncertainty is key to the question of how long this extended Easter break might turn out to be, and whether it starts to turn into a summer holiday before children go back to class.Police find 17 bodies piling up inside nursing home morgueNurses suspended after refusing to treat patients without N95 masksUK coronavirus hospital death toll rises to 13,729Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert in disease modelling at the University of Warwick, tells The Independent that even if children are less effective vectors for the virus, the fact that so many of them would be crowded into schools could pose a risk.“The problem is there’s still an awful lot of uncertainty, and this is the real concern we have,” he says. “We know from the data coming in that children tend to have much more mild symptoms than the older age groups. Where there is still a lot of uncertainty is how much they transmit and this is a big concern.”Children themselves might not be getting sick, but could still be acting as carriers for the disease.“Even if someone is asymptomatic and has no symptoms at all it’s still possible they can transmit the virus. If someone has very clear symptoms and is coughing a lot they’re much more likely to transmit and spread droplets, so it’s very likely that people with very severe symptoms will have a higher transmission rate,” says Dr Tildesley.“But what we don’t know and what’s still uncertain is the role of these asymptomatic or mild cases in infection. This is the concern because of course even if that’s lower the fact that you’ve got a lot of children in one place is a concern.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWith repeated government promises to ramp up Covid-19 testing falling short, there is very little data around about the extent to which people – never mind children – are even being asymptotically infected. Until that bottleneck is sorted, it will be hard to judge exactly how many people are carrying the virus. But with seriously ill people and NHS workers being prioritised for the limited number of tests, people with no symptoms are a long way down the list.The manner in which\u0026nbspthe lockdown\u0026nbspwas implemented\u0026nbspis also a problem, as it becomes difficult to separate out the different measures and tell which ones are making a difference.It may be that if you allow children back to school and we see cases climbing again it may be that schools have to be closed once again.“It may be that if you allow children back to school and we see cases climbing again it may be that schools have to be closed once again.”At this point, any decision to reopen schools, even if it was based on the available scientific evidence, would be a guess –\u0026nbspbecause there isn’t much scientific evidence yet available. But many teachers are worried about being flung into the classroom as an experiment when the science is not yet clear.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union tells The Independent\u0026nbspit would be reckless to put “political or business” considerations ahead of safety.“Everyone is anxious to return to normality as soon as possible, but decisions to either strengthen or loosen the current restrictions must always be governed by the medical and scientific evidence. Political or business considerations must never be allowed to override the safety of pupils, school staff and the wider community,” he says.“The NASUWT is committed to work with the government to protect public health and the health of our members who, along with other public service workers, are doing so much to help the country through this crisis.”One option being recommended by some epidemiologists is bringing schools back, but with specific social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the virus: setting desks further apart, closing playgrounds, asking children to keep their distance. Teachers could also be given protective equipment (PPE): another union, the National Education Union (NEU) has written to the prime minister asking him to base any decision to reopen partly on the “availability of appropriate PPE and enhanced levels of cleaning”.One study published in The Lancet medical journal, which looks at data from the 2003 Sars outbreak in China, suggests schools could come back earlier if students could be prevented from mixing and have social-distancing measures imposed during class.“Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groupsclassrooms increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes, should be considered if restrictive social-distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time,” said Professor Russell Viner, one of the authors of the study.In Denmark, schools this week started to reopen in a staggered manner, with different arrival times and just the first five year groups plus kindergartens back for now. The youngest children are going back first because they are thought to be the least vulnerable to the virus and also the most difficult to arrange childcare for, keeping workers tied up looking after their families.But if the UK’s 506,400 full-time teachers are to be given protective equipment, the UK’s supply lines, already insufficient for NHS staff and care workers, are a long way off from being able to cope. And teachers say that there are other practical issues to consider.Katharine Birbalsingh, the high-profile headteacher of Michaela Community School in Brent, north London, has said\u0026nbspit was a “lie” that social distancing is possible in schools.“The fact is that social distancing in schools is simply impossible,” she said. “We’re considered to be the strictest school in Britain and even we would find it impossible.”Number of full-time teachers working in the UKMs Birbalsingh said\u0026nbspshe understood that “schools cannot stay closed for 10 months”, and that they might have to open eventually, but said the government should be upfront with teachers and the public about the risks.“Schools will open at some point, but what I don’t want is for people to perpetuate the lie –\u0026nbspand it is a lie – that social distancing is possible. It just isn’t,” she said.Staffing would also be an issue, the headteacher told the BBC, with supply teachers not an adequate replacement on such a grand scale.“The other thing to remember is that from the point of view of a head teacher, if you have to send home staff who have underlying issues, if you have to send home your staff who have a cough you are probably going to have fewer than half your staff in. So if you have half your staff in, how are you filling your classrooms with teachers? You can’t.“And you’ve got to think about the kind of chaos that then ensues in schools when children don’t have their own teachers – you have cover teachers, and we all know what you used to do in schools when you had a supply teacher.”Dr Tildesley also notes the problems, telling The Independent: “Possibly for secondary school children it’s easier to implement a policy like that for primary school, that’s a challenge –\u0026nbspI’ve got two six year olds, trying to explain to them the concept of going back to school but not hugging their friends is a real challenge. I think that’s difficult.”Despite these concerns, other countries in addition to Denmark are going ahead with reopening schools anyway. Germany announced on Wednesday that it would start opening schools early next month, and Austria and France have also set tentative timetables.Given the lack of clear information, this, says Dr Tildesley, could be “useful” for the UK authorities in deciding which way to go.“We are seeing other countries in Europe who have declared that they are going to start sending children back to school earlier than us. That will also give us some evidence,” he says.“It would be really informative to use to look at their epidemic curves and how they might change when children start to go back to school. Of course, every country is different but it would at least give us some evidence of what that effect might be.”But, he adds, evidence would take several weeks to filter through, given the virus’s incubation period – and if schools reopen at the same time as other measures are lifted it would be harder to disentangle the effect. It is for this reason that the European Commission has asked countries to leave gaps of weeks between phasing out different measures stating that “sufficient time should be left between the steps (eg one month), as the effect of their lifting can only be measured over time”. Whether member states, under domestic political pressure of their own, adhere to this will remain to be seen.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)“There is going to be something of a lag in that and two, three weeks really before we start to see strong evidence of what the effectiveness of that policy is,” Dr Tildesley said.If the government makes the leap to opening schools any time soon, it will be somewhat of an experiment.“There’s always a trade off here,” says Dr Tildseley. “I accept this as an infectious disease modeller, we tend to be very focused on trying to minimise the risk to human health of the virus, but of course there is another aspect of this and it’s something I’m aware of: you can’t stay in a lockdown strategy forever.“If all we cared about was minimising deaths then essentially you would persist with lockdown. But there’s a practical side to it. At some point you’ve got to start to visit measures for lifting.“This becomes a really difficult political decision because you have the problem of if you open them and it’s deemed to be too soon and cases begin to climb again, you could start to lose public trust.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This review must be the first step in ensuring that all communities are equally protected from this virus.”Meanwhile, a recent\u0026nbsppoll for The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed that people from Bame backgrounds were being hit harder by lockdown measures, with Bame households\u0026nbspalmost twice as likely as white Britons to report having lost income and jobs.Pollsters BMG found that 46 per cent of Bame people said that their household income had reduced as a result of coronavirus, against 28 per cent of white British families.Around 15 per cent of respondents from ethnic minorities said they had lost their job, compared with 8 per cent of white Britons.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Using data from the Office for National Statistics, the charity estimated this would amount to 1,696,000 million private renters in England.The organisation said that a growing number of people will be forced to rely on welfare payments for the first time due to covid-19, and urged the government to increase housing benefit so that it covers the average costs of local rents.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: London on lockdown Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man walks down a deserted Camden High StreetGoodge Street Station is one of the many stations closed to help reduce the spreadAn empty street in the heart of ChinatownPeople in masks in Chinatown a day after the lockdownA near-empty Piccadilly Circus during the first week of lockdownSonja, my neighbour, who I photographed while taking a short walk.

Renters’ unions and opposition parities have previously called on the government to suspend rents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Shelter’s chief executive Polly Neate praised the decision to temporarily suspend evictions during the pandemic, but added: “Millions of renters will be in dire straits further down the line without more government support.“As renters lose their jobs and see their incomes hit, many will have to rely on the welfare safety net for the first time. Our services are already hearing from families in homes they could comfortably afford under normal circumstances, who are now in serious financial difficulty.“We are facing an onslaught of people suddenly unable to afford their rent, at a time when people need to stay put and cannot safely move to a cheaper home. To avoid spiralling debt and needless evictions once the ban lifts, the government must increase\u0026nbspthe housing element of universal credit so that it covers the average cost of local rents.”A government spokesperson said: “The government has put in place unprecedented measures to support tenants from getting into financial hardship or rent arrears, including protecting millions\u0026nbspof jobs up and down the country and increasing universal credit and housing allowances.“Emergency legislation is now in place so no social or private renter can be forced out of their home – with landlords unable to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least the next three months.

Critics have blamed wet markets\u0026nbspwhere Chinese consumers buy live animals for enabling the crossover of the bacteria from wild populations.And doubts have been raised over the transparency shown by Chinese authorities on death rates and the geographical spread of the disease.Mr Raab, who is standing in for Boris Johnson while the prime minister recuperates from a bout of coronavirus,\u0026nbspsaid the UK has had good cooperation with China in relation to the return of UK nationals from Wuhan and the procurement of equipment.But he said: “I think there absolutely needs to be a very, very deep e after-the-event review of the lessons – including of the outbreak of the virus – and I don’t think we can flinch from that at all, it needs to be driven by the science.”He declined to speculate on the outcome of any review, saying: “We will look very carefully with all our the other international partners, and the World Health Organisation and other international organisations as to how this outbreak happened and what can be done to prevent it happening in the future.“Until we get those answers, we can’t really track a way forward.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But he played down suggestions that the elderly might be kept in lockdown for longer than the young.“The aim is to try and do that in a way that allows everything to start moving more towards normal – not to segregate\u0026nbspcertain groups and say there is a differential approach towards this,” he said.​Sir Patrick stressed vaccines and therapeutics would be key to restoring normal life in the UK. “Those are going to be critically important,” he said.Government scientific adviser Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, had earlier told BBC Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme the country would need to maintain “a significant level of social distancing, probably indefinitely until we have a vaccine available”.Mr Raab urged the nation to stay patient, adding: “We’ve just come too far, we’ve lost too many loved ones, we’ve already sacrificed far too much to ease up now, especially when we’re beginning to see the evidence that our efforts are starting to pay off.“And your efforts are paying off, there is light at the end of the tunnel. But we’re now at both a delicate and a dangerous stage in this pandemic.“If we rush to relax the measures that we have in place, we would risk wasting all the sacrifices and all the progress that has been made.”The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, urged people with conditions such as heart disease and stroke\u0026nbspto continue accessing\u0026nbspNHS help as normal, amid evidence that recent weeks have seen “excess mortality” for reasons other than the coronavirus. Despite the burden of Covid-19, the NHS was “open for business” and has maintained the capacity to deal with emergencies in the usual way, he said.“In the last week for which we have data, 3,475 people were diagnosed as having Covid – some of them in hospital, some of them outside hospital – but the excess mortality in terms of the period as a whole was somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 people,” he said.“That could just be random variation, but people die for many reasons in epidemics. They include the direct cause of death, but they can also include people who stayed at home because they were worried that going into hospital was dangerous for them and they have a heart attack or a stroke.“It is really critical for people to realise that\u0026nbspwe really appreciate people taking pressure off the NHS for less urgent things, but if they are having a medical emergency like a heart attack, a stroke or a really bad flare-up of asthma which could be life-threatening ... then the NHS is open for business. We really must encourage people who have life-threatening or life-changing things to go to hospital, contact NHS 111 where that’s necessary.“It would be very sad to have a situation where people’s activities have managed to preserve the ability to do emergencies but people are not coming forward.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Because it’s what’s called relative risk. If you really feel that you don’t want to have any part of this virus, will you maintain six feet away, wear a mask, do all the things that we talk about in the guidelines?” Dr Fauci said, adding: “You know, everybody has their own tolerance for risks. And it depends on the level of the interaction that you want to have.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“If you’re looking for friends, sit in a room and put a mask on and, you know, chat a bit. If you want to go a bit more intimate, then that’s your choice regarding a risk.”According to Dr Fauci, the decision whether or not to meet up with someone from a dating app becomes even trickier when considering that people who are asymptomatic are also spreading the virus.Explaining that it would be “much easier” if only people who were sick were contagious, Dr Fauci said: “But what we’re seeing, which becomes really problematic, is that there’s a considerable amount of transmission from an asymptomatic person.”Earlier in the interview, the White House coronavirus task force expert also cautioned against festivals such as Coachella in the future, explaining that it would make him “really nervous”.“Well, if there’s virus in the community, it makes me really, really nervous. Really nervous because outbreaks and clusters have been the things that have fuelled outbreaks in different cities throughout the world,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others said it was “natural, without chemicals, and safe to eat”.Alongside the popularity of southeast Asia’s wildlife markets selling a wide variety of animals for consumption, the trade in dog and cat meat has been rising over the past three years, the organisation says.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Before the outbreak, about 10 million dogs and cats were slaughtered for eating in Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia every year, according to Four Paws.But its investigators said they had witnessed and heard how\u0026nbspsales of the meat in the region had risen during the global pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“We had expected the trade to be curtailed after the outbreak and in view of the restrictions,” said Katherine Polak, a vet and head of Four Paws’ stray animal care in southeast Asia. “But were surprised to find the traders saying business was better than ever.”The research teams interviewed sellers in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, and in the northwest\u0026nbspCambodian town of Siem Reap and capital, Phnom Penh.In Siem Reap, she said their teams found a few traders had closed, but those that remained were “rewarded with better business”.With each trader selling at least three dog carcasses a day, about 300 dogs are being killed in the town daily, they estimated.Illegal wildlife traders cash in on coronavirus with rhino horn ‘cure’China promotes bile from caged bears to treat coronavirus Indian traders ‘risking more viruses with squalid animal slaughter’ China bans eating wild animals including pangolin in coronavirus blitzExperts pressure WHO over live animal trade to prevent more pandemicsMeat buyers in both Cambodia and Vietnam told the investigators that the World Health Organisation’s\u0026nbspannouncement on cats and dogs not catching the virus prompted people to think that eating them was safe.“Our team who talked to the traders reported an initial decrease after the outbreak because people thought maybe there was a relationship with the virus, but the Cambodian government dismissed that notion after the World Health Organisation said dogs and cats were not a risk. The WHO\u0026nbspsaid that to prevent mass abandonment of pets –\u0026nbspbut it had the opposite effect.”Consumption had also risen because people staying at home want to try more “exotic” meat, Dr Polak said.In interviews last year, patients had told Four Paws how medical professionals had advised them to consume the meat for its “warming and healing properties” thought – falsely – to ward off flu viruses and the coronavirus.The meat is particularly recommended to women after giving birth and is said to increase blood flow for women during their menstrual cycle.Animals around the world benefit as coronavirus halts tourismBut a report\u0026nbsptwo months ago by the group, which has studied the trade in the three countries, concluded there was no evidence for any of the medical benefits claimed by health professionals.“Patients are routinely advised by health practitioners of the health benefits, and vendors are reporting to us that their customers are partaking in dog meat consumption due to the ‘health benefits’,” Dr Polak said, adding that she strongly suspected doctors were now recommending it\u0026nbspeven more in view of Covid-19.In Indonesia, people widely believe dog meat cures respiratory illness –\u0026nbsplargely asthma – so demand for it in that country could soar, Dr Polak said.The animals may be strays or stolen pets, or are bought by traders\u0026nbspwho exchange them for pots and pans.Vendors in Cambodia and Vietnam stand in masks at the roadside, providing bags of the meat, which may be cooked on the spot or for customers to take home.Dogs and cats blowtorched alive at Indonesian street marketsCambodia’s capital Phnom Penh has more than 110 dog meat restaurants, many of which opened within the past\u0026nbsptwo years, Four Paws says.Since the coronavirus pandemic, the organisation’s teams found that a few had closed but most had switched to providing takeaway services.And restaurants across the country are advertising dog and cat meat dishes for delivery on food delivery websites and apps.“This is concerning because we had never seen dog and cat meat dishes being advertised on a food delivery app before the Covid-19 outbreak. It demonstrates that the dog-meat industry is adapting to the increased consumption at home and increased ease of obtaining dog and cat meat, even during a lockdown,” said Dr Polak.“The insanitary conditions of the cat and dog meat trade, coupled with the contamination risks of having so many different animal species caged and killed alongside one another, present the perfect breeding ground for new and deadly diseases\u0026nbsplike Covid-19.“The rampant trade and live animal markets across southeast Asia are ticking time bombs. If governments do not act now and shut down these cruel markets, the next global pandemic might originate in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.”Last week China\u0026nbspclassified dogs as pets, not livestock, for the first time – a move campaigners hope could signal an end to that country’s dog and cat meat trade.Four Paws, which is campaigning for a total ban on dog and cat meat, has long warned of the risk of the spread of rabies from the pet meat trade.The news comes as The Independent’s Stop the Wildlife Trade campaign calls for an international effort to tighten restrictions on wet markets to reduce the risk of future pandemics.A recent study has proposed that the virus might have travelled from bats to humans via stray dogs.cat and dog meat\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They will then be returned to their shelters in the camp.When asked if more boats carrying the Muslim-minority Rohingya could be adrift at sea, Ms Rayburn said: “It’s possible. Some human rights agencies have suggested that there are other boats.“Anecdotally we have seen an uptick in\u0026nbspRohingya trying to get to Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand by boat. Very often these attempts will happen in the dry season when the seas are slightly calmer and slightly less dangerous.“So it’s possible but it’s very difficult issue to keep track of.

Though I’m sad, it’s very important to tell our terrible story to the whole world. One of my children was killed crossing the border, she was 11. My other child was only seven. When we crossed it was very cold and raining, we didn’t have enough food so my child got sick and was taken by disease.’1818 Minara, 20, with baby ShomimaShomima was seven days old when the photo was taken. ‘One day, if it’s safe, of course we want to go home. I miss my home, my family. I miss my cows and my normal life. But at least this is safer,’ she says. In October 2018, a proposed repatriation deal was made between the Bangladesh and Myanmar governments. The deal was made against the wishes of many Rohingya, some of whom spoke of being ‘terrified’ at being sent back. As a result of mounting concern amongst NGOs, human rights groups and the UNHCR, repatriation did not take place at this time. For now the Rohingya remain in limbo just across the border from Myanmar, and for women and girls in the camps of Cox’s Bazar life remains precariousThe dangerous crossings will likely continue as long as the issues the Rohingya face in Bangladesh and Myanmar remain,\u0026nbspMs Rayburn, from Save the Children, cautioned.“Very often when we see these upticks in Rohingya and Bangladeshis trying to take these routes to either Malaysia, Thailand or Indonesia, the response is to focus on\u0026nbspshoring up borders and coast guards to prevent these attempts from happening, but they will continue to happen for as long as the root causes of why people feel compelled to leave are still there.“When we’ve spoken to Rohingya, it comes up many times that the reason they feel compelled to take this journey, which is incredibly dangerous, is because they don’t see any future in the camps.“The conditions are unsafe and unsanitary, and\u0026nbsptheir children have limited access to school. As long as those conditions are not addressed, and as long as they can’t go home because Myanmar hasn’t resolved the root causes in Rakhine state, it would be very difficult to prevent people from taking this kind of action.”She added: “A couple of Rohingya I spoke to in February who had been on a boat that capsized\u0026nbspsaid they planned to attempt to go again as soon as they can, because they couldn’t see any options for themselves in Cox’s Bazar.“It will keep happening as long as we don’t find a solution for the Rohingya.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The sign that adorned the entrance of the market, a landmark of Wuhan city, has also been removed.As residents prepare for a return to work this week, business owners at the market will have nowhere to go. “Since all businesses need to apply for permission from the government before they restart operation, it will be impossible for these businesses to gain the government’s approval,” said Michael, who used to own a fruit stand a few blocks away from the Huanan Seafood Market and refused to give his real name.Wildlife trade was once a lucrative and thriving industry in China, but the suspicion that the current coronavirus pandemic started in\u0026nbspexotic animals smuggled into the country has forced the government to crack down on the decades-old trade.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Beijing rolled out a strict ban on the breeding and consumption of wild animals, as it tried to prevent another outbreak from happening. This was a general guidance issued from the central government, with the power to enforce the law ultimately lying with provincial or municipal officials.Several other provinces have followed suit, and the southern industrial hub Shenzhen announced a ban on the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat on Thursday, becoming the first Chinese city to do so.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Wuhan, local officials have been increasingly strict in their crackdown on businesses engaged in wildlife trade or breeding. On 3 March, local authorities in Wuhan carried out a comprehensive disinfection campaign across the entire Huanan Seafood Market.However, recent reports suggest that despite the regional governments\u0027\u0026nbspefforts to put an end to wildlife trade, illicit commercial activities are still happening at public markets in certain parts of China. Earlier this week, the Mail on Sunday reported that thousands of customers flooded an indoor market in the southwestern city of Guilin in China, as living dogs and cats were crammed into cages while dead bats and scorpions were on display.Andrew Huang, a Chinese culinary expert, says one of the reasons why it’s hard for the Chinese government to completely end the consumption and trading of wildlife in China is because such behaviours have become part of decades-olds tradition in the country.“Different parts of China have their specific traditions of consuming wildlife for different purposes,” Mr Huang explains. “In the northeastern part of China, bears and deers are a big part of the local delicacies while in southwestern China, bats and pangolins are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The steady demand for such wildlife has nurtured a lucrative supply chain, including some businesses that focus on breeding specific types of wild animals.”Mr Huang thinks that the current crackdown on wildlife trade and consumption might temporarily prevent relevant practices from happening in public markets, but it will be hard to completely eliminate it from the Chinese culture.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even if the government has banned wildlife trade and consumption, the tradition won’t be so easily wiped out.”‘No need to close the entire market’In Wuhan, while the plan to shut down the Huanan Seafood Market is underway, local residents have different opinions about how to handle the market where the coronavirus pandemic began.“Honestly, wildlife trade isn’t the main commercial activity at the Hunan Seafood Market, as most of the sellers still focus on selling different kinds of seafood,” says Ms Xu, who was a frequent shopper at the market until it was shut down.Since the market is right next to one of the major train stations in the city, she says, it has become the regional hub for selling fruits and seafood, as well as wildlife. Due to the large number of visitors coming from different parts of Hubei province, it also became the ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus.“I think even if the government wants to ban wildlife trade, they don’t have to shut down the entire seafood market,” Ms Xu says. “This will have a huge impact on local restaurants and businesses that have long relied on the market for their seafood supplies.”Ms Xu says that instead of forcing dozens of business owners to lose their livelihoods, the Chinese government should focus more on tackling the ongoing pandemic itself. “I wish the government could conduct more coronavirus tests on citizens, because I suspect many of them could still be asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They usually include:Hayfever sufferers may also experience itching around the face and mouth or an itchy feeling inside the roof of the mouth and a burning sensation in the throat.It may also cause headaches and wheezing, but these are less common symptoms, along with a sore throat.Some of the symptoms of coronavirus may cross over with hay fever in a few cases, so its worth understanding how to tell the dference.We asked allergy expert Max Wiseberg, of Haymax, to explain...He said: “If your mucus is clear, thin and watery it is more likely to be hay fever.”“And although it is called hay fever, a fever is unusual, whereas it is possible with coronavirus.”Max added: “Despite its name, hay fever is not contagious, whereas the coronavirus is - another reason for determining which one you are suffering from.”“To help prevent the spread of coronavirus, it’s important to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth and wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least  seconds.”“Awareness of the coronavirus is key, so it’s crucial to avoid people who are sick and be aware of symptoms.Almost half of all those with hay fever also suffer with asthma - and pollen can irritate the airways and worsen symptoms.Coronavirus is also a respiratory illness and is also understood to cause symptoms which can exacerbate asthma and increase the risk of potentially le-threatening attacks.Emma Rubach, head of health advice at Asthma UK, told The Sun Online: “Coronavirus can cause respiratory problems for anyone.But for the .million people in the UK with asthma, respiratory viruses bring an increased risk of asthma symptoms and potentially le threatening asthma attacks.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Emma said that this could leave people with asthma particularly concerned, however there are practical steps to staying well.She added: It’s vital that you take your preventer inhalerdaily as prescribed to build up protection in your airways over time and reduce your risk of an asthma attackyou do catch a virus.Keep your reliever inhalernearby, so you can use ityour symptoms get worse.Wash your hands frequently to reduce the risk of catching a virus and avoid sharing towels, cups or other household items with someone who might be affected.The pollen season across the UK is separated into three main sections.From late March to mid-May is tree pollen season, while mid-May to July is grass pollen season and weed pollen season runs from the end of June until September.Grass pollen is the most common allergy and affects  per cent of people with hay fever, according to Allergy UK.Pollen counts tend to be higher in early morning and late evening, although they can sometimes be high all day long.If the grass is damp, the pollen peak will be later in the morning because the water evaporates before the pollen is released.Pollen rises in the air during the day and then descends at night, as the air cools.In rural areas, the evening peak tends to occur between pm and pm but in the city, where the air stays warmer for longer, the pollen descends later and levels tend to peak between pm and midnight or even later, which is why you may wake up sneezing in the night.Experts say that one of the best ways to combat hay fever is to stay indoors.And with the government urging people to socially distance themselves by staying home as much as possible, that should make this years hay fever season a little easier to cope with.Butyou do go outside there are some measures you can take to ease those symptoms.Max Wiseberg added: “Tie your hair up and wear a hat when outside to prevent pollen particles being caught in your hair and wear wraparound sunglasses to prevent pollen particles coming in contact with your eyes.Keep well hydrated and eat lots of fruit and vegetables to stay healthy and support your immune system.Shower at night before sleeping to remove pollen particles from your hair and body.”He continued: Close windows and doors to prevent pollen blowing into your home and vacuum the house regularly  - especially beds and fabrics - to remove pollen particles.Dry your clothes indoors rather than outdoors to prevent pollen particles being blown onto the clothes by the outside wind.”You should also make sure any pets are well groomed and shampooed, as they can carry pollen particles in their fur, and keep them out of the room where you sleep.There are also conventional over-the-counter medicines which can combat hay fever symptoms.Antihistamine tablets and capsules can relieve most hay fever symptoms – sneezing, itchy, runny eyes, skin irritation, itchy nose and throat – but are less effective for nasal congestion, according to Max.Antihistamine nasal sprays can quickly ease itching, sneezing and watering but generally only proof against mild symptoms.Steroid nasal sprays and drops help reduce inflammation in the nose.They work best for clearing nasal symptoms – itching, sneezing, watering  congestion – and sprays sometimes clear eye symptoms too.Eye drops may reduce itchy, watering, swollen eyes.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve never been so pleased to see my copy spiked.We now know from the PM himself just how close he came to death. But had things turned out dferently, my first sentence would still ring true.Boris would have paid the ultimate price for Covid-.The killer virus was spawned in China’s primitive “wet markets” and concealed by the country’s secretive communist regime and blamed by China on America and the West.Beijing’s claim of only , dead is a sick joke. The true figure could be ten times as high — or more.This, remember, is the regime that still lies about the thousands slaughtered in the  Tiananmen Square massacre.Yet China, having destroyed lives and livelihoods around the globe, is emerging as the big winner from its own pandemic.Like vultures hovering over roadkill, leaders of the world’s second-biggest economy are eyeing up the casualties of this made in-China calamity.Covid- risks opening the door to Beijing’s dominance over world trade and commerce, at unimaginable cost to our freedoms and democracy.Rattled world leaders, from Australia to Germany, are drafting emergency laws to prevent China mopping up crown jewels in pharmaceuticals, minerals, articial intelligence and robot technology.But it is probably too late. The West has turned a blind eye to China’s decades of industrial espionage and its cut-price grab for market share.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is utterly dependent on cheap, heavily subsidised Chinese components and the VW and Mercedes car sales that account for a third of their profits.Suicidally, it will see Chinese cash as a passport out of the crisis.“We have grown too idle and too comfortable to want to do the things the Chinese do for us,” says a Cabinet insider.The world stood silent as China’s Belt And Road programme gobbled up key ports and industries, rare earth minerals and rich farmland across Africa and the Third World.Beijing is now rubbing its hands at the prospect of fresh bargains.Household-name firms here and in Europe are struggling to survive the lockdown. Some will never reopen their doors.The best might end up in Beijing at fire-sale prices.China has already seized a big stake in the UK with its richly subsidised £billion contract for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.Telecoms giant Huawei has its sticky fingers all over our sensitive G superhighway — a decision which must now surely be reversed.The image of communist China as a civilised equal partner is a dangerous fantasy.“China is not and never will be our friend,” a senior minister warns. “But it is the only one with ready cash and all our markets have collapsed because of something China started.“Our economy is being shattered and it is their fault. The idea of selling them some of our best companies is horrying.”China’s own economy has been hammered too. But it remains a ruthless totalitarian state which brooks no opposition.The brutal incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims in “re-education” camps is a blot on the civilised world. So is the trade in human organs from executed prisoners.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealWho will stop China becoming the world’s dominant power It will be hard for our liberal elite to swallow, but the only answer is Donald Trump.The American President has already cracked down on China’s trade and currency cheating. Democrat rival Joe Biden — backed by peace-at-any-price Barack Obama — would kowtow to Beijing.At this pivotal moment in world history, it is reassuring to know President Trump has a high regard for our Prime Minister.Once Boris is back on his feet and coronavirus begins to fade, he must join forces with the world’s greatest superpower and address the smiling menace of Chinese President Xi Jinping.As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.Boris was hardest hit, followed by chief of staff Dominic Cummings, who is only now ing to work after a fortnight in bed.A dozen others, including Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and No Press chief Lee Cain, went down like skittles.So who was the super-spreader The finger of suspicion is pointed at health supremo Matt Hancock, first in and energetically first out of self- isolation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the moment before that.And probably every spare moment since he was obliged to leave the Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados, to go through the motions at this old ITV circus, for the th time of asking.Britain’s Got Talent, which began with Ant and Dec sentimentally evoking all the things they love about this great country of ours.The White Clfs of Dover, Blackpool Tower, Edinburgh Castle, Russian sausage dog dancers, a Belgian contortionist, from Got Talent Espana, who scuttled across the stage in the spider position. That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz.

It’s no wonder so many bosses and workers are confused – lawyers are too!Without statutes in place and with regulations changing, it can be hard to provide a definitive answer. The Government has announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means thatyou both agree, your employer can put you on temporary leave .This applies when they are unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of Covid-. If you are furloughed, you will be paid  per cent of your wages by the Government, up to a monthly cap of £,.It sounds straightforward, but your own unique circumstances can make things tricky.  I have been inundated with questions from people who have been furloughed, had their salary cut or lost their jobs.Here, I have provided my answers to some of your most common queries.Q I STARTED a new job shortly before the lock-down. My new company has advised me it cannot pay me the  per cent government pay because I didn’t start before February . What can I do A Annoyingly for you, your new company is almost certainly right. Unless you were on the payroll by February  they are not legally bound to extend the furlough scheme to you. There are talks about this being changed and lots of pressure on the Government because there are a lot of people in your position. In the meantime, you are entitled to Universal Credit — apply now.Q I WAS late getting to work at a food processing plant due to a change in bus timetables caused by the lockdown. My boss said this was a disciplinary offence and fired me. Is this legal A This is probably not legal. If you have been employed for two years or more this counts as unfair dismissal. If you took your employer to an employment tribunal you would have a good chance of winning.  If you haven’t been employed there for  months you would still be entitled to pay for your notice period.  It is possible you could bring a claim for breach of contract as your employer has almost certainly failed to uphold their own disciplinary procedures. You may also be entitled to a claim for discrimination.  Write to this firm making it clear the country is watching their behaviour — as am I.Q I AM on furlough but my employer is holding back a week’s wages I earned before I was furloughed, saying I will get them when my employment starts again. Can he do this  A Your employer cannot do this, unless it was agreed in a contract. You were promised this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with you being furloughed. I have had a number of messages about this unlawful practice and I understand employers are trying to protect cashflow. Butyou were promised this money your firm is not entitled to withhold it.  It may be that, like many others, you will have to work with your employerthey need that money to stay afloat and protect your job, but make sure they put in writing that the money will be forthcoming in due course. Waiting a while for the money may be better than your company going bust.Q AM I entitled to get another job – say, in a supermarket – while I am on furlough from my employer A I have been inundated with people asking this, but the law is not clear. My view is that unless the contract you have with your current employer specically states you cannot take another job , there is no reason why you cannot during this time. There is nothing as it stands in legislation that prevents you from doing this. The government regulationsare not clear and need clarication.  Importantly, disclosure to your current employer is critical. Do not accept another job without giving clear written notice to your current employer that you are taking up other employment while furloughed.Q MY employer wants me to accept a ten per cent pay cut. I checked my contract and I don’t believe they have the power to do this. Do I have a way of resisting this A Your employer cannot unilaterally decide to cut your wages. You have signed a contract and they have promised to pay you. But these are unprecedented times and there is legal provision which may, in certain circumstances, allow employers to sack you and then,necessary, re-employ you on a reduced salary. Multiple employers have asked staff to take a reduction in order for them to survive. The critical thing is thatyou accept such an offer it must have an end date, in writing. You can’t be forced to accept a contract change, including a salary cut. But be warned thatyou do not, your employer can put you on furlough, which will only cover  per cent of your salary.Q I RESIGNED from my job but my new one has fallen through due to the virus. Where can I get help  A I am afraid you will have to claim Universal Credit. It may be worth writing to your old employer to seethere is work still availble, but your legal remedies are limited. The Citizens Advice Bureau is updating its advice on this all the time.Q MY EMPLOYER has gone into administration. Can I still be furloughed A The law makes clear that administrators, independent professionals responsible for either salvaging a bankrupt company or ensuring creditors are paid, can apply to the government furlourgh scheme to ensure an income for staff. However, the administrator will probably focus on attempting to pay creditors and shareholders. Do not let them do this. Get together with co-employees and write to the administrator insisting you’ll not be forgotten and nor will their behaviour.Q I’VE HAD to cancel my holiday and my employer needs me to work during the time I had booked off. Usually we are not entitled to carry annual leave into the next year, butthey are requiring me to work, surely I must have the right to do so A Good news, the Government has amended regulations so workers can carry over up to four weeks holiday into the next two holiday years. This applies where it has not been possible for you to take some or all of your leave because of the virus. However, it has to be because you were required to work.Q I BECAME self-employed in February. Am I entitled to government grants A It looks like you are not, but this may change. You need to have accounts for   to be entitled to assistance. But this situation is moving, so don’t give up hope.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Q I’M A zero-hours worker. Am I still entitled to be put on furlough  My employer is closed so I have no shts but nothing has been mentioned about furloughing. A The furlough scheme covers zero-hour contract workers so your employer should make an application on your behalf. Get in touch and ask them to explain their policy. It costs them nothing to offer you furlough so I do not understand why they have not.Q I WORK in a shop and my employer has made no effort to make the environment safe for the workers. In other shops I have seen screens at tills and employees issued with gloves and masks. We have none of that. I don’t feel safe. Am I entitled to stop working without risking my job A It is shocking that there are no specic health and safety regulations protecting workers like you which have the full force of law. I do not have a clear answer about whether you are entitled to refuse to go to workthe business is open and offering essential services. However, in due course your business failing to make the environment safe could be grounds for constructive dismissalyou were to make the decision to walk away. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to write to your line manager asking them to provide safety equipment, making it clear the environment is unsafe and explaining that you will be considering your optionsadequate safety measures are not introduced.Q I WANT to go on furlough, but my employer has cut my hours by half. How can I make them furlough me so I can get  per cent of my pay instead of  per cent A Your boss can’t just slash your hours by half, that is a straightforward breach of contract. If there is no work for you to do then furlough should be offered to you. Write to your employer at once asking for them to explain why they think this is lawful. I look forward to their answer.Q I CAN’T work because I have to shield myself due to health reasons. I asked my employer to furlough me and they said they couldn’t because I can’t work, so I am currently on unpaid leave. Is this fair A  This all depends on your circumstances. If you are able to work from home, and are healthy enough to do so, your employer should offer you this option. If your employer is unable to operate, or there is no work you could doyou did not have to shield yourself, then you should be offered furlough. Butthe business is an essential service that has remained open, and you have to attend work in person, the remedy is to apply for statutory sick pay .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Half of those , deaths are blamed on coronavirus.We do not know how the other half died, although some will have missed le-saving healthcare because of the ­pandemic.What we do know is that this hideous virus is killing the economy.The Office for Budget Responsibilitywarns a three-month shutdown will slash growth by more than a third, push unemployment up by two million and raise borrowing by an eye-watering  per cent.Lockdown has destroyed Britain’s “jobs miracle”, put paid to a fragile “Brexit bounce” and triggered what could be the worst depression in living memory.“It is important people know there will be hardship ahead,” warned Chancellor Rishi Sunak, an under- statementever there was one.On your one-hour daily exercise break, you can see the tragedy unfolding.Once-thriving restaurants and bars, busy offices and shops and key construction sites are locked and bolted.Behind every door is a personal and economic tragedy.Despite a torrent of taxpayers’ cash unleashed by Mr Sunak, many will never reopen. Some are already bust. Le will never be quite the same again.The Treasury is stumping up billions to pay furloughed full-time workers, help the self-employed and offer Universal Credit to the very large number who slip between the cracks.We are piling shedloads on to our already massive national debt. For many firms and iniduals this is a devastating blow from which they may never recover, financially or mentally.Lives lost from delayed emergency care, alcoholism, drugs and domestic abuse have rocketed.Together with fatalities from other causes — mostly poverty and despair — they could dwarf the toll from the virus.Some children’s le chances will be wrecked by a long break from school or, worse, from being cooped up with violent family members.Those who keep their jobs may be forced into severe pay cuts. Costs will spill down through the generations.Not everyone is suffering.Public sector jobs and pensions are secure, for the time being.Some with savings, decent homes and jobs they can do from home might actually be enjoying Easter with their families at their side.Breadwinners forced to stay in instead of eating out or flying abroad will have spare cash in their pockets at the end of the month. And some will have grabbed Rishi Sunak’s offer of  per cent pay to put their feet up at the taxpayers’ expense.But it all adds up to a crimson bottom line that our children and grandchildren will have to meet over decades to come.

But what will remain — and at what cost Downing Street, without its most important figure at the helm, must find a way to save Britain from destitution without being blamed for “putting money before lives”.It is a challenge only a loony Corbynite leftie would wish on their worst enemy.But to govern is to choose.And despite having just escaped his own near-death experience, it is impossible to see it happening without Boris Johnson’s say-so.The PM knows there will be questions to answer once all this is over.They are already coming thick and fast — on testing, NHS capacity and protective equipment for NHS staff.These need to be settled fast — at literally any cost.We will then need an inquiry into the failure of so-called “experts” to see this coming.We will want a detailed explanation from the Public Health England quango which focused costly resources on obesity and ersity, rather than the pandemic they war-gamed four years ago.Why, for instance, were they so slow to allow non-NHS specialists into the fast-accelerating battle against Covid- A gargantuan rise in debt and unemployment. A terrying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But eventhat startling optimism — which we struggle to share — is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after  will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in. The public must consider it before it rails against any relaxing of the lockdown in case more Covid victims die.No one wants more lives lost. But the debate is not lives versus money and jobs. Many will also die from the hardships of poverty, unemployment, tax rises and spending cutsthe economy is kept paralysed much longer.The behavioural scientists advising the Government rightly fear that the public will doubt whether the lockdown’s success in protecting the NHS is still worth itthe recession it triggers kills thousands and destroys the health ­service’s funding anyway.We are not there yet. We do not yet knowUK deaths have peaked, though hospital admissions are flattening and the NHS does now look likely to cope.But the crunch point, where a date is set to slowly release Britain from house arrest, cannot wait much longer.Labour will blame the Tories, but all of these pandemic risks were pointed out as far back as  when Labour were in power.Boris, who became Prime Minister only nine months ago, was occupied with other matters until his December landslide.There are some “green shoots”, to quote one of our medical experts.The NHS now has spare capacity. There is no longer a risk of it being overwhelmed.This was one of the key reasons for the draconian crackdown — to avoid an unmanageable “spike” in crisis admissions.That risk has diminished.

Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a balance between the health of the nation and our economy.It came as Mr Hancock and Piers Morgan had a heated discussion on Good Morning Britain, with the host repeatedly blasting the Health Secretary for claiming the country was ready for the pandemic to hit.Piers had also accused the Government of lagging behind on PPE, testing, we are having to go cap in hand begging manufacturers to make ventilators...You got up in January in the House of Commons and said, we are completely prepared.Mr Hancock explained how the virus was a new one and had a dferent impact than has ever been seen before.Getting fullgowns which were never needed before was a challenge, he added.But the conversation soon turned into bickering as Piers accused Mr Hancock of avoiding questions.Stop playing that game, he snapped. You are trying to buy yourself time.I would admire you moreyou just stood up and said we werent prepared.And he told him he would not take a  per cent pay cut like New Zealands PM Jacinda Ardern has done.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealBut Mr Hancock said: That misjudges the public mood, I think, Piers.I am now going to answer the previous question...But Piers interrupted to say: I actually run this show.You do your job, and Ill do mine.Mr Hancock appeared to begin to lose his temper, hitting back: If you did your job, you would let me answer.I decide what I say as health secretary.If you interrupt me again I will just keep talking. So don’t, thank you.It is gruelling for us all, is costing £billion a day and wrecking the economy. But it would be an even greater catastrophe to relax it early, suffer a second wave of infections and have to do it all again.Aside from the new toll of lost lives, many businesses which limp through one shutdown will not survive a second.So Dominic Raab’s decision to extend our virtual house arrest for three weeks seems fair while it remains unclear how successfully we are battling Covid-.He, and preferably a fit-again Boris Johnson, must time this exactly right. As the Foreign Secretary said, we are at a “delicate and dangerous stage”. But it is vital to review it every day.If the statistics show clearer progress in, say, another week, the Government must prioritise setting a date for partially reopening schools and some firms.We need light at the end of the tunnel.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To have to watch as they sob their goodbyes is worse.At this horrendous moment, Adam asked the doctorthere was anything weird of wacky he had heard about.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealIt was a desperate plea that I knew he couldnt answer, he said.In the waiting room, the doctor, Dave, suggested there was one last thing he could try - a technique called proning, where the patient is placed on their stomach for  hours.He said it might help Staceys lungs transfer oxygen into the bloodstream more efficiently but warned it could lead to a fatal heart attack.They agreed they had nothing to lose and took the decision to lie Stacey on her front.Incredibly, Stacey made a miraculous recovery and the tubes were gradually removed from her body, followed by the oxygen.Adam said: One doctor told her she was the hospitals success story. Another said she hadnt just beaten the odds, but smashed them out of the park.Adams account comes as experts said doctors should consider flipping all coronavirus patients who need oxygen onto their fronts.The proning technique has been used for unconscious patients in intensive care units for years.New guidance from the Intensive Care Society said the technique should now also be used for conscious patients who have the deadly virus to help them avoid the need for ventilation.It added it would not be suitable for everyone, including obese patients or pregnant women.Its a simple intervention that experts are now saying doctors should use for all coronavirus patients in hospital - whether they are unconscious or not.Doctors in ICU departments across the world are - in teams of up to six medics - reguarlarly turning patients on to their fronts.Often a patient is left on their front for up to  hours, before spending the rest of the day on their backs.The results, experts have said, are dramatic.Patients in severe conditions, with fluid-filled lungs and struggling to get enough oxygen, have been seen to make quick improvements.The reasons the technique works are complex.The vast majority of a persons lungs are actually at the back of their body, so lying on the front opens them up.The heart weighs less heavily on the lungs, again leaving more space for the lungs to work.Other organs including the spleen, guts and intestines, dont press up against the lungs, as they do when we lie on our backs.And alveoli- the tiny air sacs in the lungs that inflate - isd improved thanks to less compression, experts believe.Clinical trials will be needed to say for sure how much benefit the technique brings, but experts suggest there is an advantage.Prof Mike Grocott, critical care consultant and vice president of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, told The Times: The new bit is that its now being adopted outside the intensive care unit.Its come along relatively rapidly and its been quite widely adopted.Last week JK Rowling revealed she had suffered from suspected coronavirus before a YouTube video demonstrating breathing techniques helped her to recover.In the video Sarfaraz Munshi, a doctor at Queens Hospital, Essex, advised taking five deep breaths, holding each for five seconds. He then said to take a sixth breath, hold that for five seconds before doing a cough.He said to do this twice and then flip on to the stomach for ten minutes while taking deeper breaths than normal.To donate to Whipps Cross Hospital, please click here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So regardless of how you look at it... theres an extra , deaths a week due to this disease.He said throughout Taiwan there had only been five deaths: Heres an example of a great country that is distributing masks to everybody.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealMr Howard tweeted earlier this week that the scientic evidence was clear on face masks.He wrote: Most scientic evidence points in the same direction: keep your droplets to yourself - wear a mask.Our teams review of the literature found substantial evidence in favour of widespread mask use to reduce community transmission.The key insight is that most discussions assume that the purpose of the mask is to protect the wearer, since this is what all doctors learn about in medical school.But actually masks work far better at blocking the infection at the source. This is called ‘source control’.”Mr Howard is not alone in his support of face masks, Professor Benjamin Cowling from Hong Kong University agreed it could help slow the spread. Prof Cowling said: “If face masks are used on a lot of people in crowded areas, I think it would have some effect on public transmission, and at the moment we’re looking for every small measure we can to reduce transmission - it adds up.”The WHO put out advice against wearing face masks, not because they did not necessarily give people any protection, but because they created a  sense of security and reduced crucial stocks for health care workers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with another  people losing their lives.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Britain also surpassed ,.And he laid out five tests that Britain must meet before the rules can be changed.But no specic numbers were mentioned, and no plan for an exit strategy was mentioned either.Mr Raab said that lting any lockdown measures without those tests being met would risk a damaging second wave - which would harm health and the economy even more.He added: We must keep up this effort for a little while longer.We have sacriced far too much to ease up now.We are beginning to see the evidence that our efforts are starting to pay off - there is light at the end of the tunnel.If we rush, we would risk wasting all the sacrice and progress that has been madePlease, please, stay home, save lives, so we canto normal lives as soon as possible.Now is not the moment to give the coronavirus a second chance.Lets stick together, lets see this through, and defeat the coronavirus for good.That means that the emergency measures first announced by Boris Johnson on March  will stay in place until at least May .They will be reviewed again in May, when ministers will decide whether to lt any, but Mr Raab did not give any indication of whether they would be.We cant give a definitive time frame, he said.That would be to prejudge evidence, that would be an irresponsible thing to do.It means that rules on going outside the house, a ban on seeing friends or family outside of the household, and on exercising just once a day, will stay in place for now.It comes after Mr Raab held an emergency COBRA meeting with the other devolved nations this afternoon to rubber stamp the decision.They considered scientic advice which concluded that the shutdown measures had helped Britain control the pandemic, but experts said it was not yet time to ease off on them.However, Mr Raab indicated tonight that some measures could be toughened up - as others were relaxed.He told the nation this evening: We will look to adjust the measures to make them as effective as possible in protecting public health while allowing some economic and social activity to resume.But we will only do it when the evidence demonstrates it is safe to do it.It could involve relaxing measures in some areas while strengthening measures in other areas.Everyone in Government recognises the huge social and impact that the lockdown is having, he stressed.But a second peak would have ato another lockdown, he warned too - something the country would be desperate to avoid.New data showing the UKs total death rate - including all deaths inside and outside hospitals - puts Britain on course for the third highest death rate in the world.The only countries recording more at the moment are the US and Spain.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealBut Mr Raab again refused to give the public any indication of when the measures could be lted.The Government earlier this week refused to set out a plan as Labours new leader Sir Keir Starmer has demanded.Instead they claimed that the public must focus on staying inside for now.And that any discussion of the future would distract from the job at hand.Health Secretary Matt Hancock lost his temper with journalists earlier when he was asked again when we may see a relaxation of the measures.He snapped back: Please, please let me answer.And he stressed that what ministers said about the lockdown had a direct impact on the number of deaths that were being reported every single day.Patrick Vallance, the UKs chief Scientic Adviser said the rate of transmission was likely to be less than one, now, thanks to social distancing measures.But there is still an increase in the spread of the infection in hospitals and in social care settings, he warned.The overall message is that cases are at least flattening and maybe decreasing, he said.However, working from home and other measures would likely to have to continue in some form in the future to keep the spread down.Once were past the peak there will be decisions about which ones to relax, and which ones not to relax, he explained.He said it was not likely that the lockdown would be lted using dferent groups of people, as has been suggested by some - like the old or the healthy.Once were at that stage then you can start to think about which of the measures can make the most sense to release...To do that in a way that starts moving more towards normal and not to segregate on certain groups.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Professor Chris Whitty also urged people who were sick and needed urgent medical care not to avoid hospitals.He said that even though the NHS was stretched, anyone who needs help must not be afraid of asking for it.People die for many reasons in epidemics - they can also include people who died because they stayed at home because they worried going into hospital was dangerous.It is really critical for people to realisethey are in a medical emergency… things like that could be le threatening.Aside from the new toll of lost lives, many businesses which limp through one shutdown will not survive a second.So Dominic Raab’s decision to extend our virtual house arrest for three weeks seems fair while it remains unclear how successfully we are battling Covid-.He, and preferably a fit-again Boris Johnson, must time this exactly right. As the Foreign Secretary said, we are at a “delicate and dangerous stage”. But it is vital to review it every day.If the statistics show clearer progress in, say, another week, the Government must prioritise setting a date for partially reopening schools and some firms.We need light at the end of the tunnel.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And that’s OK.In fact, it’s more than OK. It means freedom and travelling and seeing people.The messaging has been so strong because the Government, in the early days of this pandemic, predicted the British public would be very bad at following such draconian rules.After all, we’re a country of liberty-loving, anti-authority types who want control over our own lives.Government forecasts predicted  per cent of folk would still go to work and  per cent of kids would still show up at school.It’s been nowhere near that. We have behaved.And our collective obedience when it came to lockdown — not easy for so many folk cooped up in small flats — was only hardened when we saw the man we have entrusted with our health over this period knocked down himself.If big, bouncy, bold Boris could end up in intensive care, so too could our dad or brother or best friend — or even us.That’s why it’s concerning that many political insiders suggest the Government is waiting for public opinion to lead us out of lockdown.Trust me, that’s not going to happen. We are waiting on our leaders to talk us through where we go from here. We will listen with the right degree of scepticism and change our behaviour accordingly.That’s how we went from a nation of pub-frequenting, sport and concert obsessives to million people who happily down pint after pint on the couch while quizzing our friends on Zoom.We’re going to have to be sensible and brave in the coming weeks.And there will be many aspects to this new way of living that we should all try to embrace.Respect the need for folk to have more personal space no acceptance of filthy habits such as spitting on the streets or coughing into others’ faces on the bus an acknowledgement that people who are ill must recuperate at home and spend their recovery working from home in many jobs.The best-case scenario: Post-corona society in  will herald a new era to live more healthily and respectfully.SOME irony that ITV’s best show in years is Quiz – a drama going behind the scenes of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire , the series that propelled the broadcaster into the Noughties with gusto and reinvigorated the entire UK telly industry.I came away believing that hapless and likeable Major Charles Ingram, played by Matthew Macfadyen was clearly wrongly convicted.He deserves to be handed his £million.

Speaking at the press conference where the government confirmed it was extending the UKaposs lockdown for at least three weeks, Sir Patrick Vallance said that the way out of the pandemic was through the development of a vaccine. But he warned that in the interim we could see changes in how the lockdown was being administered. In his answer Sir Patrick also suggested certain measures - like working from home - could be around for a while. He said there may be a number of measures that need to continue in order to allow that to be suppressed and controlled whilst vaccines and therapeutics come along. He told reporters: There will be some changes [to how we live] I think that need to take place, that have already taken place, around things like home working, that are going to be important to maintain that ability to break transmission. Sir Patrick Vallance said: “The way out of this is vaccines and therapeutics. “Those are going to be critically important. There are vaccine programmes across the world… probably four of those are in the clinic now. “There are also therapeutic programmes, old drugs and people making new drugs, and those are going to be critically important in terms of reducing the effects of this disease and potentially reducing transmission. “So vaccines and therapeutics are critically important, no question about it, and the UK of course is somewhere where a lot of that work is going on. “Now where we are now is the social distancing measures are needed to reduce the levels right down to a low level. “At that point there may be decisions about which ones to relax and which ones not to relax. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab warned that lting restrictions now would risk a dangerous second peak of Covid-. Mr Raab, who is deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from the virus, said the original three-month timeline set down by Mr Johnson to come through the peak of the virus was broadly still the outline. The Cabinet minister told reporters there is light at the end of the tunnel but refused to set out a definitive time frame for easing the lockdown measures, stressing that lting them now would only lead to a second lockdown. He said: The Prime Minister said at the outset that it would take three months to come through the peak and I think that, broadly, is still the outline. We canapost give a definitive time frame, that would be to prejudge the evidence, that wouldnapost be a responsible thing to do. But our message to the British public is: there is light at the end of tunnel, we are making progress, but at the same time we must keep up the social distancing measures. Mr Raab said ministers and scientists must be confident there will be no second wave of infections, and that more widespread testing needed to be put in place alongside solid evidence that infections were falling.  The worst thing we could do right now is to ease up too soon, allow a second peak of the virus to hit the NHS and to hit the British people, he said at the daily press briefing. It would be the worst outcome not just for public health but for the economy and for our country as a whole. Mr Raab said there were still issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and in care homes, adding: The very clear advice we received is that any change to our social distancing measures now would risk a signicant increase in the spread of the virus. That would threaten a second peak of the virus and substantially increase the number of deaths. It would undo the progress we have made to date and as a result would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.  Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust the current measures. They are: - Protect the NHSaposs ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK - A sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak - Reliable data from Government scientic advisers showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board - Confidence that testing capacity and personal protective equipmentare in hand with supply able to meet future demand - Confidence that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections. Mr Raab said the rate of infection - the R value - was almost certainly below one in the community, meaning infected people were passing the disease on to fewer than one other person on average. But overall we still donapost have the infection rate down as far as we need to, he said. Ministers agreed the need to prolong social distancing measures following meetings of the Cabinet and the Governmentaposs emergency committee Cobra.  But Walesaposs First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the decision to extend lockdown before Mr Raab . It comes as the Department of Health said the Covid- death toll in hospitals in the UK had reached , as of pm on Wednesday, up  on the figure the day before. Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned it will take time for le toto normal as a Government scientic adviser questioned whether ministers had done enough work on an exit strategy. Professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London said: I think thereaposs a lot of discussion. I would like to see action accelerated. We need to put in place an infrastructure, a command and control structure, a novel organisation for this.

Boris Johnsonaposs stand-in Dominic Raab confirmed the drastic measures will go on another three weeks, until May  at the earliest. That means police can still fine groups of two or more people for gathering outside, unless theyaposre from the same household. And you can only leave home with a reasonable excuse - shopping for necessities, exercise once a day, a medical need or work where you have to. But todayaposs extension doesnapost mean that the lockdown will end on May . Mr Raab said the overallof the lockdown could be around three months and warned it might only be adjusted rather than lted altogether. That means while schools may reopen in May or June, working from home could continue for a year. So what does todayaposs decision mean - and how and when might the government start shting restrictions in the next few weeks  Hereaposs what you need to know.How long is the UKaposs lockdown extension  The UK coronavirus lockdown has legally been extended until it is next up for review, on May .  According to the Health Protection Regulations , Health Secretary Matt Hancock must review the emergency powers every three weeks.  Does this mean the lockdown ends on May   No. You should not look at the three-week extension and think that means it will all be over in three weeks. May  was only chosen because that is theof time for each review period, stated by the law. The government can announce on May  that it is extending the lockdown - either wholly or partly - for another three weeks. Or technically the government can choose to review the measures before three weeks are up . In other words, the May  date is totally arbitrary - despite the fact it sits conveniently just before the May  VE Day bank holiday.  When will the lockdown end  Dominic Raab warned the lockdown could go on for around three months in total. Askedit would take three weeks or three months for restrictions to be eased, he said: “The Prime Minister said at the outset that it would take three months to come through the peak - and I think that broadly is still the outline.” He said government advisors SAGE will review the latest lockdown extension by the end of the month. We simply donapost know yet though. The lockdown can only end when the UK is well past the peak of coronavirus cases and deaths. Government advisors believe we may now be at that peak or slightly past it, but itaposs too early to say. If we lt too early the virus will run rampant, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock.   How will the lockdown end   The lockdown is very unlikely to be lted in one go. It will be removed a little bit of the time to prop up the economy while protecting peopleaposs lives. Mr Raab was careful to focus on “adjustments” to the lockdown rather than axing it, and said we may eventually transition out of where we are. When there is a change, he said, it could involve relaxing measures in some areas while strengthening measures in other areas. Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said some measures may have to continue until we have a vaccine - which could be a year away. He said: There may be a number of measures that need to continue in order to allow [the virus] to be suppressed and controlled whilst vaccines and therapeutics come along.  What is the government looking for to end the lockdown  Dominic Raab set out five tests that the evidence must show before lting any lockdown. The government needs to be convinced that:The NHS is able to cope There is a sustained and consistent fall in death Infections are decreasing to manageable levels Testing and PPE numbers are adequate across the country Any adjustment wonapost risk a second peak of infectionsIn what ways might restrictions be lted  Travel to outdoor spacescould be one of the first restrictions lted - as long as social distancing is properly adhered to. And schools could re-open as it is vital they take the strainparents are to go back to work. But visiting loved ones in care homes could be off the table for some time, as could reopening pubs and restaurants. And chief scientic advisor Sir Patrick Vallance indicated working from home may be one thing that has to stay in place until we get a vaccine.Ministers are looking at a range of options. Itaposs understood theyaposre considering a plan to let younger people out of lockdown earlier than older people, because they are generally less at risk and prop up the economy. Ministers are also looking at plans to reopen coffee shops or hair salons, for example, by broadening the current list of essential shops. And they are looking at the idea of a phasedto school, with classrooms outside worst-hit London and Birmingham reopening earlier than in the cities. But no final decisions have been taken.  "},{"url":null,"title":"irish pm says lifting coronavirus","story":"NewsIrish PM says lting coronavirus lockdown restrictions will take monthsIt came as a top scientist warned that the UK must keep a signicant level of social distancing until a vaccine for coronavirus is found.ShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical CorrespondentSam Roberts:,  APR NewsLeo Varadkar has been praised for his response to the crisis \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Ministers are considering proposals to open some primary and nursery schools away from the big cities from May, The Times has reported. Healthy young adults couldto work and children would head back to school under the plans. The proposals were put together by scientic advisors and Public Health England, and shown to Government ministers. They were floated more than a month after schools in the UK shut. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror Schools at the top of the list to reopen could be those in regional areas without major outbreaks of coronavirus. London and Birmingham are very much centres of the pandemic in the UK. A government source confirmed to thethat ministers are considering reopening schools at dferent times in dferent regions. But they stressed it is one idea among several being looked at and no final decision has been taken. The source said it is “not a blueprint written in stone” and any lting of restrictions would have to be approved by many people. Any change would have to go through the government’s scientic advisors SAGE and the COBRA emergency committee. The source said it’s a case of “when, not ” schools reopen but stressed “we don’t know where we’re going to be in three weeks” when the lockdown is next up for review.  The purpose of keeping schools closed has been questioned by scientists at University College London. They have suggested that the closures have reduced the predicted death rate by as little as two to four percent. Allowing young adults toto work is also considered low risk. The death rate for those in their s is thought to be around .%. One minister told The Times: People have followed the instruction to stay at home to the nth degree. Businesses have closed down, schools have closed down. This was far more than anticipated. Itaposs important that we donapost end up doing more damage with the lockdown. Weaposre looking at another three weeks of lockdown and then we can start to ease it.  Despite the report, health minister Nadine Dorries has urged journalists to stop asking about an exit strategy. She said: There is only one way we can aposexitapos full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a balance between the health of the nation and our economy. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Thursday he agreed that things will not go back to how they were, at least in the short term. He stressed the number of deaths is still far too high for any exit strategy to be set out, adding the public must instead focus on staying at home. He told Sky News: Well I think what Nadine was saying is the idea that weaposll immediately... weaposll just switch off all of the measures andto some kind of... to things exactly as they were - that is not likely in the short-term. He said Ms Dorriesapos use of the word full when referring to the lockdown was key, adding he thought the point that Nadine was making is that we will not be ing to some... just straight back exactly how things were before. This will take time. At a press briefing today Downing Street did not deny reports of the proposals, but urged against “speculation”. The PM’s spokesman said it is “really important the message to the public is clear - people need to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.” Asked directly about schools he said: “If we have anything to set out we will do so at the daily press conferences.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tory mp geoffrey cox rakes","story":"NewsTory MP Geoffrey Cox rakes in £k from second job weeks after being sackedEXCLUSIVE The former Attorney General squeezed in two weeks of lucrative work at almost £, an hour before Britain was forced in to lockdownShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  APR NewsThe former Attorney General raked in almost £, for  hours work \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Dominic Raab said the broad outline is it will still take around three months from mid-March to come through the peak of the virus.Government advisors have warned the lockdown cannot be lted until the UK is well past the peak. The First Secretary of State signalled that even when restrictions change, they are unlikely to be lted altogether all in one go. Instead he focused on what he called “adjustments” to the lockdown. Mr Raab told the daily No press conference: It could involve relaxing measures in some areas while strengthening measures in other areas. It came as the lockdown was extended by its first legally-required three week period to May . Government advisors SAGE will review the latest lockdown extension by the end of the month. But Mr Raab gave no signal they would be eased or lted altogether at that point. Askedit would take three weeks or three months for restrictions to be eased, he said: “The Prime Minister said at the outset that it would take three months to come through the peak - and I think that broadly is still the outline.” Mr Raab emphasised the UK could transition out of lockdown rather than just ending it. He said: “We’ve been very clear that we’ll take the right decisions at the right moments based on the evidence. And they may well involve a transition out of the current measures.” Boris Johnson introduced the strict curbs on le in the UK on  March, as the government sought to limit the spread of the virus.Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks.And today after meeting the government’s scientic advisors SAGE and the COBRA emergency committee, the First Secretary of State confirmed that Britainaposs lockdown would continue for  three   weeks.Any change would have to go through the government’s scientic advisors SAGE and the COBRA emergency committee. The extension means that the lockdown will be assessed again on May , raising hopes that the lockdown may be lted by VE Day on May .But a top scientist warned that the UK must keep a signicant level of social distancing until a vaccine for coronavirus is found. Prof Neil Ferguson told the BBC there was little leeway to relax measures without something... in their place - such as testing and contact tracing. Britain’s coronavirus death toll has risen to more than , after  more deaths were reported in the last  hours. Another  patients died in hospitals in England. Scotland reported  new deaths as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there were fresh signs the lockdown was working, but also warned: “We are by no means through this yet.” Wales reported  more deaths and  were recorded in Northern Ireland. The death toll stood at , on Wednesday. Despite agreeing to this extension there are believed to be extensive ides inside the Cabinet, with Treasury ministers warning that the economic impact of an extended closure could create a nightmare scenario for the British economy. Earlier this week the Office for Budget Responsibility said that the economy could shrink by %the lockdown lasted three months. To aid the fightback the government is rapidly trying to expand its testing facilities - with a pledge to reach , tests a day by the end of the month. It is also developing a mobile app which could make contact tracing easier - but only% of smartphone users download it when it is available. But the government has missed its target to reach , coronavirus tests a day as more than half of capacity lies unfilled. A statement on March  said testing would be ramped up to , a day “within four weeks” - which came to an end yesterday. But as of am yesterday, , tests had been carried out in Britain in the previous  hours. At no point has the number topped ,. That is despite Downing Street saying today that total daily testing capacity is now over ,.

The scientic advice is clear. If we were to lt the restrictions now, we would risk undoing all the good work achieved so far. It is thanks to a collective national effort that the rate of infections has slowed and the NHS has been able to cope with the crisis. Another few weeks of social distancing is a price worth payingit saves lives. But it will also require more sacrices for many people. This will be especially tough for families in high-rise buildings or those in the high-risk category. Others will be worried about being separated from loved ones, or whether they will still have a job to go to when all this is over. The Government insists there is light at the end of the tunnel, yet has so far failed to spell out how we will emerge from isolation. The country has shown remarkable resilience so far. If ministers want that to continue they need to say what the exit strategy entails. Pressure is on Matt Hancock today snapped at journalists for daring to question the Government’s response to the crisis. The Health Secretary claimed the questions were beginning to irritate the public.  Butit were not for the media highlighting how care homes were hotbeds for the virus, ministers might not have taken action. Too few care workers were being tested, PPE was scarce and too many residents were dying. A free press will cheer governments when they get things right and hold them to account when they get things wrong. And that means asking hard questions of ministers who stand accused of having failed to protect the people they are there to serve.

Jamie Sparrow has appeared in court for breaching lockdown guidance after inviting a number of people to enjoy a barbecue and drink alcohol at his home in Kearsley, Bolton. Police were called to the house yesterday after a nurse who lived on the street reported the party, Manchester Evening News reports. A disturbance then broke out in the street after Sparrowaposs next-door neighbour Helen Bent directed a torrent of abuse at the woman who had complained.Bent, , and Sparrow, , were arrested and spent a night in the cells before appearing at Manchester Magistratesapos Court today.A judge was told police had been called to the party at the semi-detached property during the day. Despite a warning, the party continued late into the evening. When officers ed at pm, they found six people still inside the house - including a young child. Bent defied further orders to leave and, as other neighbours aired their concerns to officers in the street, the mother-of-three turned on the woman who had complained, calling her a aposfat f***ing s**gapos. She then stormed back inside the house and turned up the volume on the music while shouting apospartyapos.  Laura Keegan, prosecuting, said Sparrow, who works as a care worker at a childrenaposs home, then started behaving in an aposaggressive and argumentativeapos manner towards officers, who were forced to restrain him. The court heard the father-of-one did not aposseem to understand what social distancing isapos even when officers tried to explain it to him. Ms Keegan added: He told police he would do whatever he wants, when he wants. He said he was allowed to have a house party. Joseph Foxler, representing the pair in court, said Sparrow had consumed two glasses of rum, but was not a regular drinker. Bent had drunk eight cans of Carling in the build-up to the incident, but was said not to be drunk. The pair pleaded guilty to charges of a breach of peace and contravening a requirement as to restriction of movement.

Leaders from the industry said they were receiving only “paltry” and “haphazard” deliveries of lesaving items such as masks, gloves and gowns. It added that carers have been forced to go without such items while they have been mandatory for all healthcare workers. Meanwhile, NHS staff have taken part in protests to highlight the failings in PPE provision and are calling on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to resign. They launched a protest on social media yesterday, backed by campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, to coincide with the pm Clap for our Carers. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror Their campaign states: “As we see our colleagues die, we have lost confidence in the Government.”Mark Boothroyd, , an AE nurse at London’s St Thomas’s Hospital, where Boris Johnson was treated, said: “We’re all fed up with not having enough PPE or not good enough quality PPE, it’s putting us at risk. We feel we’re being lied to.”The explosive letter was sent to the Government by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and leaked to the BBC. It adds: “Testing for care workers appears to be being rolled out without being given thought to who is going to be tested and what we are going to do with the result.” It said the care sector, which looks after around , of Britain’s most vulnerable people, was being overlooked while officials focused on the NHS.  The letter said staff had been left confused and faced extra work because of mixed messages put out by officials. It also criticised the Government for recruiting , NHS volunteers and then giving them “nothing to do”. Care bosses believe these people were erted from volunteering with the elderly in their local communities.Shadow Care Minister Liz Kendall said: “The concerns raised in this letter are extremely worrying. Their view that the supply chain for PPE has been shambolic and that testing for care workers hasn’t been properly thought through must be an urgent wake-up callfor ministers. “ Coronavirus has exposed the already fragile state of these vital services. Ministers must heed the warnings from Adass and take all necessary action to halt the emerging crisis in social care.”Facing growing pressure to act, Mr Hancock on Wednesday promised measures to alleviate the dire situation in the nation’s , care homes. He vowed to raise the amount of personal protective kit given to homes and to offer testing to all residentsand staff with symptoms.Mr Hancock yesterday said he was confident only % homes – or one in six – had outbreaks. However, robust data from across Europe showed around half of care homes have Covid- cases. Care providers estimate up to two thirds of English care homes have outbreaks. Adass said it was “disappointed” that the letter was leaked publicly, but said the issues addressed “were already in the public domain and a cause of considerable concern”. President Julie Ogley said: “Some of the language used in the letter  may be more emotional than we would normally use, but we are in emotional times.  “We see continuing concerns about access to PPE, availability of testing, rising numbers of Covid-  cases  in care homes and people are sadly dying. “It is vital we prioritise people who are using social care, family carers and staff, whether in care homes or their own homes, to protect them. We are pleased the Government’s strategy is a positive response to many of the concerns that we have raised.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “The Government has set out a comprehensive action plan to support the adult social care sector in England throughout the coronavirus outbreak, including ramping up testing, overhauling the way PPE is being delivered to care homes, and helping to minimise the spread of the virus.

Harry admitted that he almost felt guilty about how much family time he was having with his -month-old son during the pandemic, saying youaposve got to celebrate these moments before youaposre called away with work. He gave the insight while chatting to two families who are supported by the WellChild charity, which helps seriously ill children across the UK. He spoke with them from his new LA home for about half an hour over the long Easter weekend, wearing a casual blue shirt and sitting in front of a cream wall and a dark wood cupboard. He said: There’s a hell of a lot of positives that are happening at the same time and being able to have family time — so much family time — that you almost think, ‘Do I feel guilty for having so much family time apos You’ve got to celebrate those moments where you are just on the floor rolling around in hysterics. Inevitably, half an hour later, maybe a day later, there’s going to be something that you have to deal with and there’s no way you can run away from it.  But he did admit that itaposs not all easy, adding jokingly: I canapost even begin to imagine how hard it is for you guys, having one kid at   months old is enough.During the chat, Harry called on the Government to give families like these the recognition they deserve as some struggle to get support during the  coronavirus  pandemic.WellChild, which the prince has been patron of since , has said some are finding it dficult to be classied as vulnerable as the crisis puts extra strain on their lives.  The two families Harry spoke to were both supported by the charity which helps seriously ill children - and during the call the prince urged those in Westminster to take action. He also spoke with a specially-trained nurse and the head of WellChild - while there were brief glimpses of his new home in the background. He said: Full respect to every single one of you. This is hard on everyone, but it is especially hard on you.  Hopefully, through this video we can make it more clear and obvious to government and everybody  that you are in the vulnerable bracket and WellChild needs more help. Many disabled children require complex medical care and often constant support but the lockdown has put enormous pressure on their parents. Not to mention the fear that their kids could contract the potentially killer bug.  Talking about the dficulties that families are facing WellChild CEO Colin Dyer said the people the charity supports are always isolated and hidden and lockdown is just adding to that. He said getting the authorities to notice their struggles is a huge uphill battle because the focus just doesnapost seem to be on families like this. Mr Dyer added that while PPE is in desperately short supply for front line workers, other basic supplies are needed, including food and cleaning products for the vulnerable.  Craig Hatch and his family were one of those Harry spoke to at the weekend. The dad, from Cumbria, cares for his son Fraser, , who has cerebral palsy, epilepsy, neuro muscular scoliosis, osteoporosis, chronic lung disorder and type  diabetes. Craig said the family is scared becausethe virus gets into the house and infects Fraser the implications are quite severe. The duke also chatted to Leanne Cooper, from Lincoln, mum to twin girls, , who both have complex needs.

He was, however, no priest but undercover police detective Leo­­nard “Nipper” Read about to finally take down the most feared gang in London’s history. While pretending to hear the con­­­fessions of a sinner, he instead took a secret statement from the Kray twins’ trusted right-hand man that would put them behind bars for the rest of their lives.  Nipper, widely regarded as the greatest policeman of post-war Britain, died last week at  – another victim of coronavirus.Author James Morton, who wrote Nipper Read: The Man Who Nicked the Krays with the legendary detective, says his friend had “a good and remarkable le”. “He did what no one  man­­aged – to put the Krays behind bars. He was honest and trustworthy at a time when a great many in the Met were not so honest. He was a thoroughly genuine, decent man. As a crime author, I’ve spoken to a lot of criminals who knew and respected him. “The we of one robber he helped convict told me he was the perfect gentleman in every way.”  Nipper shouldn’t actually have been allowed to join the police at all. Too small at ft in – hence his nickname – he failed the entrance criteria for the force in his home city of Nottingham. He was only accepted by the Met after convincing the medical examiner he was still growing, at the age of , and promising to perform daily “stretching” exercises. But his short stature proved invaluable. He admitted: “I was very small and very thin and didn’t look anything like a policeman”.  It came in useful many times as he went under cover and he was soon sent to CID. Early attempts to put Ronnie and Reggie behind bars ended in disaster as their violent reputation made witnesses afraid to testy. So Nipper’s new boss, Assistant Commissioner Peter Brodie, tasked him with bringing down the organised crime bosses once and for all. Nipper later remembered being astonished at the celebrity status of the Krays in London’s East End.  He said: “If they drove down Commercial Road every­­one waved. “If somebody had a drink with them, it was like having tea with Princess Margaret.” As an undercover officer, he first saw Ronnie Kray in  at the Grave Maurice pub in Whitechapel. He said: “There was a big American car and a guy stepped out with his hand in his pocket as though he had a gun there and sort of swept the street, making sure there was no one in sight. He gave a signal, the door opened and out stepped Ronnie.  “He was dressed like a s Chicago gangster with a cashmere coat that reached to his ankles tied with a loose belt at the waist. His hair was greased and parted and he wore glasses. “He looked like Al Capone without his fedora.” Convinced they were untouchable, the Krays’ gang The Firm were responsible for a string of gruesome murders in  and . In the first, Ronnie shot George Cornell in the head in front of locals in the Blind Beggar pub because he had referred to him as “a fat poof”. Another victim, Jack “the Hat” McVitie, was lured to a basement where he was held down in a chair as Reggie sliced his face with broken glass before stabbing him with a carving kne in the face and neck and twisting the kne. Nipper knew that,he wanted to catch the biggest fish of all, he would have to do things dferently, explains Mr Morton.  He says: “The Krays were getting away with it because their solicitor’s clerk knew certain people in the Met who they were paying off. “The story was thatyou went in to make a statement about the Krays, by the time you came out the brothers already had a copy.” Nipper began approaching fringe members of The Firm, persuading them to spill the beans in exchange for immunity. Knowing there were few officers he could trust, he revealed as little of his investigations as possible. Even so, the Krays got wind he was after them. They bought two boa constrictors and named them Read and Gerrard after Nipper and his partner Fred Gerrard.Eventually Nipper had enough to charge the Krays with fraudand grievous bodily harm and, in May , the twins, along with brother Charlie and their lieutenant Albert Donoghue, were dragged from their beds and arrested in a dawn raid. With the ringleaders behind bars, Nipper set to work persuading key witnesses, include the barmaid of the pub where George Cornell was shot dead and Leslie Payne, who had handled the Kray’s business affairs, to testy against them. Mr Morton says: “The barmaid was terried. So he played a long and patient game, taking her and her children to Lon­­­don airport to see the planes and slowly persuading her she did not need to be afraid.” But at Brix­­­ton prison, the Krays were planning to pin the mur­­ders on other gang members, inc­­luding Donoghue. But he got wind of it and sent a message, via his mother, that he wanted to speak to Nipper.  This was when the detective dressed as a vicar and met Donoghue in the jail chapel. Mr Morton says: “Donoghue said ‘I’ll tell you everything’. And he did. That was the moment the Krays’ empire came crashing down.” The following year the twins were sen­­tenced to le with a mini­­mum  years – the longest murder sen­­tences ever handed down at the Old Bailey. Ronnie died aged  in Broadmoor in  and Reggie in , eight weeks after being released on compassionate grounds. Nipper retired in , having received the Queen’s Police Medal the previous year, and became national security adviser to the National Museums and Galleries Commission.

Dr Goodall also added that .% of NHS Wales staff are off sick, compared to the usual % for this time of year. Five percent of staff are self-isolating, he said.  He said it was “inevitable”, adding that working in NHS means there will be a high level of risk. We have to accept Covid- is “indiscriminate” about who it affects, Dr Goodall said. But he added that we have to make sure we have guidance in place and supplies to support people. “We will see staff who have Covid- symptoms,” he said. He said “very stringent” infection control measures were in place to stop patients in hospital from contracting Covid-. Scenes of clapping seen at the Welsh hospital have been mirrored across the country as frontline workers celebrate patients winning their fight against the virus.  Earlier this month, NHS staff lined a corridor and clapped as an -year-old grandad was wheeled from hospital after recovering. His granddaughter filmed the heartwarming moment that her grandad prepared to leave hospital after he had been given the all clear, and uploaded it online. The unnamed man, who was sitting in a wheelchair had a mask over his mouth and nose, and was seen smiling and waving at the nurses who applauded him.

He was desperate as he watched his sobbing daughters say their final goodbyes to their mum who only had two hours to live, and asked the doctorhe he had heard of anything weird and wacky, any experimental treatment or something being used abroad in a desperate plea that I knew he couldn’t answer. However, the doctor did know of something - and it was a technique which has been used in ICUaposs for years, but not without risks in Staceyaposs case. Adam, a former news editor with the Times and now a PR consultant, wrote in his former paper how his two daughters, aged  and , had read Motheraposs Day cards to their dying mum on Sunday, March , hoping to say everything they wanted to say before their mum passed away. Adam later told Sky News this was heartbreaking. Mum-of-two Stacey was unconscious and on a le-support machine, in the intensive care unit of the Whipps Cross Hospital in East London, after her condition deteriorated two after having been admitted to hospital on March . Stacey, who has type  diabetes, was dying from the coronavirus and bacterial pneumonia while Adam said her kidneys and heart were not working properly. Adam and his two sobbing daughters donned full personal protective equipment including gloves, aprons and facemasks having been called to the hospital - which was on lockdown - to say their goodbyes. Adam told Sky News the PPE was so claustrophobic and he doesnapost know how the NHS hero medics wear it hour after hour. Writing in the Times, Adam said: A doctor had called and asked how quickly I could get to the hospital. When I arrived, he told me there was very little they could do for her and we should say goodbye. I remember askingthere was aposanything weird or wackyapos he had heard about, anything experimental that was working abroad. It was a desperate plea that I knew he couldn’t answer.  It was then that the doctor, who Adam said was called Dave, told him about proning, but warned it could place such pressure on her heart - that it could cause a fatal heart attack. Adam told BBC Radio aposs The World At One programme: Heexplained what proning was, where you turn the patient onto their stomach for about twelve, fteen hours and it promotes... it should promote oxygen flow, blood flow and improve the lungs. But he warned, because Staceyaposs heart wasnapost working properly and her heart and her kidneys, it would probably kill her - the pressure on her heart would be fatal. But I remember saying to him, look, well sheaposs going to die anyway and he said yes - so the three of us decided that there was nothing really to lose. We had to give it a shot. Adam told Sky News he discussed the risk with his two daughters and came to the only conclusion that there was nothing left to lose.  He said: Doctor Dave said stay, becauseanything goes wrong, it will go wrong really quickly. He came back after an hour and said she was still fighting, still surviving, go home and weaposll ring youanything bad happens. And that night the phone didnapost ring. They turned her again the next day for about  hours and the phone didnapost ring Monday night.

Jean in particular supported a lot of good causes, Cllr Smith said. When we were raising money to build what was then the new village hall, she was one of the major workers for fund-raising and stuff like that. When the church was extended, she was there again.  Sheaposd help any good cause and would always be there. Keith was always working in the background with her. They were a lovely family and it was tragic about Jayne as well - she worked for the police as a crime analyst at one point and then I think she went into nursing. Itaposs a tragedy. As a parish council, with permission from the family, weaposre going to do a tribute to them as I think they deserve it. Iaposve told the family to take their time and have a family conference about what theyaposd like to see and how theyaposd like to proceed. Iaposm hoping for a lasting tribute as people like that should never be forgotten. I was the town mayor between  and  and, unbeknown to me, Jean had held two coffee mornings for the mayoraposs funds. Itaposs a sad day when someoneaposs taken like that to this disease. The family has a lot of history in the village.Theyaposve done a lot of good in the village in their time. The couple, who had five children, sold their shop to St Modwen Homes after they retired to be used as part of a new housing estate. Another parish councillor, Pat Palmer, says she grew up with the family and has many fond memories of the newsagents they ran. Jean did a lot of fund-raising for a lot of people. Sheaposll be sadly missed - Iaposve known them all my le, she says. To hear their daughter has gone as well is unbelievable. We all grew up together and went to the same school, but as you get older, get married and move, out you lose track. I was shocked to find out about Jayne - itaposs very sad. To lose three members of one family, I canapost imagine it - itaposs heart-breaking. Iaposm  and theyaposve been around all my le.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAfter No announced an extension to the lockdown today, many were left with more questions than answers about when and how it might start to be eased. We asked two top experts for their insights into the way back to normality... How do we know when we have reached the peak  Prof Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “First, we are still testing many fewer people than in our European neighbours. Second, it seems to be very dficult to get timely data on deaths. “Once we have good quality data, we can ask whether the reproduction number – or R – has fallen below . If it has, we will know that every person who is infected is passing the infection on to fewer than one other person, which is absolutely crucial.” Dr John Ashton, former regional director of public health for the North West, believes we may actually still be some way off reaching the peak of the epidemic. He said: “All this talk about reaching the peak is based on the number of admissions and the number of deaths in hospitals, which seems to have levelled off, particularly in London. But that may be because fewer people are now being referred to hospitals as GPs are using clinical protocols to decide who will benefit from hospital treatment and who is too frail to be sent to hospital, and a lot of people are dying at home. In care homes too, we know there are a lot of deaths but we don’t know how many. How many days beyond the peak will lockdown start to be lted  Around two weeks after the reproduction number has fallen below , according to Prof McKee. But he cautioned: “Only when we are confident about the accuracy of the data can we begin thinking about loosening the lockdown. Also, this is absolutely dependent on having a robust system for testing and contact tracing in place.” How might the Government go about lting restrictions  Prof McKee said: “Firstly, we can ease the restrictions very gradually, for example, open only certain types of shops. The second thing is to put in place mechanisms to reduce spread, which will certainly include continued physical distancing.” Dr Ashton believes measures could first be eased off in parts of the country which have registered fewer cases. He said: “There don’t seem to be a lot of deaths in South West England, East Anglia and Lincolnshire and the main parts of Wales. “We could begin to relax restrictions in those places and adopt the same approach as we started with, testing, contract tracing and isolating those who test positive.”  But, again, he warned easing lockdown will only worktesting is massively ramped up. Could the schools be reopened soon  Denmark has relaxed restrictions on eduction, with children up to the age of  ing to nurseries and schools this week. But Dr Ashton is not convinced. He said: “Schoolkids are good at spreading viruses, so I don’t understand the talk about reopening schools.” Could younger workers who live alone be first back to work  Dr Ashton believes “creative solutions” must be found. He said: “I’ve been arguing that we should be billeting essential workers and volunteers away from anyone who is susceptible to the virus, and that might mean taking over hotels and boarding houses to allow them to live a normal le.”  Prof McKee, however, is sceptical of allowing some under a certain age toto work and prohibiting others. Which shops might be allowed to open first  Dr Ashton says: “If you want to stop people mixing then you don’t want places where people are sitting next to each other. However, you might want to open drinks and food retailers offering only takeaway or carry home services, but I still think that’s still some way off.” Could office and factory workers be tested before work  Prof McKee said: “The logistical challenges would be enormous, not least because it does take time to do the tests.”  Dr Ashton believes that regular testing such workers will be crucial. He says: “One option might be to test them all before they are allowed back, then screen their temperatures several times a day.” Aren’t other countries beginning toto normal  Prof McKee points out Spain is only moving to a position which is still more restrictive than in the UK. He adds: “In Italy, only a few shops, such as bookshops and those selling children’s clothing are being allowed to open in some regions.” Once the measures are lted, might they have to be reinstated   “Yes,” says Prof McKee. “Restrictions cannot be considered permanent until we have actually got this virus under control.” When will I be able to see my elderly relatives in a care home or self-isolating at home  Dr Ashton says: “It will be a long time before you will be able to see your relatives face to face, until we’re absolutely clear what’s going on. People will have to find ways to care for and love their relatives without being there in person, and make sure they can speak to them via videoconferencing.”  Prof McKee agrees, but warns: “We need to think very carefully about how we support those people who are confined.” Until a vaccine is developed, how might le remain dferent  Prof McKee said: “I think people will be very cautious about ing to anything like normality. This will have huge implications for how we live our lives, including the places we meet and shop, and for leisure, in particular where we go on holiday.” Dr Ashton says he doubts any of us will be able to go abroad for our summer holidays.

But for seven days, China withheld this information from the rest of the world as the pandemic spread like wildfire. The scienist behind the discovery, Shi Zhengli, was aposmuzzledapos from revealing her findings, which has prompted fears of a cover-up by the Chinese authorities. A virologist for  years, Zhengli is one of the worldaposs most renowned experts on coronaviruses. She has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves and after studying samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December she found it was similar to SARS.It was identied as a novel coronavirus and within three days she completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan, a process which can take monthsnot years.The claims are the latest to emerge after a cover-up by Chinese authorities who failed to share information or issue warnings early on and, ultimately, contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and more than a million confirmed infections.Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the   Mail on Sunday   reported.The journalist added: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. It is now being used around the globe in a race against time to find a cure and vaccine for the deadly bug, which has already infected close to million people around the world and caused , deaths. And after spending her working le examining coronaviruses in bat populations, which has earned her the nickname Bat Woman, Zhengli was one of the first to receive the call when a handful of patients presented with symptoms that looked to be a new strain of the bug. She was at a conference outside Wuhan but jumped straight on a train and back to her lab on December  last year. For two months, Zhengli and her team worked tirelessly to not only identy the genetic code but to learn all they could about Covid-. She lived entirely on packet noodles and only recently has her le ed to something resembling normality. But initially, Zhengli had one fear - her lab had been responsible for unleashing the virus on the world. In the  years she had been working with bats, Zhengli had found the subtropical areas of China posed the biggest risk for the coronavirus being transmitted from animals to human - not the centre of the country where Wuhan is located. She said: I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China. I remember thinking aposcould they have come from our lab apos Over the next few worrying days it emerged it did not seem to be a leak and the virus had likely had several previous, small, outbreaks before emerging in Wuhan at one of the cityaposs controversial wildle markets. Animals are sold, slaughtered and skinned, as customers browse the stalls in the markets, which have now been closed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. It would also seem there had been just one point where the virus had passed from animals to human and had then spread through human to human contact - until it covered the world. They sell a range of creatures, such as bats, civets, pangolins, badgers and crocodiles, although Zhengli and her team believe the virus came directly from the bats themselves. Almost two months after the first cases of the virus emerged in Wuhan, China permanently banned wildle consumption and trade. It is estimated this will forced million people out of work and cost the Chinese economy about £billion. And with so much experience working with the creatures, Zhengli believes the world needs to be on high alert for another coronavirus pandemic caused by bats. Her work started in the wake of SARS, which first emerged in  and killed thousands. Since  there have been no known cases of the virus. But it did start a global push to learn more about coronaviruses and Zhengli was part of the early teams who travelled to remote locations to study bats in caves. For months, work on the epedition was relentless with the team waking at dusk to work ovrnight when the bats had left the caves to hunt for food. They would collect blood, saliva and fecal swabs before grabbing a few hours sleep only tothe following morning to collect urine. For weeks there was no sign of coronavirus in the DNA that had been collected. Zhengli was heartbroken. She said: Eight months of hard work seemed to have gone down the drain. We thought coronaviruses probably did not like Chinese bats. It was as the team were about tohome that they were thrown a leline by another lab, who gave them a diagnostic kit for testing antibodies produced by people with SARS. Admitting she didnapost have high hopes it would work, Zhengli said she had nothing to lose by testing the samples and the results were incredible and was a turning project for the scheme. Antibodies against SARS were found in three species of horseshoe bats, which meant they were one step closer to finding the genetic code. After testing a huge number of sites, the team then narrowed their search down to the outskirts of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan and for the next five years they targeted their research on that area. One cave seem to be the SARS source and with the high volume of bats meant there was a risk new strains of a coronavirus could evolve from there. They also found that the virus could spread to those who werenapost directly handling the animals. People living in a nearby village had seen bats flying around. Six people had suffered from symptoms similar to SARS. And as humans increasingly encroach on areas that have previously been the domain of the natural world, Zhengli fears the risk of infections spreading also go up. This coupled with the movement of wildle and livestock around the world, along with increased long-haul travel, creates conditions perfect for the potential spread of a pandemic Last year Zhengli and her team published a study warning of the potential of a bat-borne pandemic. Little did they know just  months later their doomsday predictions would come true. Bats are believed to have responsible for six outbreaks of coronaviruses, including the Covid- pandemic, but experts insist problems only occur when people come into contact with the creatures themselves. Zhengli describes the Wuhan outbreak as a wake-up call for the world and work is now taking place around the globe to find a way to prevent another pandemic.

It was then that we decided to put our foot on the ball and pause.#We conveyed that decision to the centre and ceased taking calls on the subject.  We needed time to develop a clearer DFC view on the situation.#Whilst it is not our responsibility to take the lead on solutions for the league , it is our duty to attempt to ensure that the future of Scottish Football remains promising for all the clubs.#To that end, we have we have worked tirelessly to achieve solutions to help those who were being disadvantaged and sought ways to help them.#We have discussed options with a iety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal.  Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on more equitable footing.#Through our discussions it appears that there is an appetite to provide ious forms of support from other member clubsthese clubs are in fact relegated.  Further details of these acts of kindness and solidarity will be worked out amongst the member clubs.#Also, we are sorry to disappoint all of the conspiracy theorists by saying that we were never exposed to any ‘deals’ from either of the Glasgow giants.  They both acted, as we would expect, with complete professionalism.#Additionally and most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes does not give us much of a chance and this is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.#There are several things that have to be in place in order to deliver a proper opportunity of achieving a better foundation for Scottish Football’s future.  First, a working group should be assembled and must have members from the highest levels of Scottish Football with long-term interest in the future success of the game.#We need to agree a set of goals that will be the basis of reconstruction which takes into account current and future wants and needs of media member clubs’ financial benefits and sporting integrity as a basis.#It is our belief that after speaking to numerous clubs that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to set up an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.  The centre will have to accept and support the will of the members.#We do believe the centre has made mistakes in this process, namely not taking into consideration any financial fallout to their member clubs and publishing of the incomplete ballot results, which has put Dundee FC in a position to receive criticism and undue torment.#If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal.#We would like to thank the fans for their patience, and most of the member clubs for their cooperation and support during this time.  Make no mistake, we continue to have a daunting task ahead of us, but we are encouraged by everyday acts of kindness, resolution, and humanity that we are all sharing as we get through this together.  Stay safe and hope we see you soon in a newly revamped league.#lthr  gtltstronggt🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

Our view on that has not changed.#Over the past few days, we have entered into ious positive discussions with reconstruction at the forefront of these.#Given our discussions and considering all aspects, we don’t feel we are in a position to comment further on the resolution that was put forward.#We understand that this may bring more questions than answers and we will look to give a much more substantial account of the past few days at the conclusion of this process.#Our supporters should know that we are, as always, looking out for the best interests of both Dundee Football Club and Scottish football as a whole.#The Dens Park club issued the statement ahead of an expected SPFL board meeting later on this evening.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

","title":"football on the backburner for time being for aberdeen midfielder dylan mcgeouch","story":"AS MUCH as Dylan McGeouch would like to play out this season, it is a secondary thought for now for the Aberdeen midfielder.With the country in lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic the Dons ace has put thoughts of football restarting to one side.McGeouch’s greatest concern at this time is the safety of everyone across the country.Prior to last month’s shutdown the Reds had reached a Scottish Cup semi-final where they were due to face Celtic.Derek McInnes’ men were also just a point behind Motherwell in the battle to finish third in the Premiership.McGeouch would like to try to finish the campaign, but says right now it’s all about staying safe.The -year-old said: “There are a lot of questions and I think we’re keen to finish the league and Scottish Cup. Obviously we want to make sure we’re safe first and that there’s no risk taking.“Once we’re past that stage and the football is back on, that feels secondary now. It’s just about keeping people safe.”Scottish football remains in stalemate with Dundee stalling an SPFL resolution to end the Championship, League One and League Two seasons while also giving the league body’s board the power to declare the Premiership campaign over.Due to voting structure within each ision the Dens Park club hold the vote which can determine whether the motion succeeds or fails.But Dundee have dithered and other clubs are ready to continue their fight against the resolution, with the potential the row could rumble on for some time.McGeouch believes Scottish football’s administrators have an unenviable task trying to come up with a solution.The former Celtic, Hibs and Sunderland player added: “I’m just trying to keep myself fit and look after my family. As long as we are healthy, that’s the most important thing.“In the back of your head, you are obviously thinking ‘When will the season start ’ or ‘Is it over ’“But until we are at a stage when we can go out and socialise with people, the football is left to those running the game.“It’s up to them to come to a decision. No matter what the outcome is, it’s not going to please everyone.“But these are unprecedented times and it’s hard to know where things are going to go. We just need to keep fit, stay healthy and look after each other.“Then we will see where football goes in the next few weeks and months. It’s definitely not what I expected. Obviously it’s come as a huge shock to everybody.“Nobody could see it coming. It’s not good but we’re following the rules and hopefully we can keep ourselves safe, our families safe and in the next few weeks it blows over and we can get back to normality a bit.”With people only allowed out of their homes for an hour a day for exercise, restrictions have presented a challenge for professional footballers.But McGeouch says Aberdeen’s sports scientists have risen to the challenge of trying to keep players in good condition.The January signing from Sunderland said: “To be fair, the sports scientists have been great.“They’ve given us programmes to do in the morning to keep us ticking over fitness wise and they’re sending us yoga videos to do at home.“They’re just trying to mix it up. We’ve got our own equipment, balls and stuff. It’s not great but it’s the best of a bad situation to keep us ticking over.”For footballers, having to stay indoors most of the time, every day, has been something they have had to adapt to mentally.“We need to try to keep ourselves fit,” McGeouch added. “Mentally as well we need to keep ourselves fit, not sit about the house and keep ourselves active.“We’re used to that every day, really. To go to sitting about doing nothing, it’s hard.“Hopefully with the right fitness and stuff, we’ll be in good shape when the football starts back up.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience.

A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The documentrsquos most famous excerpt is a statement of Scottish independence.Mr Clark, who works at Hawick High School, has previously completed Scots translations of a number of popular books.The focus of his latest effort, however, was rather dferent in style to previous inspirations, which include Diary of a Wimpy Kid.It took Mr Clark and Ms Douglas around three months to convert the Declaration into our native language.Asked where his interest in Scots came from, Mr Clark said it was his move to the Borders  years ago which kick-started his love affair.ldquoI spoke Scots in Hamilton and so did my friends but I was under the impression it was just bad English ndash it was knocked out of you, said Mr Clark.ldquoBut then I came to the Borders and found that a lot of people not only spoke Scots, but spoke it without a social stigma.Reflecting on the Declaration, Mr Clark believes Scots have a strange relationship with the document.ldquoItrsquos funny that we have this text thatrsquos basically the birth certicate of the whole country, but therersquos not a lot of knowledge about it, said Mr Clark, going on to outline his views on its signicance.ldquoAt root, itrsquos a revolutionary document. Itrsquos a country asserting its right to be a country and its right to choose its own ruler.ldquoWe should be a lot more proud about Scotland being one of the first countries to assert itself in this way.Mr Clark says he supports Scottish independence, but he is keen for the Declaration to appeal to nationalists and unionists alike.He said: ldquoI think itrsquos really important the Declaration of Arbroath is not part of a political wrangle. People of every stripe in Scotland should see this as being part of the heritage."},{"url":null,"title":"300-borders-firms-receive-coronavirus-funding","story":"ALMOST pound million in coronavirus support funding has been paid out to businesses in the Borders.Scottish Borders Councilis managing a portion of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Coronavirus Business Support Fund.And it has been revealed that more than pound.m has been paid out so far, helping a total of  businesses.Last week the authority announced it had paid around pound.m to  businesses.SBC chief executive Tracey Logan said: ldquoSince our last update, in less than seven days wersquove managed to make payments to almost  businesses, with more payments to be processed throughout this week.ldquoWe absolutely appreciate how dficult a time this is for local businesses and how vital this funding could be.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water. As before, the flames fizzed for a moment but it made no dference.Just then a hare ran by and saw what the squirrel was doing.ldquoYou foolish animal, said the hare, ldquoyou canrsquot put the fire out by yourself.The squirrel looked at the hare and nodded.ldquoI know she said, ldquobut the forest is my home so Irsquom doing what I can do.Then she asked the hare, ldquoWill you help me The hare thought for a moment. He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears.

The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

We all have habits that we perform every single day, we make cups of tea, we brush our teeth, we have a glass of water. What I want to show you is a way we can take advantage of these current habits, to make new habits. So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise. We all find it dficult doing something new, so donrsquot beat yourself up about it and more importantly donrsquot give up in frustration.Dficulty gives an opportunity to improve.In each of the videorsquos wersquoll give you some pointers to help improve your form. We need feedback in order to make adjustments to improve this form. We can do this using body awareness like I mentioned earlier but it can also be useful to video ourselves doing these exercises, to seewe can spot any issues.So there you have it, three things to keep in mind when doing these exercises:Use old habits to create new habits these exercises are an opportunity to practice movement form takes time and practice to develop.* Shops across Scotland are closing.

The internet means access to sophisticated online archives is only a mouse click away and there are scores of websites offering advice to those hoping to discover their inner Sherlock Holmes.It all makes genealogy ndash and historical research more generally ndash ideal for locked-down Scots seeking mental stimulation at home.The premises of institutions such as the National Library and National Records of Scotland might be shut but thatrsquos no barrier when information can be obtained instantly and from anywhere. Even more importantly, much of it is free.Researching your family treeThere has over the last two decades been an explosion in the range and richness of online content available to those looking to find out more about their ancestors. Public interest in family history has grown just as rapidly.The ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh , part of the National Records of Scotland, provides online access to births, marriages and deaths, as well as wills, census documents, Coats of Arms and valuation rolls.Fees are charged for viewing some items but, explains Iain Ferguson, Centre Manager, the entire operation has been designed to maximise speed and ease of use.ldquoInstead of the olden days when you had to come in, we now have digitised museum records, he says. ldquoYou just type in a name and year, and the system can search for it in an instant. And you have the opportunity to look up images of records.Of course, the online quest to trace a family tree doesnrsquot have to be limited to big national organisations.Independent websites can also offer a vital helping hand. FindMyPast , one of the largest and best known, gives armchair genealogists access to billions of records and its archive is expanding all the time. Late last year, it announced a new online collection spanning nearly five centuries of Dundee and Angus history. The materials provide names, dates, residences and occupations, as well as photographic documents of streets and people. Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away. And video chat apps mean the coronavirus lockdown is no obstacle to enjoying quality, face-to-face contact.ldquoTalking to your family is hugely important, says Tahitia McCabe, Genealogical Studies Postgraduate Programme Course Director at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoItrsquos the way you get the juicy bits - the stories and all the interesting stuff. Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country. Lucy Church, NLS reference services assistant, says such resources are vital for adding a social dimension to the raw information set out in documents such as birth, marriage and death certicates.ldquoPeople use [our collection] to find out about specic iniduals but what itrsquos best for is the bigger picture ndash social and local history, for example, she adds.ldquoWhat we have available has vastly increased in recent years. Since the internet has been available, the archiving world has really engaged with it - and how we can provide a service through it.Stressing that staff are always on hand to assist home users in dficulty, she says: ldquoIf you think of institutions like ourselves, the National Museum of Scotland, National Records ndash they all have really excellent websites. The best way [for people] to familiarise themselves with the collection is to have a look and just be guided by what their particular interest is.Parents in particular will find Scotlandrsquos major cultural institutions invaluable when theyre trying to keep children busy. The NLS website features a wide-ranging learning zone with materials about topics such as the womenrsquos suffrage movement.The Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, meanwhile, has created dedicated online resourceswhich its leaders hope will inspire youngsters to create prose, poetry and art about Bonnie Prince Charliersquos famous victory in  over a government army led by Sir John Cope. Entries will be published online and organisers hope to include as many as possible in a special commemorative book to mark the battlersquos th anniversary.Also offering online home schooling assistance is the National Wallace Monument, which has launched a video series to help young people learn about William Wallace and the Wars of Scottish Independence. Available at www.nationalwallacemonument, it is aimed at children aged between  and  who are encouraged to watch the videos and answer questions based on the content.Catherine Morrison, Learning and Volunteer Co-ordinator at Stirling District Tourism, says: ldquoUsually, Irsquom hosting trips for school children at the Monument, or visiting schools to teach them all about William Wallace. These are things wersquore not currently able to do, but we wanted to do something to support parents and keep their children learning about history.Sidebar ndash top tips for the budding genealogist Start with what you know. Begin by writing down everything you know about your family ndash names, dates of birth, places of residence. Evenall you have are rough dates and more questions than answers, itrsquos a place to launch your project. Talk to your family ndash do this sooner rather than later. If elderly relatives have all passed away, try older siblings or cousins. Search official records. Generally, yoursquoll want to try and obtain birth, marriage and death information for your ancestors and anyone  on your tree that is of interest. Plus, finding them on available census records is of primary importance. Itrsquos best to start as close to the present as possible and work your way back. That way you can usually very facts with your memories and records, or by checking with other family members. Once you have built up your skills, keep going! You could get involved in new projects such as a transcription or indexing project in your spare time. This is a great way to expand skills in deciphering old handwriting.

Simple language, delivered calmly and directly, has the best chance of sinking in.Honesty, clarity, calmness and directness have never been more vital than now, as we try to take in the enormity of the coronavirus crisis and its consequences. And yet many of our leaders are showing themselves to be woefully, shamefully, sometimes even deliberately incapable of giving straight answers to some of the most fundamental questions.The public accepts that scientists and medics do not yet understand every facet and quirk of this virus. But there is simply no excuse for the disgraceful lack of honestly and clarity around many issues that politicians can control.If ever there was a time for politicians be direct with people, this is it. We do not want obsequiousness, we do not need the pill to be sugar-coated. Donrsquot patronise or insult us. Just tell it like it is, even when itrsquos bad. Especially when itsbad.

After all, there is still no reliable death toll, no UK or Scottish stats that include care home and community deaths as well as those that took place in hospital. Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on. It cannot be unrelated that no minister or official dares to explain why the death toll in the UK is on course to surpass that of Italy and Spain, despite having had more time to prepare. People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable. And thatrsquos how you end up with the likes of Home Secretary Priti Patel, the coldest fish this side of Greenland, issuing a textbook  apology ndash ldquoIrsquom sorryYOU feel there are failings ndash at a recent daily briefing. This chastising tone is an insult to us all, not least the dead and bereaved.Indeed, the defensive insults are starting to stack up. Over the weekend Ms Patelrsquos cabinet colleague Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, made the contemptuous suggestion that the continuing shortage of personal protective equipment at the frontline could be down to doctors and nurses over-using it.And while some sections of the media choose to focus unhealthy amounts of attention on one particularly well-known Covid- patient, offering a running commentary on his recovery complete with sudoku, texts from his girlfriend and the films he is watching from his hospital bed, it is left to others to highlight the far bigger tragedies already emerging from this crisis.As Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis pointed out in a blistering attack on the patronising and ldquomisleading language being used by some ministers during the crisis, we are not all in this together.

That the arrogance of this post-imperial country, with its delusions of Global Britain, led the UK elite to ignore the threat of Covid- until it was too late.Many Scottish nationalists feel much the same and say that Scotland has been harnessed to inept policies fashioned by a grossly incompetent Tory clique in Westminster.If only we could have closed the border with England, they sigh, looking at the way Jacinda Ardern has handled things in New Zealand, where the disease appears to have been stamped out by a total lockdown. At least for now.Reports that English firms had been declining requests from Scottish care homes for protective gear only confirm the suspicion that Scotland is a low priority, at the back of the queue, an afterthought.The SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil is by no means alone in believing that Scotland would be better ldquodealing with [our] own problems unfettered..[like]Norway, Ireland. Many MSPs are saying so privately, and wondering why Nicola Sturgeon is not distancing herself from the ldquolaissez faire approach of the English Tories.It was certainly possible that Scotland could have taken a dferent path to the rest of the UK. Smaller countries like Iceland and Singapore moved faster in locking down against Covid . Ireland closed the schools earlier than we did and seems to have been much better at suppressing the disease. Certainly the crude death rate has been around half the UKrsquos.But there is a problem: throughout this crisis there has been no signicant dference between Ms Sturgeonrsquos approach to coronavirus and that of the other three nations in the four-nation pandemic alliance. SNP MPs may say that the Scottish Government was press-ganged into backing the UK approach to handling Covid- and that her instinct was to go for a much tougher lock down earlier. However, there is no basis for thinking this.When Leo Varadkar made his dramatic announcement on March  closing the schools in Ireland, the First Ministerrsquos response was that this was unnecessary. She said she agreed with her own medical advisers that the disease would likely be spread just as readily by children at home, and that the emergency services would be undermined by parents having to stay at home to look after their kids.As for testing, this was actually stopped by the Scottish Government in mid March. As the National Clinical Director, Professor Jason Leitch, told Channel  on March , ldquocommunity testing and contact-tracing was halted after the containment phase. The First Minister was fully aware of this. On April , standing next to Ms Sturgeon, the then Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said that testing was ldquoa distraction. This seemed to be a general view among UK medical advisers.Ms Sturgeon has said that she ldquofollowed the science. This has been the mantra used by ministers like the UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, since this outbreak began. Many commentators regard this as a convenient excuse for incompetence. ldquoWhy didnrsquot they listen to dferent scientists and the World Health Organisation who were advising countries to test, test, test But Britain has some of the best epidemiologists in the world sitting on the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies. The UK Chief Scientic Adviser, Professor Patrick Vallance, said again yesterday that ldquoI donrsquot think it is quite right that testing saves lives. Our medics still believe that tests should be confined to people who have symptoms and to essential workers. Mass testing will only make sense in their view when there is a reliable antibody test ndash and there isnrsquot one.Yet, testing and contact-tracing seems to have worked where, not just in South Korea, but in Germany where the death rate has been signicantly lower. Critics like Professor Devi Sridhar, Chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University, insist that the Scottish Government could and should have embarked on mass testing, though itrsquos not clear how it could have found the capacity so to do.She also claims that Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon adopted a ldquoherd immunity strategy because of ldquoBritish exceptionalism. Herd immunity has morphed into an ideological battle-ground, rather than an epidemiological truism.The problem for politicians like Ms Sturgeon is that they are expected to base their policy on ldquothe science, listen to the ldquoexperts, and make policy ldquoevidence based. But as soon as they do so, they are liable to be accused of listening to the wrong kind of scientists.Epidemiologists take a long view about the progress of a disease through its le-cycle involving several peaks and troughs. They have said from the start that since there is no vaccine,  per cent of us are going to get the disease anyway so there is no way of stopping it. That was one of the first remarks Ms Sturgeon made about Covid-.It is what the top UK advisers, like Professor Vallance meant when they were talking about herd immunity. In the absence of a vaccine, they believed that the only way the disease would die out would be when most of us were exposed to it. Prof Leitch was adamant on March  that : ldquothe alternative ndash closing the borders and locking everyone down ndash doesnrsquot work over a prolonged period.Thatrsquos as may be, but it now looks asthe politically savvy thing to have done was to ignore all this and go for a panic lockdown to show the voters that you are serious. In politics, doing something is always more appealing than not doing something.Scientists donrsquot have to answer to Twitter. The political cycle is not on the same trajectory as this disease, and politicians will get no credit for being right in a couple of yearsrsquo time.Shops across Scotland are closing.

Yet beyond the basic and inarguable provisions for making decent meals and keeping the household clean, where exactly is the line that distinguishes justiable consumption from self-indulgence  And who is in a position to judge one from the other  On a scale of one to , for instance, how do ice-cream or pimento-stuffed olives score  Are beef burgers or pizzas the wisest way to eat, or could a police officer confiscate these and insist we replace them with broccoli and wild salmon Most worrying of all, for me at least, is whether we should be abstaining from olive oil, the ingredient without which no dinner in our house is considered complete, and replacing it with a local equivalent, thereby avoiding air miles, and supporting our own economy  If so, what would that stand-in be ndash dripping or lard While the police thankfully did a U-turn on its threat to put our shopping under surveillance, it will have made some of us considerably more self-conscious as we feed our goods onto the conveyor belt. I never normally give it a thought, but now Irsquoll be worrying what antisocial habits my trolley reveals.Doubtless the contents of most baskets would not cause an officer to pause for a nanosecond, unless they included a box of party invitations and enough barbecue coals to fuel a power station. But now the issue has been raised, it makes you re-evaluate every purchase.After rummaging through my wardrobe, I can probably get through to the end of the year without buying anything  other than plimsolls. By December I might be looking a little shabby, but thatrsquos hardly news. And, since mending and making do is enjoying a comeback, others will presumably be in much the same state.If nothing , this enforced stasis offers the space to reflect on how often what we buy is surplus to requirement. Compost bins and landfill must be groaning under the weight of food whose sell by date, like one of Douglas Adamsrsquos deadlines, whooshed by ages ago. Last week a neighbour discovered self-raising flour among her long-lost ingredients at the back of the cupboard and, after checking for weevils, enjoyed a baking spree with some equally ancient dried yeast. Going through his chest of drawers, my husband came upon a lovely unworn jumper of mine that is at least a decade old, but looks brand new. That I hadnrsquot noticed its absence speaks for itself.What previously felt like must-haves now simply suggest a reflex. The act of repeatedly reaching out and purchasing says more about a magpie urge to acquire than any critical shortage. This is not a puritanical call to give up the worldly or frivolous or, when the good times , to eschew the pleasures of things that, strictly speaking, we could get by without. Tens of thousands of businesses, artists and companies would be bankruptedwe adopted an ascetic lestyle that pared everything to the bone. In fact, when finally we unlock, we will actively need to help cash-strapped outfits and iniduals get back on their feet.As Europe takes its initial tentative steps towards easing restrictions, the notion of what is indispensable to daily existence moves beyond the hypothetical to something more profound. In some parts of Italy, bookshops, stationers and stores selling childrenrsquos and baby clothes are now being allowed to open, under strict conditions. In Austria, meanwhile, garden centres and hardware shops are back in business.These highly specic priorities are revealing of each nationrsquos personality. And while some would refute the idea that books or plants are anything other than accessories, Irsquod go to the barricades to defend both as central to survival. After sustenance and medication, we need a reason to exist beyond merely ticking over. The proleration of good bookshops in Italy shows its reverence for literature, a cultural bias that is confirmed by this decision. Perhaps the authorities recognise that, while enforced incarceration is likely to continue for some time, people must be allowed to feed their minds and imaginations as well as their stomachs.The same goes for gardening, which is a universal expression of the desire to nurture and grow. Such is the over-abundance of stock in garden centres and nurseries right now, getting the tills ringing makes economic sense as well as offering a glimmer of light at the end of the polytunnel.Shops across Scotland are closing.

But the threat from the virus remains, so what lessons can we learn from other countriesrsquo exits In Europe, most countries are lting restrictions very gradually. In Denmark, nursery and primary schools have reopened, the Czech Republic allowed some ldquonon-essential shops to reopen, and Austria said small shops, garden centres and DIY stores could resume trading this week with plans to reopen cafes and restaurants in mid-May ndash though schools remain closed indefinitely.None of the three have re-opened their borders to foreign visitors, and Austrian leaders have implied that any leisure travel outside of Austria may be banned until a vaccine is available.This sort of gradual approach ndash lting some restrictions but not all, while giving citizens enough hope of a normal le to persuade them to hold out a bit longer ndash seems like a scenario that will soon play out here.The World Health Organisation stated this week: ldquoTo reduce the risk of new outbreaks, measures should be lted in a phased, step-wise manner based on an assessment of the epidemiological risks and socioeconomic benefits of lting restrictions on dferent workplaces, educational institutions, and social activities...Testing will play an important role in helping to ease the UK out of lockdown. When the epidemic first began escalating, our capacity to test en masse was woefully inadequate.As a result, when evidence of community transmission emerged, efforts to contain the virus ndash through testing, contact tracing and isolating infected iniduals and anyone they might have exposed ndash were abandoned.: Hospital admissions slowing and half of intensive care beds lie emptyIn contrast, countries like South Korea, whose experience of another coronavirus, MERS, had put it on an epidemic war footing, was ready at the outset to test thousands a day and provide results within hours. They used location data from mobile phones, credit-card transaction records and CCTV footage to identy, noty and test people who might have crossed paths with an infected person.Combined with hand-washing, and social distancing measures such as closing schools, museums, gyms and discouraging public transport use, it has so far limited its Covid- mortality rate to four per million, compared to  per million in the UK.Scotland aims to have a capacity to process , tests a day by the end of April, by which time pressure to start exiting will be escalating.Other tools such as a contact-tracing app are in the pipeline. The technology, produced by the UK Government, Apple and Google, will let people self-report Covid symptoms, then alert possible contacts.Much-touted antibody blood tests have so far proved too unreliable for use on the NHS, althoughand when a breakthrough comes so-called lsquoimmunity passportsrsquo could be a route out back to normality for some. However, there are reports of some people acquiring the infection a second time, which,true, would muddy the waters somewhat.: Poverty, lockdown or missed Covid cases - whats behind Scotlands mystery surge in deathsIn Scotland, lower incidence of the virus per head compared to where in the UK suggests we probably also have slightly lower herd immunity, especially in rural areas.This could make us more vulnerable to a second wave, but this risk could again be mitigated through testing, contact tracing, quarantining, and adherence to voluntary social distancing .Finally, going it alone and breaking Scotland out of lockdown first raises questions about whether, and how, we would police the border with England. This would no doubt be a political headache as much as a public health one.Nicola Sturgeon urges caution in interpreting declining hospital and ICU admissions, but is she really just buying herself time for the dficult decisions ahead Shops across Scotland are closing.

However it would need to be well managed.\"The Outer Hebrides hasjust six confirmed cases of Covid- - and isthe only health board without a death from the virus - while Orkney had five cases and recorded its first death on Friday of a -year-old grandmother with underlying health problems.Professor Pennington said: \"There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions - such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.\"The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.\"As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected .He added: \"The key is to get testing up in those islands becauseanybody showed signs of having the virus they could be quickly tested and aggressive contact tracing implemented. That is the eventual way out of this.:Coronavirus: Death rate from Covid in England is nearly twice as high as Scotland\"The islands have good medical facilities, but you would need to have good and effective testing facilities in place with a quick result. It would not cost a lot of money. ldquoIt would be an example for the rest of the country as long as there was an early warning system in place. It could then be possible for the Highlands and Grampian to follow.\"Hotspots will not last because people will either recover or sadly die. So we have to think of how we are going to get out of this.\"Overall cases need to come down substantially - by about ten times - for the lockdown to be lted throughout the country. That is why we need test beds where levels are already low.\"The virus has been spreading under the radar into places like care homes, presumably by workers who were unaware they were infected. The testing needs ramping up. The best you can say overall is that itis not now out of control, but we do not yet have control over it.\":Coronavirus in Scotland: Nicola Sturgeon to share thinking on lockdown exit in coming daysProf Pennington, who has been appointed by the Scottish Police Federation as a coronavirus advisor, said that government health planners needed to take into account that a vaccine will not eradicate the virus.He said: \"We have had flu vaccines for  years and flu is still a pandemic threat and kills large numbers each year.\"It is still the worst of all vaccines because it only works for some and not everybody. I would not be surpriseda corornavirus vaccine did the same. It will reduce the number of deaths, but not give complete protection or eradicate the virus.\"My hope is that Covid- behaves like its relative SARS and disappearthe right measures are taken. Then you will not need a vaccine but have it in reserve. \"But people should not be seeing a vaccine as a panacea. It reduces the risk and planners need to take that into account in their planning. They have not tested the vaccine enough to know how effective it will be.\"A second wave of this virus is possible, but I think unlikely in the foreseeable future. It didnt happen with SARS, its relative. There were three waves of the  flu pandemic, but this is not flu.\"The scientist worked at St Thomas Hospital, London, with the renowned virologist who discovered the first human coronavirus - Glasgow born June Almeida.Proffesor Pennington headed the investigation into the Ecoli outbreak in Wishaw in Scotland which claimed the lives of  elderly people in .He chaired a  enquiry into a Welsh E. coli outbreak.Former Labour Minister, Brian Wilson, who chairs one of the islandss biggest employers, Harris Tweed Hebrides, said: \"This is a really interesting, constructive suggestion and I just wish Professor Pennington was closer to decision-making in Scotland.\"We have a micro-economy here with very little coming and going at present. With careful monitoring and testing, it makes a great deal of sense to gradually re-open the economy and then roll out the lessons learned where. At some point, there has to be a movement and where better to start than with islands \""},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-campaign-create-picture-scotland-lockdown","story":"National tourism body, Visit Scotland, is harnessing the unique views from Scottish windows to illustrate le during the lockdown.The images, whether they are mundane or inspiring, will help form a new social media campaign which will map where the snapshots have been taken from.In a bid to suppress the spread of coronavirus across Scotland, people are being told to stay at home unless they are buying essential food and medicine, undertaking work which cannot be completed at home and one outdoors exercise session a day.As people across the country stay at home, Visit Scotland is urging residents to share the sights they can see from their properties - in a bid to create a virtual vision of Scotlands towns, villages and cities.The project hopes to create a reminder of what is waiting across Scotland when travel restrictions and social distancing measures are lted by authorities, when safe to do so.The project has been launched amid fears the lockdown, brought on by the pandemic, is having a huge detrimental impact on Scotlands tourism industry.Spending by tourists in Scotland generates around pound billion every year including the wider supply chains that support it. The industry contributes around pound billion to Scottish GDP, making up around % of it.The Fraser of Allander Institute has forecast that up Scotlands GDP could shrink by up to % as a result of the pandemic,restrictions stay in place for a three-month period.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Nicola Sturgeon to share thinking on lockdown exit in coming daysThe summer tourist season was dealt a major blow with the inevitable cancellation of Edinburghs five major festivals.Twitter users are being asked to take a picture of a view from their property and post it on social media using the hashtag #AWindowOnScotland and their location such as #Stirling, #Aberdeen or #Glasgow. Tourism leaders hope the campaign will remind visitors, particularly those who go on holiday at Scottish locations and represent one of the countrys most important tourism markets - of the erse landscape, vibrant cities and stunning scenery that is waiting for them when the isolation ends.Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of Visit Scotland, said: \"At the moment it is important we stay at home but while we cant get out, we saw an opportunity to create something that will remind people of what Scotland has to offer when this is over. \"When people are apart and feeling isolated, it is more important than ever to bring them together in an act of solidarity to show the warm, welcoming and friendly spirit of Scotlands people.\"He added: \"A Window On Scotland will spread the love of our home towns, villages and cities from across Scotland to our friends, neighbours and visitors and expand the window for the world during this challenging time. \"We hope this campaign will also offer tourism businesses an outlet to showcase their own views of Scotland and inspire visitors to see them for themselves when they can in the future.\"Visit Scotlands campaign will carry a very clear and responsible \"stay at home\" message - but will allow everyone to show off their corner of Scotland to the world.The tourism industry is facing its toughest-ever challenge at the moment, as the Covid- pandemic continues to cause national and international travel restrictions.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Warning economy could shrink by %Visit Scotland says it is working in partnership with the Scottish Government and other key authorities to manage any developments as effectively as possible.The Building Centre, a London-based hub for the built environment, dating back to , is attempting to map the shutdowns of the worlds cities, towns and villages.The organisation is aiming to create a national archive of images of empty buildings and streets and is inviting both amateurs and professionals to record their own neighbourhoods during this lockdown period.:Scottish companies shed more jobs than anywhere  in UKThe Building Centre is stressing that the images must be produced within social distancing and travel restriction guidelines - but believes many living in the centre of towns and cities will be able to take photographs safely from their homes.A spokesperson for The Building Centre said: \"While hoping that this will never ever happen again, some creativity might come into our daily lives through capturing this new landscape.\"We would like anyone with access to a smart phone or digital camera to record their own streets and buildings during this lock-down period.\"Obviously this must be within the guidelines set out by the government of limiting our trips out for essential shopping or exercise, but many people living in the heart of towns and cities will be able to take striking photographs out of their windows.\"The Building Centre hopes to document an archive of the photographic material and launch a major exhibition at its London gallery, once it re-opens to the public, following the lockdown."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-cliff-hanley-classic","story":"A DIARY tale about a mouthy maw reminds Bill Lindsay from Erskine of a story told by that legendary man of letters, Clf Hanley.

Itrsquos not war thatrsquos broken out, itrsquos peace.To some extent, but only to some extent, something similar has been happening in politics. You may have noticed last week that I suggested a Clap for Nicola might be appropriate in recognition of the way the First Minister has handled the crisis and I stand by the thought. Ms Sturgeon has cooperated with the other governments as part of a UK-wide response and we should particularly applaud her comment that, in times like this, the issues that ide us are less important.The accusation was startling: protective equipment for carers was not being supplied equally across the UK and was being withheld from Scotland. Donald Macaskill, head of Scottish Care, which represents private care homes, said the UKrsquos largest suppliers of PPE were simply not sending to Scotland and were prioritising Englandrsquos NHS and English social care providers.But could it be true  On the face of it, it was a contradiction of the idea that the UK was working on a UK-wide response and the First Minister said she was concerned about the claims. But fairly quickly Scottish Government sources said it wasnrsquot true Ms Sturgeon also said on Wednesday she accepted assurances from the UK Government that NHS England had not demanded PPE suppliers give preference to England.Itrsquos possible there may still have been some kind of misunderstanding with the suppliers, andso it needs sorted, but the furore is revealing. This has been a weird time for the angriest proponents of independence whose strategy has been to disagree with Westminster at all times. But suddenly they find themselves in a situation that demands cooperation and, dare I say it, political maturity and they canrsquot hack it. The First Minister, to her credit, can, and is acting in the national interest.The problem turns on how some nationalists respond to a crisis, or indeed pretty much anything. When coronavirus first started to bite, Donald Trump called it the ldquoChinese virus. This week he also said he was cutting US funding for the World Health Organisation on the basis that it has been biased towards China. Itrsquos how this brand of nationalism works: nationality first, other stuff second.There are many Scottish nationalists who think the same way ndash Scotland first ndash and they mean ldquoScotland first even in a crisis that transcends national boundaries. On PPE, they object to the idea that England might prioritise the English health and care system but flipped the other way they would not object to Scotland prioritising the Scottish health system. In fact, this is what they want. Scotland first.The fact the First Minister hasnrsquot used any of this kind of language during the crisis reflects well on her as a leader just as some nationalists are demeaned by the fact that they have kept on about Scotland versus England. All of it has also underlined the ision thatrsquos been growing between this Scotland First group of nationalists and their leader.What this particular group keeps asking is: why hasnrsquot she pushed harder for another referendum  Now theyrsquore asking: why isnrsquot she going it alone on coronavirus  And they may already be asking: is she really one of us  Ms Sturgeonrsquos reputation as a national leader may have grown as a result of this crisis, but her problems as leader of the SNP and the Yes movement have deepened.Shops across Scotland are closing.

raising it again to , and then ,.The First Minister said today it was now , based on clinical assessments.In England, the UK Government told supermarkets directly about its list of those at extra risk of coronavirus, including transplant recipients, cancer patients, and those with suppressed immune systems.However in Scotland the SNP Government asked the people concerned to register with a text service that was meant to pass their details to supermarkets as priority customers.Mr Carlaw said there had been hold-upswith the service, and asked how many people had had their details passed on, and how many of those had received deliveries.The First Minister admitted there had been ldquoproblems with some mobile phone providers last week, but said these had now been resolved.She said: ldquoWe now have , people who have registered through that SMS service, , free food packages have been ordered. Many of them have been delivered already.ldquoI have had contacts from people saying theyrsquove got them and theyrsquore very grateful for them.ldquoTwenty-one thousand people have requested that we pass their details on to supermarkets, so that supermarkets can prioritise them for deliveries, and their details have been shared with supermarkets. So that is all happening.ldquoWith any system like this that is put in place quickly for good reason and is complex and large scale, there will be glitches and there will be iniduals who have dficulties.ldquoBut the system is working and the numbers Irsquove given today I think evidence that.Askedshe was now certain every vulnerable person was getting the help they needed, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoWe are certain that everybody whorsquos been identied by the clinical process - I donrsquot decide who is in the vulnerable shielded group, Irsquom not a clinician - we originally said that would be up to ,, we then thought that would be ,, through further checks and making sure everyone is captured that figure is ,.All of those people have been notied.ldquoIn a situation like this we will get inidual cases where further investigation is needed, and there is an absolute guarantee to address that as soon as possible.ldquoI donrsquot think itrsquos true to suggest there are growing numbers of people for whom these systems are not working. We are making these systems work.ldquoWe will continue to resolve the inidual cases, however many of them they continue to be, to make sure these are fixed as quickly as possible.Mr Carlaw said afterwards that SNP ministers had ldquodithered and chosen a more complex approach than the UK Government.He said: ldquoWe are now weeks into this public health crisis, yet still the SNP hasnrsquot managed to ensure vulnerable people can get supermarket delivery slots.ldquoThe UK Government simply passed its list on to the big chains, which allowed them to prioritise delivery slots for those who needed them most.ldquoBut here, the SNP dithered and eventually came up with a convoluted system, which hasnrsquot worked properly, and resulted in a pitul number of shielded people receiving the help they need.ldquoItrsquos just another example of the SNP doing something dferently for the sake of being dferent ndash and the consequences for the most vulnerable people have been serious.ldquoThe SNP government doesnrsquot even seem to know how many people are on its shielded list, with the number changing radically each time a minister talks about it.Ms Sturgeon later took to Twitter to insist that the supermarket service for the shielded group was a \"voluntary opt-in service\", and it was wrongto say not allpeople had \"been registered\" for it.lsquoBeen registeredrsquo is not right way to describe it. Itrsquos a voluntary opt in service - anyone on shielded list can choose to register and , have so far done so. They can then opt for delivery of free food box and or ask us to pass details to supermarkets - which we do. https:t.co BoLqBTcDMr Carlaw added: \"Itrsquos very clear from all the initial Scottish Government correspondence, and indeed from direct statements by Nicola Sturgeon, that this was not merely an lsquoopt-inrsquo situation.ldquoFollowing her post-FMQ comments, Nicola Sturgeon appears to be questioning her own guidance in the face of the disappointing record of her own government in its support for key vulnerable people."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-snp-mp-criticised-tasteless-twitter-post","story":"Douglas Chapman questioned whether Scotlands \"vastly superior AE performance\" or its \"unique coronavirus assessment centres\" were the reason for its lower death rate.TheDunfermline and West Fe MP wrote on Twitter: \"Recorded deaths from #Covid in England are double the rate of what they are in Scotland.\"Itrsquos reasonable to ask WHY  Is it NHS Scotlandrsquos vastly superior AE performance OR is it Scotlandrsquos  unique coronavirus assessment centres keeping infected patients away from GP surgeries \"Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie called on Mr Champman to withdraw the comment.He said: \"Douglas Chapmans dubious analysis of Covid- death rates is tasteless.\"It is certainly not in the spirit of partnership with the rest of the UK that the First Minister has adopted. \"I am sure she will be embarrassed and uneasy that one of her Members of Parliament has acted in this way.\"The families who have lost loved ones and the health care workers risking their lives everyday on the front line want all our politicians to work together to help them through this crisis.\"Douglas Chapman should withdraw his remark and turn his attention to more worthy activities.Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said: ldquoMr Chapman should delete his pathetic, gloating tweet and apologise to all the families who have lost loved ones and our NHS professionals working flat out during the coronavirus outbreak.It is thought population density partly explains the higher death rate in England."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11263811.jpg?type=article-full","title":"use-lose---helping-support-local-diner","story":"While we canrsquot do that anymore, spare a thought for the cafeacute owner, the restaurateur, the proprietor ndash no customers, no income but with bills to pay.Thatrsquos why we have joined forces with partners web, the company behind our online business directory, to offer local food outlets a bespoke ordering service to compete with the best.

However, the RSPB says these birds are in serious trouble, with numbers plummeting in former strongholds across the UK and Europe. It is reported that the species is now vulnerable to extinction.Puffarazzi aims to find out what is causing population changes across the UK, particularly focusing on dferences in food availability related to climate change. People can join the Puffarazzi by submitting photos from visits to puffin colonies in previous years where they have snapped pictures of these colourful seabirds with food in their bills. The photos help scientists learn more about what puffins are feeding their chicks, or ‘pufflings’, and how this might have changed over time.The project first ran in  asking for photos from that summer, before ing last year with the added request for images from any year which will help build a picture of how food sources might have changed over time.The RSPB says the public response in the previous two years has been incredible:This year the project is adapting to take coronavirus guidance into account, asking people to focus on digging through their photo albums and files at home in case there are any photos tucked away from previous visits to puffin colonies that could be of use.The photos will help scientists identy areas where puffins are struggling to find enough nutritious fish needed to support their pufflings, with the historical photos providing an invaluable comparison of how food availability has changed over time.Connie Tremlett, RSPB conservation scientist and manager of the project this year, said: “We’ve been bowled over by how many people have already taken part in Puffarazzi # the response so far really shows how beloved these ‘clowns of the sea’ are, and how each and every one of us can play a part in saving them. As puffinsto our shores, we’re once again asking people to share their photos from previous years with us.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in .

The need for ventilation also draws on vital equipment and the highly-trained staff needed to operate the kit.Announcing the recovery-RStrial, the universities said it was hoped that by finding effective alternatives to invasive ventilation, they could improve patient outcomes. Researchers will compare the effects of standard care, incubation and invasive ventilation, with non-invasive treatments like use of the continuous positive airway pressuremethod, with air delivered through a tight-fitting face mask.It will also compare use of the high flow nasal oxygensystem, which delivers warmed oxygen through tubes in the nose, and the standard care of air delivered via a mask.The study was based on the theory non-invasive interventions at an earlier stage could cut the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.Professor Danny McAuley, of Queen#s University, commented: We urgently need this trial to test what is the best way to deliver respiratory support as an alternative to ventilators.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Grades for those completing these exams will be based on a combination of information provided by schools and colleges and statistical information.The news came two weeks after authorities in England and Wales had announced exam grades would be based on predicted results.Martine Mulhern, principal of St Cecilia#s College in Derry, said the awarding of grades was always going to be problematic. There was never going to be a perfect process and the Department of Education and CCEA have proposed as robust a process as is probably possible in the current circumstances, she said. There is, however, a deep-rooted concern as to the level of accountability apportioned to teachers and heads of departments in assigning a grade and rank order reflective of a student#s most probable achieved grade under normal circumstances.The use of trend data may also prove advantageous to some cohorts in schools while disadvantaging others as no two year groups in any school is exactly the same and some can be signicantly dferent.There is still a lack of clarity over a possible appeal process and I would predict that this could be a likely course of action for a number of pupils who do not get the grade they believe they should have, she added.Principal of Newtownhamilton High School Neil Megaw said there will be a lot of hard work for teachers in the months ahead as they use their previous knowledge of having taught a GCSE pupil for almost five years and existing data to award outcomes which are fair for each inidual.He added: Obviously the ideal solution for awarding Year  GCSE outcomes is through the completion of controlled assessment and written, practical or oral exams, but that is not possible this year.However, having reflected on Minister Peter Weir#s statement, I feel that the combination of using teacher professional judgement to rank pupils and predict grades along with comparison of average centre performance over recent years is the best possible alternative during this unprecedented situation.These final outcomes will hopefully take each pupil to the next stage of their chosen career path.Christos Gaitatzis, principal of Omagh High School, said the awarding of grades would not be as fair as an exam situation and further clarication is needed on what elements teachers should take into account before awarding them.We really need to look at the detail in terms of how teachers should effectively get to those predicted grades in order to give a fair representation of how students would have performed in their summer exams, he said.My biggest problem is that I hope this won#t be an exercise that will benefit pupils from grammar school backgrounds more than those in high schools. The news came while millions of pupils continue to self-isolate as coronavirus spreads across the UK and after weeks of GCSE and A-level pupils being left in limbo about their next steps.Lucy Greavesis a student at Victoria College in south Belfast.She is in her A-level year and hopes to study economics in Liverpool.I feel like this has been a long time to wait for a decision given that other parts of the UK had known what would happen there already, she said. I#m appreciative that we have got some confirmation but students still don#t knowthey#re safe or not in terms of whether they#ll meet their requirements for university.I think it#s fair that Peter Weir has taken into consideration the repeat exams that students have applied for as statistics show that they normally do better on these.Annie Heavernattends Strathearn School in east Belfast and was due to sit her GCSEs.She believes the decision is a fair one: Your teachers know probably better than anyone what you#re capable of achieving and they#ll be able to base a fair score on that.I#m happy with the conclusion that has been reached in terms of predicted grades and it has all been out of our hands anyway in what is a very unique situation.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusTeachers fear a flood of appeals over grading of exams, union tells WeirTeachers here have been left anxious that new exam arrangements during the Covid- pandemic will see multiple pupils challenge their decisions, a union official has said.,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Wayne Rodgers, a member of Magherafelt-based wedding band The Allstars, has been entertaining residents since lockdown brough an abrupt end to his normal work. “Everything has just fallen off a clf, it’s all stopped overnight,” he told the County Derry Post. “Mark Stewart, who runs a bar in Magherafelt, said some of the homes were askinghe could suggest anything entertainment-wise. “The Manor Nursing home [in Magherafelt] was the first one I did. They had me back so I couldn’t have been too bad!” googletag.cmd.push A driving instructor by day, Wayne says he wanted to bring the residents of the care homes a bit of joy at a time when they are not allowed to have visitors. He said: “I’m not an essential worker but I’m not doing anyone any harm. I’m there on my own and it’s entertainment for them and gives them something to look forward to.” “They throw a sterilised plug out the window to me and I plug that into my own equipment. There’s no contact made. “It breaks up my day. It’s as good for me as it is for them. You can hear them clapping and singing behind the windows. googletag.cmd.push  “It’s sad - some of the relatives would come and sit in cars. They can’t go in to see their parents. They can only wave through the window and it’s very tough on everybody, strained times. “Some of the homes are doing wee videos from inside and posting them online so the families can see them all enjoying themselves, singing and clapping along.” Wayne is now a man in demand as word spreads of his singing exploits, and has performances lined up both in his adopted County Derry and native town of Ballynahinch. He said: “We did one and then another got in touch. My brother in law arranged four in Ballynahinch on Monday, so I’ve done about ten now at this stage. “I don’t like forcing people or anything, but this week I’ve been asked back to a few I’ve done before because the residents are enjoying it so much. “I have another three lined up this week with a possibility of a few more coming on board.” The old classics are proving popular as Wayne does the rounds, with one song in particular being requested on every occasion. “They all seem to love Danny Boy,” he said. “It seems to bring back memories. A lot of the patients in the homes have dementia and it seems to be a song that takes them home. They like the classics, the ballads – all songs from their era.” Although the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, there was one voice of dissent who would have preferred not to have Wayne singing outside his window. “I got one negative comment. I was in Ballynahinch the other day and a man said ‘what’s your name son ’ So I answered and he said ‘well will you feck off, I can’t hear the TV!’ “He didn’t enjoy it as much as the others, but it gave everybody a laugh.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Insufficient data was available to track the footfall in Mid Ulster’s parks, but the results did show that visits to grocery and pharmacies experienced a % drop.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

To this day, the  All-Ireland winning team remains Derrys flagship group. The foundations were dug long before Anthony Tohill plucked both throw-ins in the lashing rain of Newry, that started the ball rolling towards Sam. This week Michael McMullan delves deeper, back to where it all began. On that famous September Sunday in , Seamus Downey nipped between Mark OConnor and John Kerins before fisting Damian Cassidys cross-shot to set off an explosion of red and white on Hill  behind. It was the final shudder Derry needed to wade clear of the early Cork storm and en their strides towards Sam Maguire. googletag.cmd.push Every dream begins somewhere. The s was greeted with a raft of MacRory and Hogan Cups, following on from St Pius Vocational Schools glory. Added in was an Ulster U title and four All-Ireland minor final appearances – producing two wins. It was a golden era that helped assemble the crux of a team that would dine at the top table for most of a decade. Tradition emerges in cycles. The s saw Derry seniors regularly at Croke Park. They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn.

Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board.

She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Castledawson man Dean McErlean made the discovery while walking his dogs at the foot of the Moyola River, where it enters Lough Neagh. “It says ‘Joseph McManmoy’ on it,” he told the County Derry Post. “We would take the dogs down there for a walk and let them swim and we found it lying in the sand. It was half-buried but I saw the top of it. “It doesn’t look like a medicine bottle – it’s clear. I knew it was old glass because you could still see the bubbles in it, and it wasn’t symmetrical. googletag.cmd.push “I knew it was a good age, but I didn’t know what it was for, whether it was for whiskey or medicine or anything.” Dean then took to the internet to seehe could unearth any details about the mysterious ‘Joseph McManmoy’, but his search drew a blank. “The first thing I did was Google it, but there was absolutely nothing and no name the same. It’s not a usual name. “The name has thrown everybody that I have asked because it’s so unusual.” The search for any trace of the name is still ongoing, but Dean has ensured the bottle has found a safe home. googletag.cmd.push He said: “An aunty of mine is big into traditional, vintage, oddly shaped stuff. “She would have wee medicine bottles and stuff around the house, so I took it home to her. She loved it, she was like an excited child.” While his efforts to find Mr McManmoy have not yet proved fruitful, Dean has his own theory about how the bottle came to rest on the Loughshore. “I would say it has come down the Moyola and washed out in the floods over the wintertime. God knows how long it was lying somewhere .”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In response to the Covid- pandemic, food is being delivered every week to households in need across the city as a result of the link-up between Apex Housing Association and the charity Fareshare. The surplus food supplies, collected by Fareshare from local supermarkets including Tesco and Asda, are being delivered by Apex to four areasof the city – Ballyarnett, Foyleside, The Moor and Waterside. Emergency food parcels and hot meals are also being distributed by local groups. googletag.cmd.push Donna Matthewson, Apex Director of Housing, said they were delighted with how the initiative was operating. “Over the last number of years we have developed an excellent relationship with Fareshare, delivering fresh food to eleven local charities on an on-going basis,” she said. “Recently we have seen the impact Covid- has had on families in this city and this new service with Fareshare has been established as a result. “We are delighted to be able to assist in redirecting these vital food supplies to those who need them most. “Feedback from community groups has been fantastic and we hope to continue this service for the duration of the pandemic.” googletag.cmd.push Ciara Ferguson from Greater Shantallow Area Partnership praised the food delivery scheme. “This service has allowed us to provide much needed food parcels for those who have negatively impacted by the Covid- crisis. “The food is of great quality and iety and the extra help means the world to our local families whose incomes have been reduced as a result of the pandemic.” If you or someone you know is struggling to afford or access food during the Covid- pandemic, contact your local DEA partnership office:Outer North-   Outer West-   Triax-   Waterside-     If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I thought lsquothis is itrsquo and I wasnrsquot coming out of here, so to speak to someone from home like David Moore, who knew some of my relatives, and to get that reassurance from him meant so much.ldquoHe came into to see me each day I was at the Mater and had to be suited in PPE every time he came. It was just horric.Mr Bell does not yet know where he picked up the virus, orhe passed it on to anyone . Thankfully, his fianceacutee, Bernie Henry, who shares a home with him, did not contract the virus as they were both committed to social distancing as soon as he felt unwell.He said: ldquoI work all over Northern Ireland in my job, meeting people face to face, so I could have picked it up anywhere, said Mr Bell.ldquoThe first thing I knew about it was when I came home from work on the Friday [nearly three weeks ago] feeling a bit faint and ice cold in my feet and hands. I started to have really bad headaches.ldquoTwo days later I rang the out of hours and was toldthe headaches didnrsquot get any better to go to Lagan Valley Hospital which I did. They told me go home and to self-isolate for  days which we did.Mr Bellrsquos headaches continued and after consulting his own GP he went to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald where X-rays showed that his lungs were clear and he was sent home to continue his quarantine.Then, four days later, he called for paramedics again who prescribed him antibiotics but did not admit him to hospital.The day before he was admitted to the Mater Hospital ndash the gateway hospital for all suspected COVID patients ndash Mr Bell suffered an asthma attack and felt increasingly unable to breathe at home.His fianceacutee went on the NHS COVID app the next day to describe Mr Bellrsquos symptoms where it recorded a red warning and advised to ring .Mr Bell said: ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for that, God knows where I would have been today. It took it a week for it to really hit me but when it did, it was bad.He was treated initially with strong anti-biotics to open his airways and then with oxygen from a CPAP mask to get air into his lungs.Once medics believed that Mr Bell was on his way to recovery, he was transferred to the City Hospital.He said that he felt most vulnerable when he was in separate bay with five other patients with COVID-.ldquoItrsquos hard not to worry when you are in there as you see other people struggling, said Mr Bell.ldquoBecause of the pneumonia, it was a struggle to speak, for two days I couldnrsquot speak to anyone. Bernie was not allowed in to visit me so we would text. Once I told her how afraid I was and she rang the hospital and a doctor, who was a lovely guy, came in to speak to me and reassured me that the pneumonia had been stemmed.ldquoEveryone was so good, particularly Dr Suzy Guy and Dr Liggett, who first saw me at the Mater. You see these people on the television but little did I know that they would end up treating me please.

Itrsquos a service he says he and his staff have been proud to offer.He has pupils whose parents are key NHS medics, including a couple who are both respiratory consultants, and knows the need to provide a place of shelter and safety for children of key workers is critical.ldquoEvenI had to keep the school open for one child of an NHS worker, it would be worth it, he said. ldquoMy head has said lsquoshut the schoolrsquo like the rest of them, but my heart says we are in this together and wersquove got to do our part.ldquoHowever, Irsquom not condemning any school who has closed as they have probably done so for the best of reasons.ldquoI sat in tears on Sunday evening as I didnrsquot know what I was doing was right in keeping the school open or not. We are one of the few schools offering cover for the weekends and all over Easter. Not one of my staff refused to come in to take a turn to keep the school open.ldquoIrsquove had  or more people offering to come in and help. Irsquove a great staff and they all pull together. At the end of the day, we have done our very best to safeguard the children and staff.Thankfully, Mr Moore has not received any reports of coronavirus amongst his pupils and staff, and he hopes that this status will continue.Known for not taking himself too seriously, Mr Moore has been entertaining and educating his pupils with hilarious Facebook videos of himself as educator turned entertainer. Using his considerable wit and cuddly toys as pretend schoolchildren, the principal of  years has taught mathematics, the importance of punctuation and much more over the last few weeks.He describes the incoming principal, Mr Fegan, as ldquoalmost like a son to me, and is equally proud of his other two former vice-principals, Mr Niall Stevenson and Mrs Lorna Stitt , who left the school to become principals of Downpatrick Primary School and Portavogie Primary School respectively.Mr Moore taught in primary schools in Belfast and Lisburn after he qualying in . He came to Academy as vice-principal in September  and taught a composite P-P class.He took over as principal from Mr George Smyth just five years later. The school at that time only had  children mdash it now has  children registered with double classes in all year groups and the nursery.ldquoI was appointed acting principal and Irsquove been acting principal ever since, quips Mr Moore.ldquoThe highlights for me have been many. Itrsquos been a honour not only to see children develop and flourish, but also my staff. Irsquom delighted with how my vice principals have gone on in their careers and that Mr Fegan has now been confirmed as the incoming principal after first coming here as a student teacher.ldquoIrsquove taken as much pleasure at seeing how some of my former pupils have fared in their careers and le as much as our AQE results, which are excellent. The school has also had three outstanding inspection reports in my time and apart from perhaps three rooms, the school has been completely refurbished.ldquoThe children are great ambassadors and a lot of them go on to to Down High School or Saintfield High School or Belfast grammar schools and quite often end up as head boy or head girl.His official send-off mdash a special assembly with an eveningat Temple Golf Club on June  mdash has been postponed.ldquoPersonally, itrsquos not ideal but there are people losing their lives, incomes, jobs, business are crashing, doctors and nurses putting their lives on the line, I will come back at a later stage and there will be a chance for everyone to say goodbye,said Mr Moore.ldquoTo be honest, Irsquom more upset for the Ps as most of them have been with us for eight years. Wersquove had to cancel going to Edinburgh, their leaving show which was going to be The Lion King in my honour.He said that his greatest delight at the school has been his pupils.ldquoThey are the main reason for my y tenure. It has been a joy to be their principal, he added.ldquoIt has also been an honour to have worked alongside the board of governors, both past and present, who have shared my vision for the school and supported me in its realisation.ldquoI am indebted in particular to the late Rev Alan Delamere, Mr David Donnan, Mr Geoffrey Perrin and currently Mr Peter Shaw for their leadership at the helm.ldquoThe current members of our teaching and non-teaching staff continue to reflect the professional dedication and loving care of their predecessors. I have been truly blessed to have a staff who have had a collective desire to put children first.Mr Moore also paid tribute to the parents and s for their ldquodaily partnership with the staff and your personal support to me as principal for over two decades.He and his we, Lynne, who live in Saintfield, share five children together and he says retirement will bring him a chance for them both to travel ndash when the travel ban is lted ndash and for him to devote more time to his beloved sports mdash hersquos a major football and rugby fan.He has been approached to do some educational consultancy work when he is officially retired but is happy to limit that to just several days a week.Mr Moore added: ldquoI can honestly say that during my time at Academy I have never wished that I had been a school leader anywhere  or that I was employed in an alternative profession.ldquoI will definitely shed a tear or two when I go. They will get over me, of course, as nobody is irreplaceable, but I will certainly miss the children and staff. I will not miss the responsibility of the day to day running of the place, but Irsquom a social animal and I will really miss everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Legacy.jpg","title":"The legacy of John de Courcy  ","story":"THE story starts in  when the Norman soldier-adventurer, Sir John de Courcy, went north from Dublin, the headquarters of Norman power in Ireland, and arrived at Downpatrick on February .De Courcy was a man of great physical strength and size. He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

Wersquove got the capacity to do it.Matthew went on to describe the atmosphere at Llandough Hospital.ldquoWersquore both in Penarth and wersquove lived here all our lives. Its important to us that we support it as much as possible.ldquoIts uplting being able to do that. It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With lockdown and social distancing, itrsquos crucial that we keep residents informed, and modern technology allows us to do that.One of those conversations was with Cllr Lis Burnett, Deputy Leader of the Vale Council. I raised some of the most common questions that Irsquom receiving from constituents, to find out how the authority is supporting residents, including:School provision: The Vale is using a hub system, with  schools providing services am-to-pm, seven days a week, for children of key workers and vulnerable children. Vouchers for free school meals are being issued to all who qualy every two weeks.Older shielding residents: For those without support from family and friends, the council has set up a Crisis Support Team to help with access to shopping, medication, and urgent temporary assistance. See the lsquoProtecting Vulnerable Peoplersquo section of the dedicated coronavirus page on the website www.valeofglamorgan.gov.ukBusinesses: There is a regularly-updated Business section on the councilrsquos coronavirus page, which should be the first point of call for all local businesses looking for assistance.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We must protect personal data in accordance with GDPR and for that reason personal devices cannot be used.”The DUP representative also said that while she will be doing everything in her power to support her constituents, she would be using a “minimal” amount of the allowance.“I and my staff will not be found wanting when my constituents need me the most,” she said.“In the past month we have worked tirelessly to assist many people and answer literally thousands of queries. It is vital that we have equipment that is secure and usablein a home setting.“I will be using my normal office running cost budget andrequired, a minimal amount of the £, to equip my staff for the coming months.“Their safety and ability to work at maximum capacity is of utmost importance to me.

In , the then Northern Ireland AgricultureMinister, Michelle O’Neill MLA of Sinn Fein called in the military to assist with the delivery of animal feed to stranded animals during the vicious winter period.“On the reverseside of the argument, the IrishDefence Force helicopters from the Irish Republic were used in Northern Ireland to fight bush fires.“Any MACA in Northern Ireland will be skills based, engineers, drivers, medics, planners and workforce on mass with a command and control element already built in.“The Health Minister made it clear some weeks ago that he would,needed, call for military assistance.“The Sinn Fein Finance Minister, Conor Murphy MLA, made it clear he would not object to such a move and the Justice Minister, NaomiLong MLA, has clearly liaised with the military to create a resting facility within Kinnegar Barracks.”He went on: “Nobody in Northern Ireland will askPersonal Protective Equipmentor ventilatorswere provided by a military driver or civilian driver when they are gasping for breath ora doctor treating them is military or not. They will just want to live.”The SDLP’s Upper Bann MLA, Dolores Kelly said: “There would be no role for military personnel in security matters but in the middle of a public health emergency, political leaders must be prepared to do the uncomfortable thing to save lives.“It would be wrong to pick partisan fights over emergency measures necessary to save lives and protect the health service staff. We must all be prepared to do what it takes to save lives.”The DUP councillor Darryn Caubsy warmly welcomed the Army’s involvement: “The British Armed forces are the best in the world and their skills and experience will indeed be a welcome boost to those fighting this pandemic on the front line.“These are unprecedented times and we must work collectively to defeat this virus. I appeal to everyone to Stay home, Stay Safe, Save lives.”The Alliance Party’s Eoin Tennyson said his party also “welcome any and all support” at this time: “Ultimately, families with a loved one in hospital will be more concerned about their prognosis than who delivered the equipment.“The Minister has the Alliance Party’s full support in taking these extraordinary steps to try and save lives. That must be the number one priority for us all.”When asked for comment, a Sinn Fein spokesperson referred to the statement released by Michelle O’Neill on April .“I have been informed that the Minister for Health has unilaterally and without consultation with Executive colleagues requested limited assistance from the British Army,” said the deputy First Minister.“Sinn Féin has made it clear we will not rule out any measure necessary to save lives, protect the public and tackle the spread of coronavirus.“However, no proposal to use British military personnel in the north for roles normally performed by civilians has come before the Executive.”She continued: “The Health Minister has a responsibility to exhaust all options, including the use of other blue light public services and civilian contractors, to ensure that ventilators and le saving equipment are moved swtly to where they are needed most.“The Department for Health has already contracted a local civilian contractor to scope out building a HSC-led civilian ‘field hospital’.“It remains Sinn Féin’s position that any proposed new Nightingale hospital should remain under the care and control of the HSC.She said Sinn Féin is seeking an urgent meeting with the health minister and will also be “seeking meetings with the Secretary of State, the Tanáiste and the PSNI.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In the latter case, pupils will have the option to take any outstanding units in  and have missing components calculated using statistical modelling and or to sit all units in  and be awarded the higher grade from either option.Speaking in the Assembly today, Peter Weir said: “In March, I announced that, in line with other jurisdictions of the UK, GCSE, AS and A level exams would not proceed in Northern Ireland in summer .“My priority is to ensure that pupils receive fair results that reflect their hard work and enable judgements to be made about their future progression to study or employment or other avenues.“CCEA, the local examinations body, together with officials from my departments and others in the education sector have been working tirelessly to develop an alternative process.“This is a very complex process and there is still more work to be completed, however, it is vital that pupils and their families receive some clarity on this issue.” Consultation on the preferred options has been carried out with key education stakeholders, including head teachers’ representatives and teaching unions.The Minister said: “Today, I have set out how qualications will be awarded for GCSE and A level pupils. This will involve teachers using their professional judgement together with an extensive range of evidence held by schools, and statistical modelling. There will also be a process for standardising outcomes across school and other examination centres.“The development of an appropriate appeals mechanism is also under consideration, as well as arrangements for private candidates.“Whilst there will not be an opportunity for pupils to take re-sits in the autumn, they can, of course, choose to re-sit in the summer of .
