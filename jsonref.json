Last year, the World Health Organisation recognised \u0027gaming disorder\u0027 among the diseases it monitors. It said computer game playing becomes a disorder when it has an impact on personal or family relationships and impairs socialising, education or other key areas of life for 12 months or more.A survey of 2,000 British parents this year found that around 50 per cent were concerned that their children were becoming gaming addicts. It was not uncommon for 11 to 13-year-olds to play computer games for two-and-a-half hours on a school day and almost six hours a day at the weekend.

The crime isn’t the centre of the story, more its impact on Beetle’s CEO, Guy, whose aura rests on the accuracy of his predictive algorithms, which – nourished by 247 surveillance of everything from browser history to heart rate – are supposed to pre‑empt such atrocities.The early part of the novel catalogues the ills of life in a data-driven dictatorship, in which the poor are jailed before they can commit crimes, and you need BeetleBits, Beetle’s cryptocurrency, for “basic functioning in society”. But you can only earn them by working for Beetle, which only hires the best a degree helps, but universities only accept payment in… you guessed it.Policing is down to Anti-Terror Droids, which compound the error of not catching Mann by instead executing an innocent veteran, Lionel Bigman, in yet another “Zed moment” – Beetle’s term for random mishaps, by which it seeks to wash its hands of responsibility. This hardly plays well with Guy’s prospective business partners in China.Subplots fizz everywhere – including Guy’s wife pointedly revenge-sleeping with a bookseller fond of letter writing. But the main thread hangs on a rebel movement, the League of the Unverifieds, whose radical underground action prompts a crisis of conscience in a bought-off newspaper editor, David Strachey (who reported Bigman’s killing as “suicide by droid”), while affirming the doubts of Eloise Jayne, a counterterrorist sceptical of the 21st-century sus laws she’s ordered to enforce.A brainy, bustling novel, Zed is hugely enjoyable as well as hard going at times: robotic chit-chat from ubiquitous Very Intelligent Personal Assistants, as well as a blizzard of acronyms and Beetle’s own Newspeak (“Bespoke”), added to the fact that much of the firm’s senior-level discussion takes place in virtual reality, or “Real Virtuality” (in which, for instance, “the Real Douglas Varley” speaks alongside “the actually real Douglas Varley”), can make for a bumpy ride.What’s great about it, though, is that Kavenna uses her scenario not only for horror, but laughter, too, as a send-up of corporate hubris and government heedlessness. Beetle targets London because the UK is “the most advanced benign regulatory environment in the world” the prime minister is mentioned for the first time only a few pages from the end, and even then Kavenna says her name isn’t important. As for Brexit? Compared with Beetle, or whichever voracious duosyllable it’s a proxy for, it seems to be irrelevant, which may be this madcap satire’s most chilling point.• Zed by Joanna Kavenna is published by Faber \u0026amp Faber (£16.99).

In times past, it was simple. The monarch, not just a symbol of society but then its embodiment, proffered wealth, land and title. In these halcyon days of democracy, neither the Queen nor the prime minister can give chums and lackeys pots of gold and tracts of Lincolnshire, but some things stay the same: on our behalf, they still distribute preferment in the form of honours.It is truly an anachronism and by tinkering with its flaws, those who control the system yearly seek to make it more reflective of a modern age. But they delude themselves, for even on its own terms as a rough and ready mechanism for giving all sections of society the chance to be recognised for outstanding service and contribution, the system does not work.We hand out about 2,000 honours each year in the Queen’s birthday honours list and the new year honours list. But there’s an issue those who administer the process are loth to recognise.This system of societal reward carries on against the backdrop of a never-ending drumbeat of appeals, indeed an insistence, that Britons from minority backgrounds should play a full and constructive role in making this a fair and equal society. But it is a system that speaks not of Britain today or even the Britain of this century, but of Britain and its long-passed empire. It offers honours in our name, such as Order of the British Empire, that many deserving people – artists, musicians, doctors, professors, sports stars, activists, politicians – cannot in good conscience accept.For many minorities, the empire is much more than a historical footnote. Its enduring symbols and psychological legacies remain a live issue and an open wound. To accept this type of preferment is to attach them inextricably to a thing that they despise to forge a link with Britain’s past that would, to many they respect or might wish to represent, be unacceptable. Is that desirable or right? Having spent time speaking to minority Britons who have been obliged to confront this dilemma, I don’t think it is.I don’t want to overstate the case. Minority Britain is not a monolith. Some nominated minority Britons go happily to Buckingham Palace, unencumbered by qualms or the baggage of empire. I asked Samir Shah, the celebrated TV executive and former chair of the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, how long it took him to accept his OBE in 2000 (upgraded this year to a CBE). “A nanosecond,” he told me.But others have refused outright. Think of the writer Benjamin Zephaniah, who roundly and very publicly rejected an OBE in 2003. “I thought that it wasn’t just good enough for me to just say no and just leave it quietly,” he told me. “I think I had to make a big statement to people generally, but especially to people in my community, to say, look, we don’t have to do this.”Then there’s Howard Gayle, the first black footballer to break through into the Liverpool team in the 1980s and now a tireless community worker. He told me his decision to turn down an MBE for his work with the anti-racism group Kick It Out was a no-brainer. “We’ve got a long history in colonialism and slavery and we’ve never, ever been thought of as a culture deserving of an apology for what was done to us and to our ancestors.”Both men made a choice and happily live with it. But I say they shouldn’t have had to make it. Both accept honours from within their own communities. It’s the mainstream honours, wider society’s mode of recognition, they have a specific problem with.For some, the decision can be agonising. Should they accept an honour they may want and feel they deserve, knowing that to do so leaves them open to sometimes very public and always very hurtful censure and hostility? The broadcaster and community activist Dotun Adebayo, who was appointed MBE in 2009 for services to the arts, told me of receiving his offer in the post. He handed the letter to his mother-in-law. “I was thinking this is an issue now. I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to accept this. So I wasn’t jumping for joy,” Adebayo said. In the end, he took the medal from the Princess Royal. Last year, conflicted again as the Windrush scandal played out, with all its resonance of betrayal and bad faith, he sought advice from readers of the black newspaper the Voice as to whether he should send it back.The author and columnist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown took an MBE in 2001, but “shamed”, as she puts it, by a TV appearance opposite Zephaniah in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war, she packaged it up and sent it back. Tragi-comically, she was unsure who to return it to. “It stuck in my throat,” she told me. “Anybody who knows anything knows that that history will never be over in the United Kingdom. It’s in the blood and we’ve seen it all rise up again after Brexit. For all sorts of reasons, I should never have taken it.”Last month, Simon Woolley, the co-founder and director of Operation Black Vote and chair of the government’s race equality audit panel, became Sir Simon Woolley. He had been tipped off that an offer might come and spent two months wrestling with it. “It was awful,” he told me. “There were two voices. One said to me, ‘Please, you must accept.’ The other asked, ‘What am I accepting?’ I sat down during those two months and, whichever way I dressed it up, I couldn’t see anything positive about the empire.” He discerned positives in the recognition of Operation Black Vote and opportunities for his future equalities work. His research established his knighthood was a medieval title and empire was not mentioned in the announcement or citation. That was a relief. But should people – of low or high station, famous or unknown – have to agonise in this way?Fifteen years ago, when a select committee reviewed our honours system, it said the OBE, shorn of empire, should become the Order of British Excellence, because “the current nomenclature of honours makes it difficult for some potential recipients to accept them”. MPs didn’t think they were asking for a great deal, but it was too much for traditionalists.The empire has gone but we cling to its traces. Just recently, hard Brexit types have been dreaming of a Commonwealth association that might be seen as Empire 2.0. If ultra-conservatives truly insist on the right to maintain an empire link to public reward, couldn’t we at least offer conscientious objectors a parallel societal recognition they can easily accept? MPs new to the House of Commons are allowed to swear or affirm, with neither approach deemed inferior nor superior. So are witnesses in British courts, a tradition stretching back to the 17th century, when it was feared criminals were going free because Quakers would not swear on the Bible in court. Why not extend the same concept of reasonable accommodation to our honours?The receipt of honours should be a celebratory moment. For most people, it is. But there’s an empire problem: it’s well known, long established and easily remedied. A system that makes it morally difficult for deserving people to accept society’s gratitude is not fit for purpose.The Empire Strikes Black is on Radio 4 at 8pm on Monday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54b978746540ec7d142ba6ab8dd285bb5436418/0_75_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34ee893abb1057af315eb32d181ef61c","title":"ottawa the ultimate seven day itinerary","story":"Where else can you cycle river paths, shop farmers’ markets, and watch city lights from a hot tub? Welcome to Ottawa – Canada’s bustling capitalMondayOttawa’s most notable building is its majestic gothic parliament and it’s one of the landmarks you can take in when exploring the city on foot. Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don’t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city’s most happening central district and one of Canada’s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill.TuesdayIf the weather’s fair then don’t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa’s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check.With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it’s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city’s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views.Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You’ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves – though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel.At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums – they’re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada’s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35.Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children’s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play.There’s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There’s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours – on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling.You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits \u0026amp Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset.Enjoy Ottawa’s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves – you can even feed many of them. There’s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America’s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting – try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September.Ottawa’s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe’s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67’s play ice hockey. Between them, there’s at least one fixture most weeks, often on Sundays. Round your busy week off with a well-earned nightcap at Chateau Lafayette, also known as the Laff, Ottawa’s oldest tavern (it dates from 1849).Photography: Cole Burston for the  except lead image and the view from Gatineau Hills (Alamy)Plan your trip to Ottawa with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e80be27907852c24a459a7563a195d311552c1e/0_133_5598_3359/master/5598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ada2a2d5e223de639e9e877e4b5852c9","title":"international incident work mistake official secrets film","story":"It was the Observer’s big scoop of 2003, and as a young journalist, I was asked to type up a top-secret memo. Now my mess-up has made it to the big screenHave you ever wondered who’d play you in a film? I had, occasionally, until the day I got the answer. In spring 2018, a message pinged on to my phone via Facebook from a journalist friend. “So this is a bit weird,” it read. “A sister of a friend is playing you in a movie, apparently. You aware of this?” I wasn’t.“Hanako Footman is playing you in the film Official Secrets. She wants to meet you, like actors do. She saw we were pals and asked if I’d ask you. What did you do in that story?”“That story” concerns British whistleblower Katharine Gun, played by Keira Knightley in a film that premiered at Sundance festival in January. Fluent in Mandarin, the 28-year-old Gun was employed as a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham. In 2003, she leaked a top-secret memo to the Observer about an illegal spying operation ordered by the US National Security Agency. It intended to bug the phones and emails of six United Nations delegates, from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan – nations that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq.The memo, which outraged Gun, ordered staff to increase surveillance operations “particularly directed at… UN Security Council members (minus US and GBR, of course)” to provide real-time intelligence for Bush officials on voting intentions. I was working at the Observer at the time. And, although I was just a bit-player in the story, the film dramatises a monumental mess-up on my behalf – the biggest mistake of my career.It’s 2003. The airwaves are filled with Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love, Justin Timberlake’s Cry Me A River and Hey Ya! by OutKast. Cool young things wear absurdly small clothing – low-slung jeans nicknamed “bumsters”, for obvious reasons thongs crop tops and, most ill-advisedly, “shrugs”, unflattering miniature cardigans. An incredible heatwave sweeps Europe, too, with the mercury hitting 38.5C in Brogdale, Kent.The feverishness of those days extends to geopolitics. Three years earlier, George W Bush narrowly won the 2000 US presidential election after a recount in Florida and a debacle involving hanging chads. In 2001 came the terrorist attacks of 911, propelling al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden into the public consciousness. Britain’s “special relationship” with the US grew ever closer, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.It was an interesting time for a young journalist with no newspaper experience to be joining the foreign desk of the Observer. Aged 24 and having held only junior positions at women’s magazines, I applied for the role of foreign desk assistant in late 2002. State-schooled in Sussex and with no newspaper contacts, I had a thirst for foreign news. As a teenager, my heroes had been foreign correspondents Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and John Simpson. At university I devoured the works of George Orwell – himself a former Observer journalist – Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn and Graham Greene, before devoting a year of my degree to the impact of reporting on the Vietnam war. What I offered in keenness must have made up for my lack of experience because, after two interviews, I took a call and was told: “You’ve got the job… if you want it?” Of course I did.Joining was a culture shock. Our working week ran from Tuesday to Saturday, with knocking-off times getting progressively later (9, 10, 11pm) as Sunday approached. Everyone was constantly available on their BlackBerry – the height of tech at the time. The neighbouring Coach \u0026amp Horses pub was our unofficial canteen. My colleagues were impressive: charismatic raconteurs, supremely well-read and worldly wise. I was entrusted with an A4 contacts book – a ringbinder of phone and satellite phone numbers and emails for correspondents all over the globe. Dusty reporters would fly in from assignments in far-flung places, handing over a bundle of disorganised receipts for obscure items: four camels, for instance, “replacements for a herd accidentally hit and killed on a road by driver”.It was intense, collegiate and fun, and I felt privileged to be part of the team – but also out of my depth. My brilliant predecessor had left to make documentaries for Channel 4. I set about looking after flak jackets and foreign currency, visas and travel plans. I called to check in with reporters on high-risk assignments and watched the international news wires for stories. Not long after I started, I was asked to look into flights for a foreign correspondent to go from London to Diyarbakir and then help find a fixer to assist with crossing a border. I didn’t even know which country that was, let alone which border they might be crossing.Towards the end of my second week, I was handed a printout of an email by Martin Bright (then the Observer’s home affairs editor, played in Official Secrets by Matt Smith) and Peter Beaumont (the foreign affairs editor – played by Matthew Goode). Could I type it up and save it into the system? I wasn’t given any other information. Their only instruction: “Don’t make any mistakes.” And so I set to painstakingly typing in each sentence.Importance HIGHTop SecretAllAs you’ve likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge…… We’d appreciate your support in getting the word to your analysts who might have similar, more in-direct access to valuable information from accesses in your product lines.It took about 10 minutes. I double-checked it, sent it through, moved on to my next task.On Sunday morning, I woke up to see the paper’s front-page splash: “Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war”. Underneath was the memo I’d typed up.Of course, the story – broken by Bright, Beaumont and the inimitable New York correspondent and investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy (played with great aplomb and accuracy in the film by Rhys Ifans) – was huge. But my pride in being a tiny part of the team soon crumbled when, first thing on Monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unknown number and, as Monday was a day off for most of the news team, I didn’t expect it to be the office. It was – I think – Stephen Pritchard, the paper’s readers’ editor. He was very polite, but informed me with deft understatement and a total lack of drama that I had caused “something of an international incident”.Fastidiously typing in the memo, and not knowing what the document was or its origins, I’d changed all the American spelling “mistakes” to British English. “Recognize” became recognise, and “emphasize” emphasise. “Favorable” was amended to favourable. I thought I was being helpful. Instead, it was a disaster.The story that Gun had risked so much to reveal was thrown into doubt. How could this be a leaked US memo, asked websites such as the Drudge Report, when it was all spelled in British English? The wobble caught on. Was it a fake? Some outlets due to report on the Observer’s story cancelled interviews over doubts about the memo’s authenticity. It was decided the readers’ editor should publish a special dispatch to counter the thousands of complaints from readers, many American, calling us “lying limey bastards”, claiming that the story’s authors had fallen victim to a hoax and that the email was part of a campaign of misinformation.Of course, it was not. Despite my “administrative error”, the story still made shockwaves around the world. Some days later, Gun went on to reveal her identity, and her life imploded she lost her job, was arrested and ultimately faced a trial under the Official Secrets Act, which collapsed after the prosecution declined to offer its evidence.Meanwhile, I struggled to make peace with the ramifications of what I’d done. Humiliated, and just a few weeks into my dream job, I rang my former magazine editor and asked for my old job back it had, of course, been filled.By Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but go in and face the music. I assumed I’d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk. But while I am sure everyone involved was cursing my name – one of the biggest stories of their careers had been plunged into unnecessary doubt – they were outwardly kind and magnanimous. I was summoned to meet Pritchard and Bright to explain what had happened, and while there were a few eye rolls I think they understood why I’d done what I did, being in the dark about the genesis of the document. How the mistake wasn’t spotted by anyone else was also a matter of some consternation.Somehow, I managed to put the disaster behind me. The senior editors forgave me, and I remained on the foreign desk for three years.When, 16 years later, I found out that not only was the story being made into a film, but my mistake had been included, I had some sleepless nights. I met Footman, the young actor who plays me, at a cafe in London early last year with some trepidation. She told me she couldn’t ulge any specifics about the movie. “But is it made clear I wasn’t fired over what happened?” I asked. She was noncommittal, but said I did appear in a later scene. She wanted to talk details: what did I wear back in the day? What colour did I paint my fingernails? How did I get on with my colleagues? What were the foreign correspondents like? “Most of my outfits were probably too casual,” I said. “I was frequently hungover and more than once fell asleep in the canteen.” And how to describe the foreign correspondents? Simultaneously impressive and unpredictable.Around nine months after we met, I was invited to a first-cut screening of the film. I watched as “Nicole” got bawled out by the Observer’s famously sweary then editor, Roger Alton (played by Conleth Hill, Lord Varys in Game Of Thrones) in front of the entire team – thankfully not something that happened in real life. Footman played a blinder as me – albeit a more groomed version.I knew it would be hard to watch my mistake unfold, but when it came, it felt like being punched in the throat. I felt the shame all over again, and sobbed silently into my tissue. Nevertheless, the film is as brilliant as it is important. And while I wouldn’t recommend carrying the burden of a catastrophic fuck-up, as Alton would term it, through one’s career, it did provide a salutary lesson in attention to detail. It was my first serious mistake, and hopefully it will be my last.• Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 OctoberIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60bceb9ac7fe8454bba0b062a882f06f0a0d7625/0_66_3111_1867/master/3111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdd9cecfbf7f6074b5f7ba7607ba0a70","title":"arsenal lyon alexandre lacazette injury","story":"They were beaten in their own cup final but the more significant events were happening off the pitch for Arsenal as the Premier League kick-off looms ever closer for Unai Emery’s men.Alexandre Lacazette will be Emery’s primary concern after the striker left the stadium in a protective boot following their defeat by Lyon in the Emirates Cup after sustaining what is hoped to be a minor ankle sprain.Then there is the welfare of Mesut Özil and Sead Kolasinac who were deemed not ready to play in this match after being involved in a carjacking incident last week.Finally, there is the potential record signing of the winger Nicolas Pépé, with a £70m deal rumoured to be nearing completion. After that, the fact of a Moussa Dembélé double cancelling out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s opener seemed by the by.“We are thinking the Lacazette injury is not serious,” Emery said. “He decided with the doctor and with me not to take a risk. It is better in pre-season to do that. It’s in his ankle, it’s a sprain. He will be assessed over the next few days but it is not serious.”As for Pépé, the 24-year-old is expected to have a medical this week before his move. It has been widely reported a £72m fee has been agreed with Lille but Emery refused to add any information when asked about the transfer.“We are thinking about how we can improve the club,” he said. “Pépé is a very good player and we are only thinking about players that can improve this squad and give us different conditions.”The game itself was a familiar story – Arsenal dominated the first half and were undone by lapses of concentration in the second. One upside was the performance of the young Gunners. Reiss Nelson replaced the injured Lacazette after 15 minutes and he joined another 19-year-old, Joe Willock, in the attack. Both acquitted themselves well, good on the ball and in finding space, albeit lacking a clinical touch in their finishing.Profligacy is a familiar complaint for Arsenal fans but they do not have to worry about Aubameyang. Last season’s Golden Boot winner opened the scoring with a typically well-executed strike. Henrikh Mkhitaryan found him at the front post with a chipped cross from the right. The Gabon international met the ball with what looked like an ungainly finish that took all the pace off the ball but put it precisely where he wanted, just inside the far post.The hosts began the second half as they left the first with the 20-year-old Eddie Nketiah joining the fray and spurning a glorious headed opportunity from six yards out. Dani Ceballos made his first appearance in a red and white shirt since joining on loan from Real Madrid. A second goal did not come and soon they were pegged back.Dembélé entered the game as a half-time substitute, forcing the former Manchester United player Memphis Depay out to the left. The Dutchman had struggled in a central role but he set up the equaliser by standing up Ainsley Maitland-Niles and spinning a cross to the penalty spot. Dembélé was waiting, a yard clear of his marker Calum Chambers, and he steered his head across goal and beyond the reach of Bernd Leno.The winning goal came eight minutes later as Dembélé ran on to a perfect through ball from Houssem Aouar to finish coolly past the German again.Earlier in the day Arsenal Women lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich in their Emirates Cup debut. The WSL champions were largely outclassed by their German counterparts and a fearsome ing header from the captain, Melanie Leupolz, was a fitting way to decide the game.Starting without several of their World Cup stars, including Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema, Arsenal foundered against a well-drilled Bayern backline and the visitors had chances to extend their lead in the second half.The striker Jovana Damnjanovic failed to score when one on one with Manuela Zinsberger while Giulia Gwinn saw her backheeled flick run just past the post after a swish passing move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85258ea7b5c415b42a279c92fb5974af201ad385/48_80_2367_1420/master/2367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=592ddba73537ea1509a7ed93d23ee783","title":"gareth bale move china blocked by real madrid board","story":"• Wales winger had been set to join Jiangsu Suning• Bale’s relationship with Zidane had broken downGareth Bale looks set to remain at Real Madrid, a club that does not want him, after the board blocked his lucrative transfer to China.The Wales winger had been expected to join the Chinese Super League side Jiangsu Suning on a three-year deal this week with a contract worth more than £1m a week. That move is now off after the Real’s board reportedly decided they want a transfer fee for the player who joined from Tottenham in 2013 for a then world-record fee of £85m.The Real president, Florentino Pérez, is believed to have requested an extra payment to sign the 30-year-old, who has three years remaining on the contract he signed in 2016, which is worth around £600,000 a week.With the Chinese transfer window closing on Wednesday, Bale’s hopes of sealing a move away from the Santiago Bernabéu this summer could now rest on him finding another club in Europe, with Real said to be prepared to let him join a Champions League rival for the right price.The English transfer window shuts on 8 August – the day before the start of the new season – but no Premier League clubs have expressed an interest in signing one of the world’s best-paid players.Despite coming off the bench for the second successive match as Real were thrashed 7-3 by Atlético Madrid in New Jersey on Saturday as well as Marco Asensio’s extended absence due to a knee injury, Bale’s prospects of being reintegrated into Zinedine Zidane’s first team still appear slim after the Frenchman’s sustained a very public campaign to move him out of the club.After leaving Bale out of a pre-season game against Bayern Munich last week, which Real lost, Zidane said he hoped the player would be sold. “We hope he leaves soon,” he said. “It would be best for everyone. We are working on his transfer to a new team. I have nothing personal against him but there comes a time where things are done because they must be done.”Bale’s representatives are understood to be disappointed with Real’s stance after negotiating the deal with Jiangsu over the past fortnight and with time running out to secure an alternative destination for next season. He has won four Champions League titles with the club but has been sidelined by Zidane since he returned to Madrid this spring for a second spell as manager – a decision described as bad news by Bale’s agent, Jonathan Barnett.According to the Spanish newspaper Marca, often a mouthpiece for the Real board and Pérez in particular, the breakdown in negotiations with Jiangsu – whose owners Suning also own Internazionale – was caused by a request from Bale’s own family, who would reportedly prefer to stay in Europe.Zidane remains keen to have the situation resolved quickly, with a potential move for Manchester United’s Paul Pogba possibly dependent on finding a buyer for Bale. Real have already spent close to £300m on recruits this summer but they must balance the books with player sales if they are to finance a move for the France midfielder who will cost in excess of £100m.Bale has made 79 La Liga starts in the past four years but with Barnett having ruled out a loan move this summer he could find himself left in limbo this season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f89e63c910fe402ee087835f57c7a6d562e2ea0/0_137_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aee204123fdbeb5a5971c3accc1206b","title":"reading chelsea friendly match report frank lampard","story":"Frank Lampard urged Chelsea’s fans to drop a chant that contains an offensive reference to the travelling community after his side continued their encouraging form with victory over Reading at the Madejski Stadium.While the chant celebrates Lampard’s goalscoring exploits during his playing days for Chelsea, it also contains an insulting description of West Ham as “pikeys”. Chelsea’s new manager began his career at West Ham and he had a troubled relationship with his boyhood team after leaving for Stamford Bridge in 2001.“I didn’t hear the song in question and of course, if there’s a song in the modern day or any day that has offensive words, I don’t want to hear that,” Lampard said. “That’s me saying that as a big Chelsea man who really appreciates the support.“We don’t want songs with offensive words. If the fans could sing other songs, then I’ll back that. The club are very clear with the work we do off the pitch about anything that’s offensive or prejudiced and we’ve made a big mark on that in modern years.”There were also concerns for Lampard on the pitch, even though he was delighted to see Ross Barkley score a stunning free-kick and Mason Mount press his claims for regular involvement this season with a ruthless double.Chelsea struggled to strike the right balance between defence and attack against their Championship opponents and must sharpen up before opening their Premier League campaign with a trip to Manchester United on 11 August.Their defensive flaws were exposed by the absence of N’Golo Kanté and Lampard could do with the Frenchman recovering from his knee injury in time to face United. “I am hopeful he will be ready,” Lampard said. “He’s dipped into training with us in the last couple of days. There’s still a lot more he needs to do physically without us. But the signs are good.“I’ll have to assess next week whether we throw him straight in.He has a natural base of fitness but there’s 50- or 60-odd games to come this season. We have to be slightly careful.”It is unlikely Lampard was impressed with what he saw from Tiémoué Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater in central midfield. A poor miss from Bakayoko demonstrated why he could be sold before the transfer window shuts next month.Reading were a goal to the good when the Frenchman blazed over from close range, Josh Barrett’s looping volley giving them a deserved lead in the 13th minute, and the hosts were a constant threat from set pieces.Chelsea restored some order when Barkley whipped a free-kick past João Virginia, who was at fault when Kenedy beat him from long range shortly before the interval.Reading, who begin their campaign with a home game against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday, pegged them back when Mark Morrison tapped in Charlie Adam’s corner.Chelsea regained the lead when Mount blasted home and the midfielder added a farcical second after Sam Walker, on for Virginia, made a doomed attempt to play out from the back.There is hope for Chelsea’s academy products under Lampard. Mount was assured in midfield, Fikayo Tomori started in central defence and Tammy Abraham had a positive impact in attack in the second half. No wonder Callum Hudson-Odoi is close to signing a new five-year deal. “Talks moved on very well in the last week or two but it’s not done yet,” Lampard said. “I want to keep him here. He’s a player we cherish.”Chelsea still made life difficult for themselves after Mount’s second, letting Sam Baldock pull one back in the dying stages and leaving Lampard to ponder what to do with his squad’s lesser lights. “There are decisions I have to make,” he said. “Without a doubt. I’ll make them in due course. They’re not absolutely clear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89bb55e3cdbea19cce21a3c96485b49a95bd6097/0_1466_3974_2383/master/3974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7430443c680b67921f7fd90cf66ba9c","title":"looking for mr t the politicisation of testosterone and toxic masuclinity","story":"Alt-right activists believe low testosterone is resulting in a crisis of masculinity. But is ‘low-T’ really to blame for making men ‘soft’ – or is the politicisation of the hormone more sinister? Sam Wolfson reportsFlorida was on a knife-edge during the 2016 US presidential election. Almost every poll had it too close to call. In the final few weeks before the vote, a rash of ads appeared on radio and TV claiming that Hillary Clinton was too frail, too liberal and too ethically compromised to become president.Dr Dareld Morris, the owner of a small medical clinic in Florida, recorded and paid for his own anti-Clinton ad. Unlike the others, he suggested a vote for the Democratic candidate wasn’t merely the wrong political choice, but the result of a chemical imbalance. “Hi guys, Doc Morris here,” it began in a chirpy, mattress-salesman tone. “Most are not aware of the negative effects low-T can have on your mental state, for instance, your ability to focus and think clearly… So, as a community service, I have this special offer: for any guys out there that are thinking of voting for Hillary, I want to offer you a free testosterone test. Just come in and register in my office in Fort Myers and let’s see if we can help.”Not many people took Morris’s ad too seriously most news outlets were pleased for a frothy story in an election that was short on light relief. Even Morris himself back-pedalled slightly, telling local news that the ad was just an “experiment”, although he added: “I’m actually voting for Donald Trump, so I think it’s even more funnier.”Yet in the years since, it has become a strange kind of orthodoxy among American conservatives that being a liberally minded man who supports feminism is simply a result of having abnormally low levels of testosterone. Like much of conspiracy conservatism, it began on message boards where various alt-right activists gather. There, being “low-T” has become the ultimate insult, alongside other masculinity-challenging burns such as “cuck”, “soyboy” and “beta”. On Reddit’s biggest Trump community, The Donald, there are thousands of posts that say things like “POST-VEGAS CUCKOLDRY: Low-T Leftist Decides to Virtue Signal by Turning in His Guns.” There’s also a “low-T beta male starter pack” that includes pictures of Bernie Sanders and desert boots.But it’s an idea that’s spread quickly to the political mainstream. When then-attorney general Jeff Sessions suddenly became more active in trying to prosecute White House leakers, Republican congressman Matt Gaetz suggested he’d started “taking those supplements for low-T”.During the campaign, Trump’s own testosterone levels were revealed during a special episode of the talkshow Dr Oz, certainly a presidential first. The audience whooped and cheered as Oz confirmed that Trump’s T-score of 441 was “good”.Politicians have long believed that demonstrating physical strength projects strength as a leader. But the obsession with testosterone is about more than being able to win in a fight. Testosterone is an often-misunderstood hormone, present in both men and women. It plays an important role in sexual function and having a lot of it can help you build muscle, but it also helps with cognition, energy and mood. People with low testosterone are more likely to have multiple chronic health conditions (although researchers argue that a causal link has not been proven). So saying someone has low testosterone taps into a murky mix of insecurities: about not being manly, lacking assertiveness and being unable to satisfy sexually.In reality, levels of testosterone are far more complex to understand. Only a small percentage of total testosterone molecules are “free” to be used by the body, and levels change constantly depending on your mood, time of day and other environmental factors. Nor is it true that testosterone makes you more athletic – this issue has come to a head in the case of Caster Semenya. But the IAAF’s own analysis of 1,100 female runners found that in three of the 11 running events, women with lower testosterone performed better than those with higher levels.The truth is that most men experience a decline in testosterone levels from around the age of 30 and, until recently, most people thought of having low testosterone as part of a kind of “male menopause”, an issue for older men with waning libidos. But this new, politicised, understanding of testosterone isn’t just about ageing. It’s succinctly explained in a video entitled The Truth About Soy Boys made by Paul Joseph Watson, a member of Ukip and one of the shining lights of Britain’s alt-right community.Watson demonstrates that many of the politically correct left-wingers he despises are also committed vegans and argues that because foods like soya milk and tofu contain oestrogen, and oestrogen lowers testosterone, they are making vegans more feminine and therefore more liberal – or as he puts it: “Buzzfeed-watching, tofu-eating, male-feminist virtue-signalling, beta-orbiter soy boys.”In other words, men as a group are becoming softer and there’s science to prove it. To reverse the trend, we just need to boost our testosterone. What could be better grist for the mill for those trying to make America great again or take back control?Big pharma has been quick to offer miracle cures to this apparent ill. I first came across this strange linking between Trumpish rhetoric and hormone treatments watching TV adverts in America. One, for a product called Ageless Male, asks: “When did it become OK for men to become softer, lazier, weaker?” The same brand offers a free month’s trial if you text the promo code “wimp” to its hotline.Since those adverts began, there’s been an increase in the number of men seeking to boost their testosterone levels. In the US, more than 1 million men have been getting new tests for testosterone levels and more than 283,000 initiated testosterone treatment in a four-year period.That impact is being felt in the UK, too. High-street pharmacies, as well as online start-ups, are now offering testosterone testing, letting men do at-home blood tests to help satiate or stoke their fears.Stricter controls on television advertising in the UK mean that pro-testosterone thinking is being stoked in books and online. The charge is led by Daniel Kelly, a fitness coach from Stoke-on-Trent who has written his own book advocating testosterone-replacement therapy (TRT) for young people. It’s called Optimized Under 35: How to Boost Your Testosterone, Increase Your Sex Drive and Achieve Incredible Health.Kelly’s book is typical of the way testosterone devotees like to blend their version of science with a conservative worldview. In the introduction he talks about how testosterone use helped him with his anxiety and libido, and promises that the book will advise any reader how to reap the same benefits. Much of the book includes highly technical hormone advice and references to scientific studies.But the science is blended with sentiments more familiar to late-night listeners of LBC. “The movement to empower women has swung the pendulum too far,” he writes. “Young men are brainwashed with anti-male vitriol…” and so on.Kelly sees this not just as a crisis of masculinity, but a crisis of testosterone indeed he says the two are “inseparable”. In one passage he writes: “This low-T reality has infested many areas of society to the point that it’s unacceptable to bring up traditional or conservative views in polite conversation… make no mistake, it’s not ‘toxic masculinity’ that’s the problem, it’s the toxic progressive ideology that hates anything masculine that poses a real problem to society.”It would be easy to dismiss this as meninist nonsense, yet a part of me also thinks I would feel quietly emasculated if I were to discover I had low-T. It makes me think of the way false versions of femininity have long been measured in expensive grooming regimes and unrealistic body types. Even politically aware feminists can still feel inadequate staring at a size-zero model. Those are pressures that men have found it easier to avoid. Yet now, here we are creating our own field in which to feel deficient and unmanly – one which is completely invisible.To find out where I stand, I order a £50 T-testing kit from Superdrug. Soon there are Sweeney Todd-like scenes at my kitchen table as I try to produce enough blood from a series of pinpricks to fill a vial. “Babes, you’ve got to milk your finger!” shouts my girlfriend as she tries to scoop blood into the plastic tube. I’ve always been told my bald head, monstrous body hair and speedy facial hair growth are classic signs of high testosterone. I send off the sample relatively confident I don’t have any of the symptoms associated with low-T.While I wait for the results, I try to find out if there’s any actual scientific proof behind the fears that we’re not getting enough testosterone. I speak to Rebecca M Jordan-Young, a sociomedical scientist at Barnard College, Columbia University, and co-author of the forthcoming book, Testosterone: an Unauthorised Biography. I am not surprised when she tells me that much of the received wisdom about testosterone is nonsense.“The idea of low-T has been really pushed, but low-T in and of itself is not a problem – you can have pretty low-T and be getting an awful lot out of that,” she says. “The average man has so much more testosterone than is needed for sexual functioning. In placebo-controlled, randomised trials, when they start with healthy people who have no complaints… most trials find no difference in any aspect of mood or cognition or behaviour even at massively high levels of testosterone.”Jordan-Young says that hormones are extremely complex. The idea that ingesting more oestrogen from soy means you have less testosterone is a complete misunderstanding of how hormones work. Indeed, testosterone is often converted into oestrogen, which means that people who routinely inject testosterone often end up growing breasts.Other research has shown that some testosterone treatments, especially those self-administered without regular medical checks, may make men more prone to heart attacks and prostate cancer. Boosting testosterone can also make a man infertile. Jordan-Young says the reason for much of this confusion comes from the misconception that testosterone is “the male sex hormone”.“Hormones were originally discovered within a research programme that was already set up to characterise them as about masculinity and femininity. It was originally thought that when they did find the ‘male essence’ it would only be found in male bodies, that it would be detrimental to female bodies and that it would be exclusively about sex-related functions. None of those things turned out to be true, but all of them lived on in our folklore.”Jordan-Young says there is little solid evidence of a testosterone decline in men. Even the claim that men have less testosterone now than they did a generation ago is doubtful. Studies are conflicting: some say there’s no decline at all a couple say there’s a small but statistically significant decline over time. But the best population-based data from the US doesn’t show any decline in men.Yet in this strange world in which endocrinology has overlapped with gender politics, the myth has spread faster than any scientific approach. Many healthy men believe they need more testosterone, not least because there are some men for whom TRT can be life-changing.Some of them are treated by Dr Richard Petty, who runs the Wellman Clinic. Petty is a fantastically posh doctor who calls his secretaries “the girls” and has an office on Harley Street as big as my flat. He began specialising in men’s health after running a private clinic in the 1970s in Chelsea. When the recession and the three-day week hit, his patients could no longer afford to live in the area – as he puts it: “They had to live in their country houses or move to Putney” – so the wives and children got new doctors in the suburbs and he kept “the chaps”.He began dealing more with prostate cancer, learning about testosterone and publishing on its importance. He’s rather more bullish than Jordan-Young about the prospects of TRT for transforming lives.I ask whether he can tell when someone comes through the door whether they have low testosterone. “Absolutely, I can see from the street. You get anaemic, you see. So they’re pale. Even if they’re brown they’re not pink. Arteries in the face are less dilated than they would be otherwise.”Petty says for a number of the patients he sees, TRT can not only perk up their sex life but lead to major improvements in mental health, lifting a depression that they have previously been unable to treat effectively.Armed with a new understanding of how testosterone works, I give Daniel Kelly a ring, hoping to convince him that men under 35 don’t need to get involved with testosterone boosting. He’s jollier than I expected, although occasionally says things like: “Society is trying to pigeonhole men almost into behaving like women.”He explains that he now injects testosterone directly twice a week and plans to do so for the rest of his life. He did have quite low testosterone levels to begin with, but says he’s not concerned simply about remedying low testosterone, but having an optimum level.I explain what Jordan-Young has said, that optimum testosterone isn’t real and your body can do a lot with a little T, and Kelly groans. “Mainstream doctors think it’s fine, as long as the hormones are in an arbitrary range made up by someone in an ivory tower who doesn’t understand it. It’s an arbitrary reference range that they made up. There’s a big difference between normal health and optimal health. It’s going to take some balancing, but what’s the alternative: feel like crap because you’re in some arbitrary reference range?”He quotes studies at me that refute the link between testosterone and prostate cancer. He says over-the-counter hormone boosters can be dangerous, but he only advocates prescription TRT that “shrinks your balls” and gives you acne, and otherwise he believes “there are no risks”.He accepts that some people don’t need TRT and it should be a last resort after changes to diet, getting fit and giving up booze. Yet he still believes many men – not just men with severe symptoms, or men who doctors believe have dangerously low-T – would be happier if they increased their T-levels artificially, even though it means they’ll have to do so for the rest of their lives. “Low testosterone makes men more meek and lacking in confidence, and the honest truth is if you walk down the street most men won’t even give you a strong handshake.”As so often happens when science and politics collide, there are some slivers of truth hidden beneath a lot of nonsense. Testosterone can be transformative for those lacking it. But the idea that any kind of crisis of masculinity has been caused by lower testosterone in the population is a fiction, wished into existence by those peddling right-wing pseudoscience.Or so I had convinced myself, right up until my T results land in my inbox. I’m shocked. I’m in the one-star petrol category, with a score my “Superdrug doctor” describes as “within the normal range, but at the lower end”. Despite not experiencing any of the associated problems with low testosterone, I honestly feel ashamed of my T-score. My logical brain might know I shouldn’t be worried, but I find myself flicking back through Kelly’s book, looking for advice. Maybe I do struggle to concentrate. Who doesn’t feel a bit lethargic sometimes? If testosterone insecurity has been manufactured out of nowhere over the past decade, it’s certainly working on me. Superdrug says I should do a second test to make sure of the result. I immediately start Googling to find a company that will give me a second opinion – and hopefully a better result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a9518c36b0e675214e0112082d7f75ba55d07f/0_223_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=419af89e1be778f06b2cdd2f6ddc5690","title":"a controlling woman in our lives is turning my girlfriend against me","story":"The best way to react is to do absolutely nothing, says Mariella FrostrupThe dilemma My girlfriend and I have been together for four years. A year ago we moved from London to a smaller city where we met a woman in a bar who seemed eager to become friends. As time went on it became apparent that she often lures men and women in relationships to have sex. It wasn’t long before she made advances towards me, which I rejected. Since then she has turned nasty and ignores me. She is also verbally toxic towards others. My girlfriend has suffered from mental illness and struggles with guilt and shame. This means she has issues saying no to people. The woman has her buying her dinner and sharing information about our relationship – mainly to do with sex. She puts pressure on her to catch up many times a week. I’m trying to be supportive, but my girlfriend defends her and is sceptical of her coming on to me, saying I miss the attention. It feels as if she’s been reeled in and can’t see her behaviour is causing an issue. I’m starting to feel like a ranting boyfriend, which is making it worse.Mariella replies Understandable. The annoying thing about partners is that all too often they completely disregard our opinions about friends and family. You’d think that sharing someone’s bed and life would put you in pole position to dictate, or at least influence, their choices, but when push comes to shove, all they plough is their own flawed furrow. I can feel your pain, but unfortunately there’s little I can do to assuage it.This woman sounds like the sort of person fiction is inspired by – writers like Iris Murdoch would have a field day with her untrammelled determination to take what she wants and leave broken hearts and abandoned suitors in her wake. She’s certainly managed to get you hot under the collar and it does raise the question, did she once have you too under her spell? As you describe her she certainly lacks any appealing qualities.That said, controlling our lovers is not an option, so when they choose to take a different path our choices are limited, and often we can only stand by and wait to say: “I told you so.” I don’t know this woman so I can’t judge her simply on what you say, although I’ve met many who mirror the elements that you describe. No doubt she’s a consummate seducer and the more you battle against her influence, the harder she’ll try to compete with you.In such circumstances, unless you have weapons of mass destruction at your disposal, or are prepared to invest the time to embark on all-out psychological warfare, the best way to react is to do absolutely nothing. Feigning lack of interest is your most powerful tool and will stop you squandering vast amounts of time on situations in which you are likely to have little impact. You’ve spent four years with this partner of yours so if she’s still inclined to disregard your misgivings, you have little choice but to leave her to it.Sometimes it’s worth considering the worst case scenario because once we have that in our minds, there’s little power left to those who are causing us upset. In this instance either you imagine your girlfriend is going to be seduced, has already been seduced or may in some other way be influenced against you. Your girlfriend’s mental health issues may make her easy prey, but they also shouldn’t be used by you as ammunition against her ability to choose her friendships. The two matters are entirely separate.If you consider your girlfriend to be so susceptible to the influence of others that it’s cause for worry, encouraging her to visit a therapist and resolve those vulnerabilities would be more supportive behaviour than railing against her feelings for a particular pal. Much of what this woman gets up to is entirely within the bounds of acceptable behaviour and pejorative terms like “reeling in” only serve to make you seem predisposed against her for enjoying a vibrant and varied sex life.That doesn’t mean I’m not sympathetic to your feelings, but you’ve written to me because I’m also entirely emotionally removed from the situation, which naturally affects my view. I’d say this woman has struck you where you are most vulnerable and is managing to play on your insecurities by maintaining her close proximity to your girlfriend. The only way to change any relationship dynamic, whether friendship, romantic, business or family, is not to try to alter others but modify or attempt different behaviour yourself.If I were in your shoes, I’d be looking for an active form of displacement activity, with friends whose company you enjoy that would not only keep you distracted but might actually entirely obscure this woman’s presence in your sphere. If you can’t change her, or your girlfriend’s commitment to her, you can certainly change your own response to that dynamic. Expending energy trying to exert control over situations that we have little chance of achieving success in is not a sensible or productive use of our short tenure in this world. Let go and you may be surprised how quickly she boomerangs back. If she doesn’t, perhaps you have less in common than you previously imagined."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8fa861e577d1597bfd5be6d3c7241a256c0d809/1204_935_4488_2693/master/4488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=533f4ad7c5535bbe243326abe3966fad","title":"five ways to have a stress free morning","story":"Do what you can the night before, avoid gadgets – and don’t hit the snooze buttonPrepare what you can the night before, says Dr Hazel Wallace, a locum doctor and the author of The Food Medic – from your packed lunch to laying out your clothes. Vicky Silverthorn, a professional organiser, suggests leaving necessary items by the front door, or using sticky notes as reminders. Checking the weather forecast, keeping your calendar up to date and taking care of any time-intensive grooming routines the night before will also help you feel more prepared.Dr Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley, advises against hitting the snooze button, as it disrupts uninterrupted, quality sleep instead he suggests setting your alarm for when you actually need to wake up. The Sleep Council, which promotes healthy sleep habits, warns that your body experiences a spike in cortisol every time your alarm goes off. If you struggle not to press the button, leave the alarm across the room, so you have to walk over to silence it. You could also try one that eases you awake with light or vibrations.Silverthorn advocates getting into a routine of placing your keys and other essential items in the same place each time you get in, be it on a hook or in a tray or a drawer: “Have a home for everything.” Decluttering your home can also lead to a more streamlined routine. “The less you have, the easier it is to be in charge of your home, rather than it being in charge of you.”Wallace makes overnight oats most evenings and takes them with her to work the next day. Silverthorn says it is useful to have systems in place, such as checklists or a tea and coffee station in the kitchen, but she warns against anything complicated, as it has less chance of sticking long-term. If your children are old enough to make their own breakfast, leave bowls and food within their reach, to encourage independence. “The kitchen is the hub of the home. If that’s in the right place, as it were, then everything runs more smoothly,” she says.Many of us make the mistake of reaching for our phones first thing. Instead, Silverthorn encourages starting the day with at least five minutes away from gadgets, perhaps spent making a cup of tea and sitting down to drink it in peace. “That is vital for me every morning. It’s five minutes to get your head together. You can say it’s hard, but five minutes is doable.” The daily commute can also be made less stressful with a few tweaks, says Wallace. Check for delays, leave in plenty of time, wear comfortable shoes and have a book or a podcast ready for your journey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bec279d175e63b01d471a9ffdd57c8a156927f04/49_0_2383_1430/master/2383.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fa525c5a1d49c2e2c2787afb611a19d","title":"san francisco runner artwork frida strava","story":"Lenny Maughan has been turning his routes into art, choosing paths that when viewed on a map form illustrations Crafting a running route is a delicate process, especially in a city like San Francisco: you’ve got to find somewhere safe and scenic, avoid the crowds and decide how many hills you want to conquer.

But as route-tracking apps became popular, runners began to notice images in their pathways, “kind of like a Rorschach test”, he told the . The immediate impulse among many runners was, inevitably, to draw penises: “That’s where it all began,” he said. “But I wanted to do something different and something original.”Indeed, creating Frida Kahlo required a 28.9-mile run. Maughan tracks his paths using the running app Strava, which means you, too, can run in the shape of the celebrated Mexican artist’s face. If you’re as fit as Maughan, it will take you six hours and eight minutes.The tracking process is high-tech, but the whole thing starts with just a pen and paper. “When I was a kid everyone thought I’d be an artist when I grew up – I was always drawing things,” he said. He was a particular fan of the Etch-a-Sketch, which has something in common with his current work: both require creating images in an unbroken line.Maughan has lived in San Francisco for more than 20 years, and many of his images happen to have a connection to the region. He has run in the shape of California the Grateful Dead guitarist’s Jerry Garcia’s hand, missing part of the middle finger and a firefighter’s helmet and axe, to honor first responders amid wildfires.But such local links are just coincidental, he said. His goal is to create images anyone can recognize: “This is just a way to make the streets my own.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73209cd53e365aa97c65e4b029782d5c7e0f28e7/0_332_5079_3048/master/5079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7feb07c2d232739225074c5c84248526","title":"gardens contest could help tap into tourist demand say mps","story":"Committee says scheme similar to city of culture could raise profile of garden tourismA competition to crown the best UK cities for gardens could boost the economy through untapped tourist potential, MPs have suggested.Similar to the UK City of Culture initiative, such a scheme could raise the profile of garden tourism, according to a report by the digital, culture, media and sport committee.The MPs referred to a report last year that said tourism spending attributable to parks and gardens came to about £2.9bn in 2017 and quoted the National Garden Scheme which has argued that the benefits of the sector are underestimated.Research for MPs’ report was gathered at the first select committee evidence session held at the Chelsea flower show in May, when MPs asked representatives from the National Trust, Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, Royal Horticultural Society, Royal Parks and VisitBritain to find out what more support the government could provide to the industry.Damian Collins, the committee’s chairman, said: “Britain’s gardens are part of what makes Britain great. It’s time for the garden design and tourism industries to be properly recognised for the significant contribution they make to our economy. It was clear from the evidence that there is so much potential here that needs to be tapped in to.“That’s why in this report we’re calling for the government to create a UK garden city competition, give a boost to the marketing for gardens and better track the sector’s contribution to the economy.”The committee recommends that a taskforce, including representatives from VisitBritain and the gardening sector, should meet before the end of the year to look at better coordination of garden tourism marketing activity.It adds that garden design should be recognised as part of the UK’s creative sector and says the sector’s contribution to the economy should be tracked in official department estimates in order to provide a solid evidence base for garden tourism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbaf90e94e803c54d646f040c2661f0ebc2e04bd/0_312_5112_3068/master/5112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3edb2967aa42b941d59e8907d0c8e6","title":"the tiger who came to tea tv christmas judith kerr","story":"David Oyelowo to star in animated version of Judith Kerr children’s classicThe Tiger Who Came to Tea, the classic children’s book by Judith Kerr which has enchanted generations of readers, will come to TV this Christmas as a half-hour animated film on Channel 4, featuring the voices of Benedict Cumberbatch, David Oyelowo and Tamsin Greig.They will be joined by David Walliams and Paul Whitehouse, and the role of Sophie will be taken by seven-year-old Clara Ross, who will make her TV debut.

The book is a thing of beauty – there isn’t a word out of place, the illustrations are just gorgeous.“I really wanted to be a part of it and I was chuffed that she wanted me to narrate.

So why did their drummer just quit the band?By now, we know reunion culture is a con. The brief excitement of seeing a favourite band re-form is swiftly tempered by watching them resentfully trot out the hits and confront their mortality. Plus, the past is no longer a novelty but our perpetual groundhog day of recycled franchises and rebooted brands.Which is why Sleater-Kinney’s surprise return, in 2015, nine years after they went on hiatus, was so refreshing. Not content to rehash old glories, the feminist punks had a brilliant new album, the riotous, new wavy No Cities to Love, and singer-guitarists Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker and drummer Janet Weiss were unabashedly vocal about ending the dearth of fortysomething women in rock.Even better, it turned out not to be a one-off. This January, news that St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, had produced their new album “broke the internet”, said US indie bible Pitchfork, sounding slightly awed by the “endless possibilities of what this collaboration might sound like”. “Endless possibilities” was on the money: The Center Won’t Hold is Sleater-Kinney’s most erse album, bursting with vaudevillian romps about how women are naturals at handling chaos, industrial demands for carnal and spiritual satisfaction, Tom Petty-indebted balladry couching admissions of betrayal and rousing choruses made to yell at last orders.In mid-June, I am due to meet the trio to discuss their second second coming over lunch in Portland, Oregon, but I get an email hours beforehand saying Weiss is ill. Tucker arrives at the neighbourhood spot first, her striped earrings matching her monochrome T-shirt. It’s a shame about Weiss, I say. “Yeah,” Tucker says with a sigh, looking at the sky. “It is.” Brownstein appears, tiny and shaggily glam in a grey felted jacket. We head into the restaurant, which is straight out of Portlandia, the now concluded Emmy-winning satire of life in the zealously artisanal city that Brownstein wrote and starred in. She orders fish stew, while Tucker orders cornbread and asks the waiter what their “zero food print” certification means. It’s a programme funding climate-friendly farming, we learn, as Michael Jackson plays over the stereo.They laugh at the ethical absurdity. Tucker and Brownstein are Sleater-Kinney’s songwriters and their 25-year friendship is seductive. They’re as goofy as they are deferential, less serious than you might imagine – Brownstein’s grin occupies half her face and Tucker frequently detonates an explosive laugh. This new album is a bit of a fluke, they explain. Last spring, Brownstein was developing an adaptation of her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl for TV, a potential post-Portlandia project. The lightly fictionalised show would trace her and Tucker’s search for a drummer in Olympia, Washington, where they met as students who moved to the city to join the early 90s riot grrrl scene.Back then, in real life, the pair flew to Melbourne to meet their first drummer without hearing a beat of her playing. They made two albums with Laura Macfarlane, until the geographical logistics became annoying. Then they found Weiss, who was “the best decision we ever made”, Brownstein wrote in her memoir. Weiss joined for their third (and first great) album, 1997’s poppy, punchy Dig Me Out. They eclipsed the DIY Olympia scene and became one of America’s most innovative rock bands, subverting girl-group convention and classic rock excess, while Tucker’s astonishing gospel wail gave their work a powerful spiritual urgency. Once fans found out that Tucker and Brownstein had briefly dated, they became queer icons of a sort, too.Brownstein’s pilot for the show about their early days wasn’t picked up. But if it had succeeded, she says, who knows when they would have had time to make a new album. “I was like, why am I examining music through a historical lens? My relationship to music is right now. That’s more important to me.”That relationship was reinvigorated when they saw young people who missed them first time at their incendiary reunion shows. I went to five of those to make up for lost time aged 16, I’d bought their single Jumpers on sight. It was on green vinyl and the credits billed three women, which was enough of a USP in the laddy 00s. I was too late – it turned out to be their last single.Brownstein recently started to think the bar around their 2015 comeback was too low. “There’s this leeway: oh, it’s not terrible! And it was nothing even close to terrible, but you can sail on the momentum of relieved enthusiasm for a while.” Deciding to continue raises the stakes: the only point, says Tucker, is to do something different. “Wanting to play with what we’ve done before, wanting to take risks.”Taking risks can prove, well, risky. Nine days after I meet Tucker and Brownstein, Weiss quits Sleater-Kinney. “The band is heading in a new direction and it is time for me to move on,” she says in a statement. I track her down and ask if she wants to talk she considers it, but declines.Tucker and Brownstein sound crushed when we speak the day after Weiss’s news. They admit that she wasn’t unwell the day we met in Portland – this happened very recently and suddenly and they didn’t know what was going on. They tried band therapy. They won’t speculate on Weiss’s reasoning, although Brownstein says they thought “everyone was really happy about the record”.But the show will go on. Brownstein says they are as determined to evolve as ever. “After these years, it might feel harder to take those risks, but that’s what I’m invested in. Corin and I took ourselves to the opposite side of the world to start Sleater-Kinney. There’s always been something impulsive and scrappy about this band and I don’t feel there’s another way to be in it except to adapt and evolve.”Appropriately, The Center Won’t Hold takes inspiration from an unlikely source – at least for a punk band. They were driving around listening to Rihanna’s ballad Stay when Brownstein said she wanted to write a song like it. When they started writing in earnest, she was living in Los Angeles, Tucker in Portland (Brownstein later moved back), so they had to work remotely for the first time, giving them space to expand their inidual visions.Brownstein apologetically ventures a “super-psychoanalytical” theory. Tucker became a parent before Sleater-Kinney made 2002’s One Beat, one of the period’s few explicitly anti-Bush albums – Far Away depicted her breastfeeding while watching televised warfare. “Remember your awareness of being a mother and having to be protective of your kids?” Brownstein asks. “Your son is 18, he’s going to college. Not like, ‘You’re done!’, but it seems like you feel so much more freedom to express anxieties. That’s maybe harder when you’re holding so tight to notions of family.”Tucker agrees. She had worried that being a musician would mess up her kids – her second was born after the band’s 2006 break – but with one kid out the door, she feels relief. “It is really freeing to rage a bit more in my songs.”Not that she’s been sanguine in the interim – she raged loudly on the last album. Also, what about her 11-year-old daughter? “She’s raising herself,” Brownstein deadpans. Their relationships have registered the change. Now 46, Tucker says she used to be the care-giver while Brownstein, 44, was needier. (Brownstein describes Weiss, 53, as consistently “no-nonsense”.)“Carrie has really worked on being a very nurturing person,” says Tucker, with comedy largesse. “She’s very caring.”Tucker says she has become less nice, although she still insists on sharing her lunch. “I’ve raised two kids, done that, and now I’m more in touch with what I need, what I deserve.”That need rages through Broken, the bluesy piano ballad that took the Rihanna inspiration somewhere very different. It’s a tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her in 1982. “She stood up for us when she testified me, me too,” Tucker sings, ruefully: “My body cried out when she spoke those lines.”Kavanaugh was appointed anyway. But one outcome, says Tucker, was positive. “To say ‘me too’ means this matters, that you have ownership over what happened to you. It’s OK to say it impacted your life at any age. Men lost their jobs. That’s a big deal. Harvey Weinstein walking to court in handcuffs – that’s a win.” Still: “It’s not enough and the legal part is mind-numbingly slow to change.”Meanwhile, the backlash is swift. “Straight, white men are in a state of disinheritance from positions of power that they assumed were their inalienable right,” says Brownstein, who gets academic when drawn on intellectual topics. “When you have so many people fearful of losing power, what they do to keep it is the brutality we’re living in. Take anti-abortion legislation – there’s such pushback when there is progress. It is not inevitable.” She sighs. “Those reminders are very desolate.”But Broken aside, The Center Won’t Hold isn’t explicitly political. “If people thought Sleater-Kinney was gonna put out some loud, anti-Trump record, they would be misguided,” says Brownstein. The restaurant has closed, so we perch outside. Sleater-Kinney have already written those songs, she laughs. “We’ve been addressing the #MeToo movement and shitty patriarchal systems of injustice and subjugation since 1995!”If anything, Trump’s presidency has forced a reconsideration of what makes art “political”. Performing rage was the preserve of punk. Now it’s mainstream discourse. “It’s really hard to want to match that level of hyperbole,” says Brownstein. “Even though I appreciate the spirit of anger, that volume has been claimed by some really terrible people.” Made by four women, the album is inherently “its own political statement”, she says. Tucker brings up Hillary Clinton: “This squashing of older women is such a part of our patriarchal culture, but it got turned up. We thought, let’s not mellow out at all, let’s take our music and see how much we can expand it, change it.”Hang on – from singing about rape culture in 1995 to the violence of capitalism on No Cities to Love, Sleater-Kinney have never been mellow. Brownstein half-agrees: “That was the whole creed we came out of – 90s punk-rock feminism – but the older you get, the scarier it is to actually say you still want to be doing this because there are fewer stories in popular music by women of a certain age. Doing that when we were younger was almost taken for granted. Now you actually have to grab for it, be a little bit greedy and voracious.”Expansive and adventurous, The Center Won’t Hold makes that statement boldly. There’s also the matter of Brownstein’s bare bum being on the cover of single Hurry on Home. She had wanted the whole band to be naked. “That was a bad idea!” Brownstein admits.Tucker – and her daughter – agreed. “I was reading her texts aloud and she was like, ‘MOM! You’re not DOING THAT!’”They cackle. They say they were too shy to celebrate their sexuality in their 20s. Brownstein claims someone once wrote an angry dissertation about a photo where her pants were visible. Plus, says Tucker, “music has always been the playground of men’s sexuality. Women have really struggled to claim their own space.” (That’s also why they think #MeToo has barely touched the music industry.)Sexual empowerment is in a state of hyper-evolution: now it would be the writer decrying Brownstein’s knickers who would be considered a traitor. “Gender as a construct is now like a mesh bag,” says Tucker, with relief. “It used to be so rigid,” says Brownstein. “The queering of the culture and the deconstruction of gender identity has freed up a lot of things for women.” She thinks her queerness challenges the idea that middle age is a sexual wasteland.It’s all in the album’s best lyric: “There’s nothing more frightening and nothing more obscene than a well-worn body demanding to be seen,” Brownstein yelps on the euphoric Love, a love letter written by Sleater-Kinney to themselves, and to resistance through collaboration. It sounds a bit different now that Weiss has left – rallying cry turned eulogy.When Weiss quit, it added to a wave of growing scepticism among the band’s hardcore fans who, it turned out, don’t really want Sleater-Kinney to change. They criticised the band’s new singles, saying that Clark’s production made them sound too much like St Vincent. They criticised Brownstein for having her bum out, concluding that she and Clark (who she once dated) must be trying to dominate the band. They accused the band of selling out for leaving indie label Sub Pop for indie label Mom + Pop. Weiss leaving was taken as proof of all this. In the comments beneath her departing statement, people called Clark “Yoko Ono”.It’s been strange to watch – indicative of a pretty limited imagination about female collaboration and ambition. Perhaps you can understand why fans would want a reliable constant during a period of political chaos that has shown, as Brownstein has said, that progress is not inevitable. And when someone leaves a totemic feminist band – ideally a crucible of shared politics – people inevitably question how they can believe in their mission if one of their members apparently didn’t. Scarier, perhaps, is the senseless way that old friendships can just end.But the criticism was misplaced. It had, in fact, been Weiss’s idea to work with Clark, who says she felt no fear about pushing Sleater-Kinney even though she was once a teenage worshipper of the band, whose posters were on her bedroom wall. After their 2006 farewell gig in New York, Clark she was “so amped up that I kicked over a newsstand in excitement”. “Now,” she thinks, “there’s a lot of ways to move people’s hearts and make them wanna kick things over and scream.”The group abandoned their original plan to work with multiple producers after their trial week with Clark in Los Angeles really took off. After that, Weiss didn’t return until the last two days of recording. She was busy, Brownstein laments in Portland. (Weiss works as a film and TV location manager, a career that started on Brownstein’s Portlandia.) There is a personal cost of being in a band, especially when each member has a very different economic reality: Brownstein a celebrity, Tucker a working mum, Weiss developing a new career.Those disparities inevitably affect what Sleater-Kinney means to everybody. “It’s tricky when it’s not the life raft you’re all on,” Brownstein says, sadly. “Not that the band needs to be a life raft the same way it might have in 1997, but it requires an urgency mixed with joy and appreciation from each of us. If it’s not there equally, it can be really hard.”As for fans’ scepticism, this wasn’t new. In 1997, Sleater-Kinney were accused of selling out when they left tiny queercore label Chainsaw for almost-as-tiny Kill Rock Stars. “From the beginning, people have knocked our ideas of ambition,” says Tucker. The point of changing label, producer and sound was change itself. “I just don’t have that relationship to what we do where I think, if we do the same thing, people will love us,” says Brownstein. “Then you’re making work by consensus, which is the worst way to make art. It lacks a point of view.” She’s steadfast: “Corin and I feel very confident that whatever we’re doing in Sleater-Kinney is Sleater-Kinney.”Weiss’s departure will affect how people hear The Center Won’t Hold. But practically speaking, Tucker and Brownstein write the songs. In our bleak postmortem interview, Brownstein shows a flash of optimism. “Corin and I started this band and we’ll end it. It was a long and really special journey with Janet, but there’s also something about it being Corin and I that feels familiar and very normal.”Tucker lights up. “I’m not going anywhere!”Brownstein laughs. “Thanks for letting me know.”They say the split isn’t acrimonious – just bad timing from someone famed for good timing. “We want Janet to be happy and healthy,” says Tucker. “If someone’s not happy doing that job, it wouldn’t be good for any of us.” And so this summer, Sleater-Kinney will be back searching for a drummer to help them smash through new ground: just the same but brand new.The Center Won’t Hold is released by Mom + Pop on 16 August. The band play London, Manchester and Glasgow in February 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57d71d4b52c3477bcde069d48db1dc124963f4b2/0_28_898_539/master/898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d110f3cef16fb5f4dd2d987b69c6d7cd","title":"deliciously ella names baby in tribute to late mother in law tessa jowell","story":"Food blogger announces birth of daughter Skye Tessa Camilla Davan Mills on InstagramThe food blogger Ella Mills, known as Deliciously Ella, has paid tribute to her late mother-in-law, Dame Tessa Jowell, by naming her newborn daughter after her.Mills, 28, told her 1.6 million Instagram followers that she and her husband, Matthew, had named their first child, who was born on Saturday, Skye Tessa Camilla Davan Mills.She posted a photograph showing the couple with their baby, and wrote: “Born in the pool at home yesterday afternoon.

It was set up in 2016 to develop a new way of measuring poverty.The finding echoes wider concerns about the re-emergence of extreme poverty, known as destitution, which separate research has shown was experienced by an estimated 1.5 million people in the UK as a result of benefits cuts and high rents. A destitution level of income is £140 a week for a couple with two children.Although overall rates of poverty have changed relatively little since 2000-01, certain groups – such as children, children of lone parents, and pensioners – have had hardship levels rise since 2013 as a result of austerity measures such as the benefit freeze, reversing earlier downward trends, the commission said.The commission’s report confirms that disability is one of the strongest predictors of being in poverty. Nearly half of all those living below the breadline live in a household where someone is disabled.Since the commission published its first report last year, the government has announced it will develop experimental national statistics based on its approach, indicating possible adoption as an official poverty measure. Its data was used by the UN rapporteur, Philip Alston, in his recent UK poverty report.A government spokesperson said: “Tackling poverty will always be a priority for this government. We want to build on our progress to ensure every family can thrive. That’s why we’ve raised the personal allowance to take 1.74 million of the lowest paid out of income tax altogether and increased the national living wage to provide the biggest pay rise for low-paid workers in 20 years.”Helen Barnard, a commission member and poverty expert at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “We need our new prime minister to get to work immediately on a bold plan to boost living standards and support our towns and cities in building a more hopeful economic future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/339834a289e988a1226e3de042d3b2da620c2d4b/0_62_2472_1483/master/2472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad4dfefae10d53b6f3986f586e7571cd","title":"australia pat cummins england ashes interview","story":"Australia paceman, after years of injury, is determined to make the most of this Ashes series and believes the conditions will suit himMost people in cricket know the Pat Cummins story. The teen prodigy, man of the match in his first Test aged 18, bowling like the wind to smash through South Africa before his vital runs sealed an absurd victory chase. Six years in purgatory, injury after injury limiting him to the odd white-ball match and the physio room. Then the comeback that has made him the No 1 Test bowler in the world and winner of the Allan Border medal for Australia’s male cricketer of the year.Cummins the person is as compelling. A bowler who seethes with pace but also shows a mastery of seam movement and aggressive lines. A refusal to give in, the kind who forces a wicket when batsmen are on top. A hard striker of the ball with a classical technique and patience for days. A dash of matinee idol: tall, straight, with a high-beam smile. A courteous manner with everyone he meets. None of the nuggety, sunburned grumpiness of Australian cricket cliche.What is also clear from Cummins is his sense of perspective: more deliberate and relaxed than some of his forebears. After the lost World Cup semi-final? “I went and lay by the beach in France,” he tells the . “I deliberately chose that when I was looking for places. Somewhere no one speaks English and no one knows what cricket is. I try and grab every chance I can to switch off, especially on a long tour. A couple of days away feels like a week.”He was philosophical about that game: disappointed to fall so close, proud of progress from the shambles of a few months earlier. Not that he was shrugging at the silverware. Plenty of people forget Cummins played in Australia’s winning 2015 campaign, though he never will.“Just about my career highlight,” he says. “It was a tournament where I felt lucky to be in that 15, I was there and thereabouts in the ODI team the entire time but never felt like I’d cemented a spot. It’s a once-in-a-career opportunity to play a World Cup at home, I was 21 and right in the mixer.”But it’s the Ashes that really have his attention, where he thinks Australia have a better chance to compete. And it was another 2015 tour, when he reprised his fringe role in that year’s Ashes, that he thinks can help him.“I don’t think I’d ever bowled with a Dukes ball before,” he says. “It’s a great environment to learn, and to see guys like Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in their home conditions go about their work, see how Aussie guys deal with the pressure of an away series, being right there in the middle of it without having the stresses of playing. I feel like I’m better equipped for this time around.”On that tour and in this year’s World Cup, English conditions agreed with him. “There always seems to be sideways movement and the Dukes ball, even if it goes soft, still has a bit of swing. It’s not 40 degrees so you can run in all day. It feels like if you put into the wicket you’re going to get something out of it. It levels the contest sometimes as opposed to a flat day-three or day-four wicket in Australia or a flat ODI wicket, sometimes you go into defence mode. Over here you can always sense a wicket coming.”Cummins had more injury delays after 2015 and it was a flat wicket when he first returned to Tests for Australia’s 2017 draw in Ranchi. But he immediately showed what cricket had been missing by whistling down bouncers at the helmets of India’s batsmen, bowling with proper pace on the somnolent track.For the rest of that year each Cummins spell was heart in mouth. When would he break down again? But he played twice in India, then all five Ashes Tests, then four in South Africa. “The physios and doctors always told me this is normal, once you get a couple more years of cricket you’ll get a good run. It’s hard to believe until you get there.” His body has been repaying those lost years since.There was no sterner test than Johannesburg 2018, Cummins flying the flag all but alone while Australia were demolished after the sandpaper storm. One impressed observer was the South Africa captain, Faf du Plessis. “We would sit on the side of the field and just admire what he does. We’d say, ‘Look at the guy, he’s still running in and bowling quick.’ Diving at balls when he’s just finished an eight-over spell, runs in the series. As a batter I definitely felt he was the biggest challenge. He’s a nice guy, Pat. You enjoy it when nice guys do well, even opposition, the good people of the game.”Even England supporters may have to like him. His cricket wins respect, his conduct wins regard. In Johannesburg last year he was one of the first to speak plainly of Australia’s sledging: “If we talk about abuse it’s certainly over the line and that’s not pure emotion, that’s pre-planned bullying sometimes, and we’ve all been guilty of that.”Now he says that “sport’s quite emotional and there will definitely be times on the field when those emotions show through, but it’s about trying to manage how we show them”.Perhaps his years on the sidelines have helped Cummins be a bit more objective, in the same way that emergency captain Tim Paine’s own years in the injury wilderness made him enough of an outsider to be a credible reformer of team and culture.“It’s probably the first time where we’ve really had to sit back and think about how we wanted to play,” Cummins says of the start of Paine’s tenure. “For me personally, going to university or having a few pre-seasons trying to recover from injury, it’s just knowing that you can’t judge yourself on purely cricket, because if you do then you’re forever riding this rollercoaster. Definitely taking a step back gives you time to actually think.”Do not mistake any of that for going easy, though. “The way I’ve always played is to get into the fight,” he says. “This is a side that’s really hungry, many of them in their first Ashes, their first away Test. For me it’s about remembering what I did well last time against England, try to adjust to English conditions, but I just want to really make a mark. It doesn’t get much bigger for a Test player than an Ashes, and you never know if it’s going to be your last. So make the most of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a97b2c37971952b0efb6275185d4627194782ba/0_271_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c48d2a29d3eb873e91f050821670ed09","title":"creating the integrated future of english cricket in east london","story":"The ersity of Eoin Morgan’s World Cup winners has provided a platform the ECB wants to build onOn a field in east London where WG Grace notched a century in 1898, Riswan Bishar, a mobile phone shop owner originally from Islamabad, watched his son take part in a fast-developing national programme to try to use cricket to boost social and ethnic integration.Dashing after balls on Leyton cricket ground, Izaan, nine, was joined by Ongon, eight, wearing a Bangladesh cap, Orson, a nine-year old white boy in an India shirt and half a dozen others as they were put through their paces by coach Ray Tudor, a former Surrey fast bowler whose own heroes came from the fearsome West Indies team of the 1980s.The scene was a long way from the isive rhetoric of Norman Tebbit, who in 1990 when MP for neighbouring Chingford created the “cricket test” asking: “Which side do they cheer for?” and suggesting migrants who did not support England were “harking back to where you came from”.England’s win this month at the cricket World Cup, featuring leg-spinner Adil Rashid, whose parents emigrated from Pakistan, Barbados-born fast bowler Jofra Archer and Irish captain Eoin Morgan, has given the campaigns a bigger platform. The Ashes Test series against Australia offers another chance to promote the country’s level playing fields as a place for people to come together without prejudice. When Morgan said “Allah was with us” after England’s narrow victory in the World Cup final, Bishar was among those moved. “It was quite emotional for me to hear that,” he said.As he watched the boys play at Leyton, he reflected: “They will be comfortable being mixed. That’s the efforts clubs should make – make sure it is mixed. Integration is what we need now. We had the latest stabbing last week. If they were playing cricket and were in this group, they would never think about stabbing someone.”The ECB wants more south Asian players from places such as Leyton to break through into the professional game and is ploughing resources into better facilities, including more than 100 artificial pitches. Alongside the council, it has built a new indoor cricket school in Leyton.There has been a gulf in facilities, as shown by the recent emergence of an midnight to 4am league in an local Asda car park using trollies for stumps. The ECB is also targeting Asian players in Birmingham, Bradford and Leicester and over the next year has said it will consider how to encourage harder-to-reach black players into the game.“We need to capitalise on the fact Jofra is quickly becoming a role model,” said Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the ECB.Local leaders in Waltham Forest trying to prevent gang criminality and violent extremism are also pinning their hopes on cricket. The area has been beset by knife crime including a triple stabbing in April and the killing of Jaden Moodie in January. The council is considering week-long residential courses for 11 to 14-year-olds, funded by the government as part of community integration pilot schemes also happening in Peterborough, Bradford, Walsall and Blackburn.“We believe sport transcends religious boundaries, ethnicities and beliefs,” said Ahsan Khan, the Waltham Forest cabinet member for community safety, who is steering the £2m two-year pilot. “It’s a place where people come together across communities and class.”Yet many hurdles remain to greater integration in a game still perceived as elitist and expensive. South Asian cricketers often remain loyal to their own leagues, which they formed in an era of greater exclusion. More than 100 teams compete in Asian leagues in London such as the Gujarati politan Cricket League, but to rise to county level often means leaving.Efforts to persuade deprived black youths to play have also amounted to little, partly because of the competing allure of football and athletics, coaches said.“There are no black kids here,” said Tudor, who is himself black. “Football and cricket are getting exposed a lot. Cricket used to be free. Now it’s on Sky. They are thinking, who are the role models? Mine were the West Indies team and Gladstone Small, Devon Malcolm, Phillip DeFreitas,” black England bowlers of the 1980s and 90s.It is a missed opportunity for people of different backgrounds to play together in a game that offers time to observe and understand one another and thrives on differences between people to create balanced teams.The drinking culture after cricket matches can also isolate non-drinking team-mates, as was seen by Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali quickly getting out of England’s champagne-spraying group photo after winning the World Cup. At club level, non-drinking Asian players sometimes leave quickly after games when jugs of beer are produced.“It’s about ensuring that the relationship on the sports field carries on off the sports field,” said Arfan Akram, the Essex county cricket coach responsible for the amateur game in east London. “They might take it in turns about whether they go to the pub or a cafe after a match.”The ECB is also considering ways to make watching big matches more family friendly. Harrison said plans are being considered for lower-alcohol beer, specific drinking zones and entertainment programmes geared to children, to create an atmosphere that doesn’t feel like the last few hours of a drinking session.“There aren’t too many ways we can start building integration and cricket cuts through a lot of the noise and political backdrop,” said Harrison. “It comes down to a battle between bat and ball.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc44e84fabb50dca1b7fc78c94c60a49027a2e5c/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fca1e217855088afc83e85128c6b5624","title":"swimming australia face heat over handling of shayna jack doping","story":"The heat may be on Swimming Australia over their handling of Shayna Jack’s doping drama but the governing body’s CEO Leigh Russell says the sprint star only has herself to blame over her positive drug test.Although Russell admits the 20-year-old may have made a simple mistake, Jack faces a ban that looks set to shatter her Tokyo Olympics dream after revealing on social media on Sunday that her B sample had tested positive.Jack says she will fight to clear her name.Russell conceded Jack may have simply slipped up and ingested something without fully knowing its contents. But the SA CEO had no sympathy for the member of Australia’s world record breaking 4x100m freestyle relay team.“It stands to reason that from time to time you are going to get people who have potentially not realised that something is on the list. But it doesn’t matter, it is their fault.”Jack may be under fire but critics have taken aim at SA after they remained silent when the sprinter was told her A sample had tested positive to a non-steroid anabolic agent popular with bodybuilders – Ligandrol – on 12 July.She was sent home the same day from Australia’s world titles training camp in Japan, citing “personal reasons”.It led to the awkward situation where the few SA officials who knew of Jack’s positive test could only look on silently as Olympic champion Mack Horton launched an anti-doping protest at the world titles in South Korea, completely oblivious of the fact his former teammate had tested positive.Then eyebrows were raised when Jack revealed on Instagram on Sunday that her B sample also tested positive on 19 July, two days before the world championships started at Gwangju.Russell had only referred to an A sample when she addressed the media on Sunday to slam Jack’s positive test as “bitterly disappointing and embarrassing for the national swimming team, the sport and the country”.Russell also indicated they were still waiting on the B test. She said confidentiality required by SA’s agreement with national anti-doping body Asada did not allow them to reveal Jack’s initial A sample test.Russell said Jack had been planning to reveal the A sample positive test after the world titles ended on Sunday so it would not be a distraction for the Dolphins.But the truth came out on Saturday when media reports broke that Jack’s A sample had tested positive, creating a major distraction for the Australian team that still had two days left in their world titles campaign at Gwangju.Former Asada CEO Richard Ings led the chorus of disapproval over SA’s handling of the issue.“I hope the rules change to allow Asada and Swimming Australia to make announcements in future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2166efb9db89203023141a34da942f4001707f5a/136_579_6308_3785/master/6308.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f8943f77c28bebf4779b54c03d339c2","title":"kate valk desire an encounter with a play by kathy acker ica london","story":"As she prepares to direct an unstaged script by the late pirate queen of counterculture, theatre-maker Kate Valk recalls how they met – and how she dealt with Acker’s challenging attitude to sexKate Valk leads the way up a winding marble staircase, past video screens showing unspeakable acts of body modification, to an empty room at the top of London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts. She pulls up two red plastic chairs and sits herself down on one, her laptop open on her knees. The videos are part of an edgy multimedia tribute to Kathy Acker that sprawls across the ICA’s lower floors. Valk is here to add a final theatrical flourish, directing a previously unstaged script by the pirate queen of 70s and 80s counterculture.With its ornate cornicing and makeshift furniture, this deserted chamber could be a set for the Wooster group, the New York-based theatre ensemble to which Valk has belonged for the last four decades. Screens are everywhere in their shows, and at one moment – when trying to demonstrate the way in which she works – Valk puts her laptop down on the bare floor and starts to speak directly to it. “I can facilitate an encounter with the text,” she says. “This. Is. An. Encounter.”Though unknown to the wider world apart from through a couple of film cameos, most recently in Jonathan Demme’s The Manchurian Candidate, among Wooster Groupies, Valk is a legend. Described by one admirer as “the Meryl Streep of Downtown”, she has been a constipated, comically unco-ordinated Phedre (To You, The Birdie!), a blacked-up Brutus Jones (The Emperor Jones), a Betty Boop-ish Dr Faustus (HouseLights).Her most recent London appearance was in The Town Hall Affair at the Barbican last year, wreaking merry havoc as the radical lesbian Jill Johnston, one of the participants in a celebrated 1971 face-off between Norman Mailer and Germaine Greer. But all her attention today is on how to make sense of the late, great disruptor Acker.Though this isn’t a Wooster Group show, she has flown in with two young colleagues – another will join them later – for a collaboration with three UK-based performers, who were auditioned over Skype. The six have just three weeks to animate Desire, a mashup of dialogue, prose and stage directions, in English and French, featuring a roll call of potty-mouthed Shakespearean characters, and a walk-on for Wuthering Heights’ Heathcliff.“I didn’t pick it it picked me,” she says. “I don’t know what I’m trying to do yet, but this is a unique opportunity for me to have my moment as a director.” Then she corrects herself in the curious vocabulary of the Wooster Group, saying she is not the director but the instigator. “I like the term ‘instigating a performance’,” she says, “but, as a 62-year-old person with a lot of experience, I’m in charge of the instigation.”Desire is different, not only because it is being put together is such a short time and will run for only five performances. “It’s also exciting to me because this is not a theatre, it’s an arts organisation. So I feel at liberty to explore myself in a different way,” says Valk.Both the Wooster Group and Acker were idiosyncratic stars of the late-20th-century New York avant garde, but that doesn’t mean they inhabited the same space. Valk joined the Wooster group aged 21 in 1979, talking her way into lodgings above their theatre, The Performing Garage in SoHo, on the promise of being able to make costumes and props. A few miles away, Acker was holding court with a different sort of performance, based on her own highly sexualised persona.“There was something about her writing that was too aggressive for me,” says Valk. “I didn’t have the same relationship to sex. I wasn’t interested in taking on the male mind, getting inside it and taking it down. I’d gravitated towards a group with a woman in charge. The theatre was where I lived both in body and metaphorically.”But, on a visit to London in the late 80s, she was intrigued enough to take up an invitation to meet Acker at the Groucho club and was surprised by how “incredibly warm” she was. Maybe, she muses, “something in her writing wasn’t available to me at the time. It’s interesting to come back and confront that and to see what my way in is, because this is not just going to be an encounter with the text. I have to have a very intense encounter with Kathy Acker. That’s what the Wooster Group is all about: when we take on a project we have to investigate the whole ethos of the writer.”Does she feel afraid? “That’s the big question,” she laughs, snapping shut her laptop. “I almost said no to this, and there’s a huge risk of failure. But I only feel fear when I’m not working. As soon as I get in the space I don’t worry, because you just have to deal with what’s really happening.” And besides, she says as we head back down past the flickering screens, “this is a fabulous situation. It’s like the exhibition has done half of the dramaturgy for us.”• Desire: an encounter with a play by Kathy Acker is at the ICA theatre, London, 31 July-4 August, as part of I, I, I, I, I, I, I Kathy Acker.

Can there really be a right – or wrong – way to enjoy your favourite malt?It can often seem as if there are only two schools of thought when it comes to how you should enjoy your whisky. Some treat the drink with an almost austere reverence, insisting that it should only be taken neat or with just a touch of water – maybe, at a pinch, with an ice cube or two. Others, which in reality means most people who enjoy a tipple every now and then, are happy to mix it to taste with whatever works for them, use it as a base for a cocktail, or simply sip it from a mighty tumbler towering with ice.But is there a right way to drink whisky? It might be that you can do whatever you want with the house blend down at your local pub, but what about something more refined – in other words, what about a single malt?For the uninitiated, the distinction between a blend and a single malt is a fairly easy one to mark out. A scotch blend is simply a mixture of grain and malt whiskies from two or more distilleries. A single malt, on the other hand, is nothing more and nothing less than a whisky from a single distillery, bottled and sold as a whisky from a single distillery.But, of course, things are always a little more complicated than that. Blends are sometimes thought to be inferior to their single malt cousins, and while this is by no means a settled question, it is true that they don’t quite inspire the same scholarly devotion as single malts. So, while plenty of whisky purists may have no problem with you topping up an inexpensive blend with a yard of Coke, they’re likely to take a less charitable view of you doing the same with their favourite malt.Luckily, there is an answer to all of this.“It really just depends on what you’re looking for,” says Kirstie McCallum, senior blender at Distell International, which owns and produces Tobermory. “For me there’s a real difference between wanting to sit there and appreciate a whisky for all its flavours and complexity, and just actually wanting to sit there and enjoy a drink with friends.“If I want to appreciate all the flavours in a whisky and appreciate that maturation and the work that’s gone into it I love it with just a wee touch of water to open it up,” she says. “Then just sip it, let it rest in your mouth a bit so that you get a proper chance to take in all of the flavours. At the same time, if you’re just sitting around having a drink with your friends, do whatever you want with it.”McCallum’s refreshingly unpretentious take is rooted in her view that whisky – and that includes single malts – is on the whole a social, relaxed drink. That means there is plenty of room at the table both for those who want to contemplate their whisky – either neat or, as she prefers it, with a touch of water – and those who want to let their hair down a bit more.“I think for too long whisky has been seen as kind of standoffish,” she says. “There’s always been this view of whisky that it’s maybe a bit like how people see wine – they worry about not knowing what to ask for or about getting it wrong somehow. But whisky shouldn’t be like that at all, because it’s a drink for everybody.“We make the whisky for people to drink it, and whatever you like adding to it, as long as you enjoy it that’s how you should drink it,” says McCallum. “The great thing is that whisky is just such a versatile drink. You can do cocktails with whisky, you can do long drinks, or you can have a nice single malt with water.”With that in mind, McCallum suggests a number of tantalising options for enjoying Tobermory 12 Year Old. “I think with Tobermory being such a citrusy, caramelly, kind of sweet whisky, it mixes well with something that’s nice and light and fresh,” she says.“It works really well as a long mixed drink with lots of ice. I’d recommend trying it that way with either ginger ale or some fresh apple juice,” she says.On the cocktail front, McCallum says that the citrus and caramel notes of Tobermory 12 Year Old are particularly complemented by berry flavours – so a Scotch bramble, or perhaps a malt old fashioned with a blueberry garnish, could be well worth trying.“For me, whisky is a very personal drink,” she says. “I drink my whisky and it’s about memories of being places and being with friends – it’s not about ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’. In the end, it’s about enjoying it on your own terms – do whatever you want with it.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/103d7edb918046d27211514c4b0c8c65181c1521/77_1046_3951_2370/master/3951.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b84f7e3ec7414a27e2ddef745b420f77","title":"north carolina islands beauty outer banks dunes","story":"The remote, pristine islands of North Carolina are rich with dunes, wildlife – and the ghost of BlackbeardThere is no horizon: only the odd hint indicates what is water and what is sky. A dolphin shows its back, just for a second. A pair of oystercatchers draw two cursive Ms against the blue. Otherwise, the water of the Pamlico Sound is so still, and the silence so complete, it’s a disembodying experience. Slick cam, they call it.From his kayak, Bob Chestnut could reach down into the shallows and pluck out any number of treasures. Through the water he can see the dark ragged outline of oyster clusters, a shimmering of scallop shells and mussels pre-opened by the birds. In the summer, families come out here with long rakes to dig for clams.The Outer Banks – a narrow chain of barrier islands off the east coast of the US that separates the Atlantic from the mainland – are no secret to Southerners. Their 100-mile stretch of beach, running from Corolla in the north to Cape Lookout in the south, is a vacation magnet for families and spring breakers alike, as well as a pilgrimage for sporting types who can kite surf or land big game fish in the warm Gulf Stream waters. And while the Banks can claim no town with a population larger than 3,000, they still have a rich human history, inhabited by the Roanoke and Croatan people until the arrival of English settlers in the 1500s – not to mention the site of the Wright Brothers’ first powered flight.It’s not always this quiet in Ocracoke. The weather can be rough – Hurricane Florence blew in last year. And just because the North Carolinan island is hard to get to – three hours’ drive from Raleigh, followed by an hour’s ferry ride – it doesn’t mean people don’t try. A new passenger ferry from Cape Hatteras has recently been announced, because the queue for cars can be up to three hours in summer. But the locals don’t resent the visitors, says Chestnut. “The people we get tend to be the people who appreciate it.”Roanoke island boasts the quaint and well-heeled town of Manteo, complete with a yachting marina and Elizabethan garden. Across the Oregon Inlet – by way of a couple of epic bridges – are Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills, seaside towns with connecting shorelines stacked with stilted beach houses. Keep driving south to Hatteras island, across the newly constructed Bonner bridge, and you are rewarded with 70 miles of protected seashore. With the blessing of the islanders, the Hatteras shoreline was designated a national park in the 1930s and today its meeting of beach, marshland and maritime forest is a haven for wading birds, water mammals and more. “I’m anti-regulation in general,” says Chestnut, candidly. “But we have a better relationship with the park service than most.” Which is why on Hatteras and Ocracoke you are free to drive your 4WD vehicles across the golden sands, knowing that the nesting turtle population is well protected. And why while some come here to spot seals and harbour porpoises and snowy owls, others come to shoot ducks, or go flounder gigging – spearing flatfish in the shallow waters, a skill learned from the Native Americans who once used this place as a hunting ground.The islanders of the Outer Banks have always treasured their freedom. The waters surrounding them – known as the graveyard of the Atlantic, because their ever-shifting shoals are so perilous to shipping – were once a hideout for pirates and privateers. Edward Teach, aka Blackbeard, was killed (and then beheaded) while at anchor on Ocracoke. The island’s brewery – which makes an unexpectedly tasty oyster stout from the local catch – is named 1718, after the year of his capture.Still accessible only by boat – from Hatteras to the north, or Cedar Island to the west – Ocracoke’s past has been preserved by its remoteness. “Nobody stumbles across Ocracoke,” says Chester Lynn, whose ancestors have been here for 10 generations. “I can remember the days when you had to take three ferries to get to the mainland.” Lynn sells antiques out of every room of his single-storey family home and, as one of the older residents, still speaks with the brogue that is part of the island’s Elizabethan legacy – an accent closer to northern England than the American South.The community spirit, too, has been preserved. In the cafes and restaurants regulars talk across tables, sharing stories of their day and asking after friends. The buildings themselves are a glimpse of the island’s 1930s heyday, when it was a thriving fishing community and pilot town, helping trading ships to transfer their goods across the treacherous sounds on lighters.Back then, “Jack’s store” was the place locals gathered to collect their mail and their gossip that it’s still standing is no surprise. Make-good-and-mend is central to the island culture. Among the quirkiest results of that attitude are the tiny, walled cemetery plots where the island’s chief families have buried their relatives.“The problem has always been that the water table is so high it was hard to keep people buried,” says Amy Howard, who runs the Village Craftsmen store. “A good flood could pop up a casket.” Her family traces itself back to William Howard, Blackbeard’s quartermaster. “Luckily for him he was in jail in Virginia when the big battle happened, and he got a pardon,” she says.Some locals claim to have seen phantom pirates out at Springer’s Point, the site of Blackbeard’s last battle but visitors can have their own haunting experience with a boat ride to Portsmouth island, just a couple of miles away. Abandoned by humans in the 1970s, it is now a compellingly eerie ghost village, and tour guides like Wade Austin – whose father was a ferry captain – still have living memories of Henry Pigott and Marian Babb, the last man and woman to live there.Austin has travelled the world, but nothing would tempt him from Ocracoke. “I’m not much of the city to begin with. I saw the world, and I came back. It’s what most people here do.”• Wayfaring Stranger: a Musical Journey in the American South by Emma John is published by W\u0026ampN (£16.99).

London is not the only place with strange ways, or at least where a great deal of things happen in unimaginably rapid succession. This was a great episode for fans of primitive cave bombs, reckless chasm-jumping, ill-advised derring-do, amateur beachside amputations and bedside waterboarding. My heart was softened by the reappearance of Horace the Pug early on, and as events raced by I alternated between mildly weepy and completely broken. Then Valentine met his half-siblings and I was all puddle.It’s hard to know where to start with this episode, where as many things happened in one hour’s screen time as have happened in the previous four series. And yet it was masterfully managed. Most importantly, though, Horace the Pug returned! He’s put on weight. But obviously that’s his prerogative. Not content with addressing each other in the third person, Dr Enys and Sindy Doll were now speaking to each other exclusively through the dog. I do love these two – and their chemistry is a great compliment to that of Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson. These pairings – alongside the contrasting charms of Jack Farthing (Sir Evil George) and Heida (Ghost Elizabeth) – have been the backbone of this show. Horace is just the plump cherry on the cake.The scenes at Caroline’s party were delicious I almost needed a reviving tincture to keep up with it. Questions about the treatment of Sir Evil George’s lunacy. An encounter between Morwenna and the mother of the pig’s-tail-buttocked vicar about Morwenna’s sickly child who has acquired some mastery in fencing. A warning to Demelza about the malice of Tess. Some extraordinary cakes. A brilliant moment between the slave trader and Kitty Despard. And if that weren’t enough plot, here was an accident at the mine with various opportunities for showcasing gore and corpses.Meanwhile Sir Evil George was in an increasingly bad way. “These will relieve the melancholic congestion of the brain.” Leeches! No! They’re as bad as the terrible tincture Elizabeth took. Bring Dr Enys and his unproven methods to Sir Evil George. A hearty salute to Jack Farthing for inhabiting this difficult role so excellently even Cary Warleggan thought the waterboarding was a bit much. Thank goodness for a second opinion. “I thought you were about to fall.” “Would it matter?” “I wonder, would you allow me to accompany you back to Trenwith?” Put Dr Enys in charge of all hostage negotiation situations immediately. “The only lunatic in this room is here. His methods will induce madness, not cure it.” Yes, Dr Enys, speak ye loud!I love the anti-American narrative building up around Prudie in the fragmentary glimpses we get of her. (Not enough Prudie in this series. We demand a Prudie spinoff series, please, alongside the spinoff series for Sir Evil George’s chin.) And moody Tess is superb. “We aren’t all lucky enough to sell our body to our master for the price of a wedding ring.” Way to tell Demelza to check her privilege.The learnin’ and the smashin’ of prejudice around mental illness, gender and race weigh heavy this series. Was Demelza and Morwenna’s literacy project a step too far? Probably, but never mind. “Truly difference betwixt commons and learned is simply that: learnin’.” Fortunately Poldark has earned the privilege to preach like this and they’re just about getting away with it so far. We shall see if it all gets a bit much as the series progresses.T’is a shameful fact that until now, the music has never been mentioned here over five series. Time to remedy that. This week I want to give a melodic tavern shout-out to the composer of the soaring Poldark earworm, Anne Dudley. The theme tune that plays over the title credits is an orchestral arrangement designed “to underscore the Cornish sweeping landscapes and passionate love story.” Top marks to Dudley, who won an Oscar for best score for The Full Monty and has worked on arrangements for The Pet Shop Boys, Elton John and Pulp. May many over-filled tankards be raised aloft to all the excellent musicians involved, and especially to lead violinist Chris Garrick. I have such a Pavlovian response to this theme now (causing immediate lowering of blood pressure) that I am going to miss the music almost as much as Demelza’s National Velvet outfit. • “Ned, I think we’re wanted elsewhere.” The best way ever to say to someone, “It’s time to leave.”• “Sir George has been called away to the … north … of England.” AKA: his bedroom from which banging can be heard. The barbaric north! Genius prevarication.• “Meanwhile I’m supposed to look Morwenna and Caroline in the face and tell them you’ve all gone fishing?” “Excellent idea.” Ross and Demelza’s relationship in a nutshell.• “I’ve lost one son to greedy mine-owners, I won’t lose another to highfalutin nonsense.” I would give an Academy Award to John Macneill (Jacka Hoblyn, father of Tommy) purely for his delivery of this line which was beyond reproach in impossible circumstances. One of the great things about Poldark is the strong ensemble cast, many of whom have been in the series since the beginning and inhabit their background roles as if they really are living in the period. Tricorns off to all.• “I do hold a finger to my tongue. I do hold a finger waiting.” A strange song, t’were indeed, but Demelza sang it well.As I have predicted, due to the intervention of Aidan Turner’s agent, all of Ross’s feats of derring-do in a hot and sweaty underground cave were conducted not only fully clothed but wearing a fully buttoned-up shirt and an extra waistcoat. Instead we got naked Demelza in the bath. We don’t want naked Demelza in the bath, we want her in her National Velvet costume!Sir Evil George has taken refuge in a world of shadows. Morwenna goes back to her son. Ned goes on the attack.

His family had insurance. He did not believe it was possible a one-month supply of “life saving” medication could cost so much.Then a student and football player at DePauw University, he began to ration his insulin, using a quarter of what had been prescribed. He lost weight. His grades dropped. He struggled on the field.Fortunately, his mother found out and stopped him from rationing his insulin – a practice that is increasingly common and potentially deadly. On Sunday, Sego and his mother, Kathy, drove seven hours from Indiana to join a caravan of roughly a dozen patients with Type 1 diabetes on a bus to Canada with Vermont senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The Americans – wearing glucose monitors on their arms and shirts that said “diabetic” – set out to buy insulin for a fraction of its cost at home.Sanders’ northern sojourn, a trip his campaign sponsored, was designed to highlight the rising cost of prescription drugs in the US, which the senator said was the result of “incredible corruption and greed” on the part of the US pharmaceutical industry.“How does it happen 10 minutes away from the American border in Michigan, people here are paying one-10th of the price for the vitally important drug they need to stay alive?” Sanders asked, calling the disparity a “national embarrassment”.In his remarks outside of the Olde Walkerville Pharmacy in Windsor, Sanders vowed that as president he would appoint an attorney general to investigate the pharmaceutical industry for what he described as “collusion” between the major drug companies.“Prices go up and up and up at the same level for the same companies,” he said. “So what you do is you throw these people in jail if they engage in price-fixing.”The trip came just two days before the second Democratic debate in Detroit. Among 20 candidates over two nights, healthcare is expected to be a major flashpoint.Sanders has exchanged barbs with former Vice-President Joe Biden, who has called the senator’s healthcare policies “risky”. Sanders has accused Biden, whose healthcare plan would build on the Affordable Care Act, of not being honest about Medicare for all.Sanders’ signature proposal, which would give the US something similar to Canada’s national healthcare system, has framed the party debate. Several leading candidates support some version of it.The bus took about an hour to drive six miles across the Detroit river to Windsor, Ontario. Sanders listened as people told their stories.Quinn Nystrom, a Type 1 diabetic who organizes caravans out of Minnesota, said she knew people who had lost limbs, been hospitalized or even died as a result of rationing medicine.“Insulin is our oxygen,” she said, stressing that caravan trips are not a sustainable solution to the problem, especially because many cannot afford to take a day off of work or find the fee to apply for a passport.When the bus arrived at the pharmacy, around 100 Canadians greeted the passengers. Some held signs that said “Insulin is a human right”. A little girl held a Sanders plush toy with a button on the back that said: “Push to activate the revolution.” An elderly man played accordion while trying to finagle a moment with the senator.In Canada, insulin does not require a prescription. When the American group finished their purchases, Sanders drew gasps from the Canadian crowd.Citing a Yale study, he told them that one in four American diabetics ration their insulin because of cost. That prince for one vial has risen astronomically in two decades, he said, as pharmaceutical companies have spent “hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign contributions” and “billions of dollars lobbying Congress”.“They buy and sell politicians, Republicans and Democrats,” the senator said, “to make sure that they can continue to charge the American people any price they want. This is not just insulin, it is prescription drug after prescription drug.”Kathy and Hunter Sego paid $1,000 for 25 vials of insulin, enough for about six months. They estimated it would have cost $10,000 more for the same supply back home.Speaking to the crowd at the pharmacy, she described the hardship of choosing to pay the electricity bill or for son’s medicine. On at least two occasion’s their power has been turned off. “How can that be that in the United States of America that I am paying so much for insulin?” she asked, fighting back tears. Sanders’ Medicare for all plan would cap the out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs at $200 per year. Earlier this year, he introduced a package of bills aimed at lowering prices. The legislation would allow the government to directly negotiate with drug manufacturers, to obtain lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries. It would also enable US consumers to import pills from Canada and other industrialized countries and it would set drug prices based on what they cost in those other places.“This resonates in Canada as well,” said Nada Temerinski, 29, who had come from Montreal.Unlike Sanders’ vision for the US, Canada has a private heath insurance since its system does not cover the cost of all benefits, such as prescription drugs. Instead, a review board negotiates prices in part based on rates in other countries.“I would hope that it inspires Canadian politicians,” Temerinski said of Sanders’ work. “I’m hoping as America moves further left, that Canada does as well and ideally we could move towards prescription-free.”Rachael Lockwood, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, was sharing insulin prescribed for one child with Type 1 diabetes between two when another son was diagnosed.“We were desperate,” she said. On Sunday, she and her three children aged 7, 12, and 16, made their second trip to Canada for the insulin.In 2016, she voted for Donald Trump in hopes that a businessman might be able to fix the nation’s problems. But now that she is a “medical refugee,” as one member of the caravan described them, forced to travel abroad for affordable medicine, her perspective has changed. Trump, she said, will not be her choice in 2020.This was not Sanders’ first trip to Canada for prescription drugs. He said he had made a similar trip from Vermont to Montreal, with women with breast cancer.“It never ends,” he said, shaking his head. “The greed of the pharmaceutical industry – the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry – is scandalous and we have got to take them on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4440ffcd6c94dc3d6249264d623cae5063253a7e/0_115_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52b318d0ecafe1b3e101112cd1b7d4d8","title":"morbidly sensible adulting no way getting life insurance is empowering","story":"Does the thought of tackling life insurance send you into a slumber? Here’s why it could be worth giving it another shot …TV, takeaways and, erm, life insurance – I know which I’d rather commit to tonight when I get home. Admittedly, insurance isn’t exactly the sexiest of weeknight propositions, so it’s hardly any wonder so many of us choose to bury our heads in the proverbial sand when it comes to facing it. But before you fall into a slumber deeper than Snow White on a hangover, let me tell you why it might be worth giving it five minutes of your time (it won’t take any longer than that, promise).You see, life insurance is one of those things that makes perfect sense on paper - the kind of task you wonder why you didn’t get round to sorting once you realise what it actually involves (before swiftly ignoring it again for another six months, if you’re anything like me). I mean, think about it, how many important things have you taken the time to insure in your lifetime? I can name several - a car, the odd holiday, my home and a smartphone (or six). So why is it we’re neglecting to insure the most important thing of all?A quick straw poll of my friends reveals the many reasons we don’t. Some figure that not having children, a partner, or owning a home, means they don’t need it – they reason there’s no point spending money on something they don’t actually need yet. But if either of those things could plausibly happen in the near future, it might be worth planning ahead (after all, you’ll have more pressing things to worry about once any #wedmin kicks in, and doing it sooner likely means lower monthly payments, too). It’s also worth asking whether any dependants or loved ones would be financially stable without you, since life insurance could take care of that (something not many of us like to think about, granted).Life insurance could also be very useful for anybody jointly responsible for mortgage payments. What happens if one person dies before the mortgage is paid (nope, not a fun discussion but an important one)? Experts flag that we shouldn’t assume death-in-service cover or life insurance via your employer means we don’t need to worry about life insurance, either, unfortunately. While useful, workplace cover tends to pay out benefits as a multiple of salary (eg four-years’ salary) to ensure your family has cash available to make up for the loss of your salary to maintain their lifestyle it may not cover any large financial commitments, such as a mortgage.What are the available options? Well, Aviva offers three types of life insurance: cover that remains the same, and so do the payments cover and premiums that increase over time and cover that decreases.For the latter, the value of the cover goes down each month, but your regular payments stay the same. People usually use this product to cover a repayment mortgage, which also decreases.If you’re looking to help cover your salary and maintain loved ones’ living standards or to settle your mortgage and provide reassurance – then you may want to go for the same level, or increasing if you want some protection against the effects of inflation. Still with me? Good.The best part is there’s minimal legwork – most customers could get a quote and decision in just over five minutes (reading this is probably the most arduous part, sorry) and it might be cheaper than you think, with policies starting at around £5 a month. So we could all start protecting our loved ones immediately.Pretty awesome, right? And probably much smarter than putting it off until your next birthday, and spending more when we do bite the bullet (since policies tend to get more expensive the older you are). Making that decision suddenly feels like a no-brainer to me – what about you? Then we can all get back to that boxset and tikka masala …For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf6d882003f288fe71fb8e290c0aabe2a8009c1/0_166_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d0a797aefa752860073bd8b0980f56e","title":"mussolini birthplace cashes in on rise far right tourism","story":"Dressed in black T-shirts, their arms inked with tattoos, Fabrizio and Mameli Gamberini are on their yearly homage trip to Predappio, the birth town and burial place of Benito Mussolini.“We’re fascists,” Mameli proudly admits as she leaves Predappio Tricolore, a souvenir shop teeming with Mussolini memorabilia, on Friday morning. “We come every year at the end of July to buy a few new keepsakes, visit his tomb and leave some flowers in his honour.”The couple, from Varese, are in Predappio, a town nestled among the hills of the Appenines in the Emilia-Romagna region, to celebrate the 136th anniversary of the Italian dictator’s birth on 29 July.It is one of three occasions over the past two years, including the anniversary of his death on 28 April and the march on Rome on 28 October, that the Mussolini family crypt has been opened to the public since it was closed for restoration works in 2017.The anniversaries have always attracted thousands of fascist pilgrims from across Italy and beyond, who join a parade that leads to the tiny San Cassiano cemetery, where they pay tribute to Il Duce (The Leader) with a fascist salute, leaving messages of admiration in the guest book. A card attached to a bunch of flowers left recently said: “Thank you, Duce”.The Gamberinis are now thrilled to learn that they might again be able to pay their respects on any day of the year after the town’s recently elected rightwing mayor, Roberto Canali, last week announced controversial plans to reopen the crypt all year round as a way to boost tourism.Most residents in this town of about 6,000 accept the influx of fascists on the anniversaries as a necessary evil as they are the most fruitful days of the year for shops, bars and hotels, hence the reason why there has been little criticism locally of Canali’s plans.In fact his pledge, which has been supported by Mussolini’s granddaughters, Rachele and Alessandra, was an election campaign winner.“After the tomb was closed, so many businesses complained about the loss of custom,” Canali told the Observer. “Apart from those three intense days a year, we get a continuous flow of people who, dressed normally, come out of curiosity or to understand history, but who are disappointed to find the tomb closed.”Claudia Brunazzi, a representative from the local business association, Albero Rosso, said: “It’s a pity that Predappio is only remembered for this, as there is so much more – the wine, food, scenery – but ... opening the tomb is useful for business.”Needless to say, Canali’s plans triggered a sharp rebuke from Italy’s anti-fascist association, ANPI, which is planning to protest on Sunday (the day the crypt will be open).“This muddies the memories of the many victims of fascist crime, its racial laws and collaboration with the Nazis that led to the massacre of innocent women, men and children,” the association said in a statement.Luca Capacci, a spokesperson for Possibile, a small leftwing party, said: “It’s very sad and worrying that the opening of the tomb is seen as an attractive element in a territory that has much more to offer. It’s not a historic monument like the Colosseum … the people who go there do so to celebrate a dictator.”It is unclear when the tomb, whose opening to the public is at the behest of the Mussolini family, would be opened permanently, as town leaders still need to work out who will foot the €30,000-a-year bill for it to be guarded and maintained – the town or the family. One of the reasons it hasn’t been reopened since restoration works was because the previous custodian, a devout Mussolini fan, did the job for free for years.Nostalgic factions of the Italian population have long helped keep the spirit of Mussolini alive, but thriving rightwing populism has been further dismantling the taboo. Matteo Salvini, deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League, sometimes quotes Mussolini, and during a European election campaign rally in Forlì, close to Predappio, he addressed a crowd from the same balcony where the dictator watched his opponents being killed.Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, were shot dead by partisans in the final days of the second world war before their bodies were strung up at a filling station in a Milan square. His remains were brought to Predappio in 1957.One of the reasons his spirit lingers is because some Italians consider him to be the country’s last “strongman” leader, who not only restored law and order but who built better housing, roads, transport systems and schools, while also investing in industry and introducing a welfare system.People such as the Gamberinis still struggle to square up to his misdeeds. “It’s thanks to Mussolini that we have pensions,” said Mameli. “His main mistake was siding with Hitler – and he paid for it.”Canali is unable to provide official data on how many people visit Predappio, which was rebuilt on Mussolini’s orders in the 1920s, each year past estimates suggest 100,000. But without doubt, the town also pulls in a steady flow of people who come simply out of curiosity.Last October a week-long history tour of Italy, called “Duce! The Rise and Fall of Italian Fascism” and organised by a British firm, Historical Trips, sold out. Rachele Mussolini met the group on the Predappio leg of the trip to answer questions about her grandfather’s legacy.Other than the cemetery, people can wander around the house in which he was born.“It’s incredible that this place even exists,” said Pieter Floore, an archaeologist from the Netherlands who stopped in Predappio with his family on Friday morning as they made their way home from a holiday in the nearby Marche region.The rightwing surge across Italy helped to end more than 70 years of leftwing rule in Predappio upon Canali’s election in late May. Canali ran on an independent civil list, but was strongly backed by the small far-right party, Brothers of Italy, to which Rachele belongs.Unable to stop people coming to the town, whether out of intrigue or nostalgia, former mayor Giorgio Frassineti is still endeavouring to open a museum aimed at teaching people about Italy’s dark period, rather than glorifying it. Frassineti also fought to close the souvenir shops selling fascist paraphernalia during his time as mayor. Up until a few years ago the town had three or four shops. Only Predappio Tricolore, which sells everything from black shirts and fez hats to Mussolini busts, mugs, calendars and even baby clothes featuring one of his famous quotes – “who dares wins” – remains open today.The owner, Pierluigi Pompiglioni, was in a jovial mood as he poured red wine from a bottle emblazoned with Mussolini’s image for the keen customers who dropped by on Friday. Locals joke that Pompiglioni is Predappio’s richest man, having enjoyed a brisk trade for years.“But for the last couple, due to the tomb being closed, business has been bad,” he complained. He doesn’t see anything wrong in selling merchandise that celebrates fascism. “Fascism is dead, Mussolini is dead – those who buy these things are just rightwing people who want political change.”Others beg to differ.“If we think fascism is only about wearing a black T-shirt or a fez, we are very much mistaken,” said Capacci. “Mussolini may be dead but the ideology he created is not completely dead, as is demonstrated every day in the news and politics, not only in Italy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Local authorities receive just a handful of notifications of short-term rental propertiesMonths after the death of Polish man Michal Wasikiewicz on the steps of St Audoen\u0026rsquos Church in Dublin, his family are still trying to figure out what happenedThe project will involve the construction of an underpass on the North Circular RoadF\u0026oacutersa issues warning amid calls for review of pay agreement due to rising inflationMinister set to signal extension to accelerated process for Strategic Housing DevelopmentsRule change paves way for Anila Devasia to be first contestant not of Irish heritageA unique institution continues to accommodate those people of ergent political viewsBill for doctors, nurses and support staff to plug healthcare gaps comes in at \u0026euro135mSummer tuition scheme excludes those with mild or moderate learning disabilityGabriel Makhlouf\u0026rsquos succession to top post triggered direct contact by Frankfurt officialsMichal Wasikiewicz was found dead on Cook Street on November 6th, 2018 after sleeping outdoorsSurvey finds 725,000 eligible people have never made use of their entitlementsNorthern Ireland police are dealing with an increasing number of fake appealsThrills and jaw-dropping moments drew 40,000 to Co Wicklow seafront on SundayCraftsmen and women put many hours of work into creations for 10th year of festivalIrish man was scared by arrest in US but remains hopeful of avoiding deportationFewer barriers and more activities make for successful trial after criticism of first attemptSome 14,500 speeding fines handed out along road since works began, with 241 incidentsNo one injured in incident and garda\u0026iacute recover sawn-off shotgun from Dublin street"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3969980.1564331448!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"garda s%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na to replace huawei equipment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn Garda Síochána has moved to replace   IT equipment  made by Chinese company Huawei. File photograph: Fred DufourAFPGetty Images An Garda Síochána has moved to replace IT equipment made by Chinese company Huawei.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said the only pieces of Huawei equipment used by the force are “branded modems supplied by mobile network operators”.“These external modems are being phased out, as they are being replaced by laptops with an internal modem,” Mr Flanagan said.Fianna Fáil science and technology spokesman James Lawless has tabled a series of parliamentary questions on the issue of Huawei, which has been at the centre of cyber security concerns across the world. It is claimed that its technology could be used for spying or international property theft by China, allegations rejected by the company. Countries such as the United States, New Zealand, Australia and Japan have already banned Huawei products from sensitive networks.Although the published parliamentary questions did not name Huawei, Mr Lawless confirmed he was referring to the Chinese company.He asked Mr Flanagan about his contacts with Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on the use of Huawei technology and if it would be removed “from all equipment used by An Garda Síochána in the interests of national security”.However, a Garda spokeswoman said the changes are being made for reasons of convenience.Mr Flanagan replied that Mr Harris is “responsible for managing and controlling the administration and business of An Garda Síochána”, including in relation to IT.“I am informed by the Garda authorities that in general and for operational reasons, An Garda Síochána does not comment on the specifics of particular equipment in use in the organisation,” Mr Flanagan said.“However in relation to the matter raised by the deputy, the Garda authorities have indicated that An Garda Síochána purchases the majority of its ICT equipment through Office of Government Procurement frameworks.“The Garda authorities have further advised me that the only equipment in use in An Garda Síochána which has been manufactured by the company referred by the deputy are branded modems supplied by mobile network operators. I am further informed that these external modems are being phased out, as they are being replaced by laptops with an internal modem.”A spokeswoman for An Garda Síochána, when asked if the changes are being made for security reasons, said: “The laptop devices with external modems are being replaced by laptops with internal modems for the convenience of having a single device.”Nevertheless, Mr Lawless, a Kildare North TD, said it is a “significant move”.“Various countries around the world have moved to stop the installation of Huawei technology, while closer to home the chief of UK’s intelligence service MI6 has made a significant intervention urging caution on the technology,” he said.“I have been contacted privately by senior sources in the telecoms and IT industry. They have warned me that companies in their sector are becoming increasingly concerned about Huawei and that they will refuse to work on networks which may potentially be compromised.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3970048.1564338704!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"keith byrne nothing good comes from sending me home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKeith Byrne with his wife Keren. The Cork man remains optimistic that his status in the US could be normalised. An Irish man who was imprisoned as part of Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration says he is optimistic about winning the right to stay in the US.Keith Byrne (37), from Fermoy, Co Cork, was released from detention in Pennsylvania last week following a court ruling and was reunited with his family. However, he still faces deportation proceedings and may have to return to custody once his 30-day temporary release period expires.Mr Byrne, who lives in Philadelphia, first entered the US on a 90-day Visa Waiver programme in 2007. He stayed on in the US after his visa expired and married his wife Keren there two years later.He has been attempting to regularise his immigration status through the legal system for several years but a minor conviction from Ireland for cannabis possession has complicated his efforts.Mr Byrne said he was shocked and confused by his arrest because he had “been fighting for a long time to make things right”.He said it was “really special” to be reunited with his wife and children following two weeks in Pike County jail.“It’s good to be home. It’s where I belong.”US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arrested Mr Byrne in Philadelphia as he drove to his painting business. He said he was put in cuffs and shackles before officers “threw him in a cell”.‘Horrible’Being sent back to Ireland would be “horrible”, he said, given he has a family and business in the US.“Nothing good comes from sending me home”.He said he was optimistic about winning the right to stay in the US with his family and that he would meet his legal team on Monday to discuss the next step.“I’m optimistic. I’m hopeful. I’m just going to leave it with the law and hopefully my lawyers can make it happen. I’m just going to keep working hard and keep doing what I was doing.”Mr Byrne said he “never hid” in the US and that his conviction for drugs possession was embarrassing.“It’s a 14-year-old fine that I paid in court. I don’t know what kind of message people are giving out by sending me home over that. I’ve made a good life over here so, I’ve paid my penalty.”Mr Byrne has until the end of August to seek a judicial review of the decision of the US authorities to deny his legal status.However, the order states that “nothing . . . precludes the United States and ICE from redetaining Keith Byrne or reinstituting removal proceedings”.Mr Byrne’s arrest was part of a wider crackdown by ICE officers in 10 major US cities. Most of the 2,000 migrants targeted were from central America and had crossed the US-Mexican border.The sweep had been touted ahead of time by Mr Trump, the US president, as a show of force against illegal immigration. However, the vast majority of the migrants targeted by ICE evaded arrest. According to the New York Times, only 35 people were detained."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3969973.1564330641!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"only a fraction of airbnb landlords register under new letting rules","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOnly a fraction of the landlords who have rented out properties on AirBnB and other home-sharing websites have registered them under the Government’s new short-term letting rules. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe  Only a fraction of the landlords who have rented out properties on Airbnb and other “home-sharing” websites have registered them under the Government’s new short-term letting rules.Figures obtained from local authorities in rent pressure zones – in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick where the housing crisis is at its worst – show few people have registered their properties.The regulations have been in place since July 1st, when new legislation came into effect aimed at easing the housing crisis by freeing up available accommodation to address a shortage of rental properties.People intending to rent out properties in the pressure zones must either register with their local authority or apply for change-of-use planning permission to be able to let them out under the new rules. Only people who rent out a room in their home, or their entire home, for 90 days or less can register.Iniduals renting out a home for more than 90 days or landlords letting out a second property to tourist or others on a\u0026nbspshort-term basis must apply for planning permission either on a new or retention basis.Permission is likely to be denied in rent pressure zones, effectively banning short-term lettings in response to the housing shortages.Dublin City Council told The  that it had received 110 registrations for properties and four applications for planning permission as of last week.These figures contrast with the 6,228 active rentals in Dublin on Airbnb last year, according to AirDNA, a data service that analyses listings on the home-sharing website.AirDNA found that last year there were 2,856 entire homes in Dublin rented out for more than 90 days, while 3,398 home-sharers had rented out their homes for less than 90 days.Galway City Council has received eight registrations – known as Form 15 registrations under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2019 – and just one planning application.Limerick City Council had received just two notifications as of last week.A spokesman for Cork County Council said that it had received two Form 15 registrations but had not received any planning applications for change of use under the new regulations.The ability and resources available to investigate breaches of the regulations remain a concern for local authorities.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy said late last month that 12 staff would be added to Dublin City Council to deal with planning applications over the coming months.Other councils have not received any extra resources, however.‘No enforcement’“The difficulty with this is the regulations came in but there is no enforcement resources coming with them so how do you find out if people are in breach? What canny detective work can be undertaken if it is just another task added on to the list of tasks that already have to be enforced,” said one council official.The official complained that it was “very difficult” to detect potential breaches of the legislation and obtain enough evidence “to go to court” without additional resources.Failure to comply with the regulations carries a maximum penalty of €5,000 or six months’ imprisonment or both.Airbnb objected to the new rules, warning that it would jeopardise more than €500 million generated by the home-sharing service for the economy in 2018."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3970035.1564335821!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"persistent speeding during m7 upgrade works criticised","story":"Speeding motorists have been the biggest issue facing those working on the upgrade of the M7 motorway in Co Kildare over the past 20 months, the chief executive of one of the construction firms behind the project has said.SIAC and Colas were awarded the contract to upgrade the motorway. Work to widen a 13.5km stretch of the road between Naas and the M7M9 interchange got under way in January 2018.An end to the works appears to be in sight, and this week all three lanes are due to be in operation but with a reduced 80kmh speed limit. Outstanding verge works are scheduled to be completed by mid-September, and the speed limit will rise to 120kmh after that.Motorists have expressed unhappiness about delays and speed cameras on the route, with two detection vans deployed at the end of last year to monitor compliance with the reduced 60kmh limit.Figures from Transport Infrastructure Ireland show 14,500 speeding fines have been handed out along the road since the works began. The number of offences recorded led local District Court Judge Desmond Zaidan to question how to deal with the large increase in related court cases. The Courts Service said it was looking at a number of solutions to the problem.Michael Maher, chief executive of SIAC Construction, said speeding along the route had caused major issues, with 241 incidents occurring since the works began, the majority of which he attributed to people driving too fast.“Thankfully no one was hurt – it was mostly rear-ends and that type of thing,” he said. “The cameras certainly helped, and I would argue that while people might give out about the reduced speed limit, the delay is minimum.”‘Ambitious timeline’It was originally anticipated by the contractor that all three lanes of the M7 would be operational in both directions by April. Mr Maher says the timeline for the project was “ambitious”.There has on average been 200-300 construction personnel working on the road every day while about 78,000 motorists use the route per day – some 22 million per year.Niall Morrissey, director of services with Kildare County Council, said the local authority had identified a “total non-compliance” with the 60kmh speed limit and encouraged the contractor to “take some action” in the interest of employee safety.“From our perspective, our responsibility is towards the employees on the site. 60kmh would be the industry norm when you’re working on a live site, and we could see the total non-compliance with that speed limit. It was grossly unfair to the employees trying to go about their daily work,” he said.Transport Infrastructure Ireland said motorists should notice a difference to their journeys, particularly on the commute home, when the lanes open.“To have three lanes operational by the time people are back to work and school, that will be a good thing,” a spokesman said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3969808.1564314676!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain operating on assumption of no deal brexit says gove","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove: Simply presenting Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement to parliament again would ‘not be enough’. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergThe UK government is “operating on the assumption” that Britain will leave the EU without a deal on October 31st, Michael Gove has said.Mr Gove, who is in charge of no-deal preparations in the Cabinet Office, said there was a “very real prospect” that an agreement would not be struck with Brussels before the Halloween deadline.Writing in The Sunday Times, he said that while the aim was still to leave with a deal, the Government needed to prepare for every eventuality.“With a new prime minister, a new government, and a new clarity of mission, we will exit the EU on October 31st. No ifs. No buts. No more delay. Brexit is happening,” he said.“The EU’s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach — it’s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it,” he added.“We still hope they will change their minds, but we must operate on the assumption that they will not.”Mr Gove said the British government would do “everything in our power” to secure a good deal for the UK, but said simply presenting Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement to parliament again would not be enough.“You can’t just reheat the dish that’s been sent back and expect that will make it more palatable,” he wrote.Planning for no deal was now a “number one priority”, he said, as the paper reported that Mr Johnson had put together a “war cabinet” of six key ministers to deliver Brexit by October 31st “by any means necessary”.Chancellor Sajid Javid has said there will be “significant extra funding” this week to get Britain “fully ready to leave” the EU on October 31st, with or without a deal.The additional spending will include financing one of the country’s “biggest ever public information campaigns” to ensure iniduals and businesses are ready for a no-deal exit, Mr Javid told the Sunday .“Under my leadership, the Treasury will have new priorities and will play its full role in helping to deliver Brexit,” he said.“In my first day in office as Chancellor, I tasked officials to urgently identify where more money needs to be invested to get Britain fully ready to leave on October 31st — deal or no deal.”InfrastructureHe added that he planned to fund 500 new border force officers and look at new infrastructure around the country’s ports to minimise congestion and ensure goods can flow.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said she will back Boris Johnson as prime minister, but will not give her support to no-deal Brexit.Ms Davidson insisted that her position in the Scottish parliament exists independently of Westminster and that she does not have to sign any no-deal pledge to continue to serve.“When I was debating against the pro-Brexit side in 2016, I don’t remember anybody saying we should crash out of the EU with no arrangements in place to help maintain the vital trade that flows uninterrupted between Britain and the European Union, Ms Davidson said in the Mail on Sunday.“I don’t think the UK Government should pursue a no-deal Brexit, and if it comes to it, I won’t support it.Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn has said he is “not in the slightest” bit worried about going up against Boris Johnson in a general election.The Labour leader said the party has most candidates selected in marginal constituencies and a “summer campaign plan” is in place.Mr Corbyn said Labour also has many policy announcements ready.Speaking on Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday, Mr Corbyn said he will do everything he can to stop no-deal Brexit: “We will do everything to challenge this Government, and we will do it at a time of our choosing.”Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said he was working on a cross-party alliance to prevent a no-deal Brexit.He told The Observer: “The political direction of travel under Boris Johnson is clear, and so it is more important than ever that we build a strong cross-party alliance to stop a no-deal Brexit.“That work will intensify over the summer, before parliament resumes in September.”Meanwhile, polls have suggested the Tories were boosted by a “Boris bounce” after the election of their new leader.Since Mr Johnson became Prime Minister after being declared party chief by Tory members, the Conservatives have gained 10 points to stand at 30 per cent, a survey by Deltapoll for the Mail on Sunday showed.That puts them five points ahead of Labour at 25 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent and the Brexit Party on 14 per cent.But if Labour was to drop Jeremy Corbyn as leader, the poll says the party would shoot into the lead at 34 per cent, with the Tories on 28 per cent, the Brexit Party on 14 per cent and the Lib Dems on 13 per cent.The poll came as Mr Johnson set out an eye-catching domestic stall promising a £3.6 billion boost for left-behind towns.He also pledged funding for a new rail link between Manchester and Leeds and promised action on housing and crime, despite insisting he was not preparing for a snap autumn election.– PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Isabel InfantesAFPGettyBoris Johnson’s government is planning a huge increase in funding for a no-deal Brexit after one of his ministers said its working assumption was that the UK would leave the European Union without a deal on October 31st.Mr Johnson has set up a six-person “war cabinet” to oversee preparations for a no-deal Brexit, including a major public information campaign, and stepped-up logistical plans to mitigate disruption.Michael Gove, who until last week was his government’s most eloquent champion of the withdrawal agreement, said yesterday that planning for a no-deal Brexit was now the top priority.“The EU’s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach – it’s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it. We still hope they will change their minds, but we must operate on the assumption that they will not,” the cabinet office minister wrote in the Sunday Times.Chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid promised “significant extra funding” for hundreds of new Border Force officers and infrastructural improvements. He did not specify the size of the extra investment but reports suggest it could be as much as £1 billion.In Dublin, Government sources noted the stridency of the no-deal messages, and the change in rhetoric from London. A spokesman for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar noted that Mr Johnson had said he “wants to leave the EU with a deal”.“The Taoiseach looks forward to speaking with the prime minister in the near future and hearing about how he plans to do that,” the spokesman said, adding that the EU has said the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened but that there can be changes to the political declaration on the future relationship.“We continue to prepare intensively for no-deal,” he said.No contactNo phone call has yet been arranged between Mr Varadkar and Mr Johnson, but Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has spoken to Mr Javid, and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has been in contact with his UK counterpart, Dominic Raab.The Conservatives have enjoyed a poll boost since Mr Johnson took office as Brexit Party supporters have begun to swing behind the new prime minister. Labour has also seen a modest increase in its support but the Conservatives have opened up a 10-point lead.Chief secretary to the treasury Rishi Sunak said the government’s preference was to leave the EU with a deal but without what he called the “anti-democratic” backstop.But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson warned ahead of a visit to Scotland by Mr Johnson today that she could not support leaving the EU without a deal. “I don’t think the government should pursue a no-deal Brexit and, if it comes to it, I won’t support it,” she said.The EU has rejected Mr Johnson’s demand that the Northern Irish backstop should be removed from the withdrawal agreement, and French MEP Nathalie Loiseau said the agreement was the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit.“You have changed your prime minister, but we have not changed our minds,” she told Sky News. “The agreement is a compromise there are many concessions in it. We are protecting our citizens, peace on the island of Ireland. The agreement is not the devil, it’s a reasonable compromise to move forward.”Meanwhile, a committee set up in the United States to protect the Belfast Agreement, which includes five former US ambassadors to Ireland, has warned the incoming Northern Ireland secretary that a future US-UK trade deal will be “all but impossible” if the peace deal is undermined."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3969958.1564329439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd democratic puritanism ruining 2020 hopes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi with fellow House Democrats on the steps outside the US Capitol. She is derided by the far left for her pragmatism, despite being a long-time target for Republicans. Photograph: Getty I, the daughter of a DC cop, and Carl, the son of an Illinois plumber, were hilariously painted as decadent aristocrats revelling like Marie Antoinette when we should have been knitting like Madame Defarge. Yo, proletariat: If the Democratic Party is going to be against chocolate, high heels, parties and fun, you’ve lost me.And I’ve got some bad news for you about 2020. The progressives are the modern Puritans. The Massachusetts Bay Colony is alive and well on the Potomac and Twitter. They eviscerate their natural allies for not being pure enough while placing all their hopes in a colour-inside-the-lines lifelong Republican prosecutor appointed by Ronald Reagan. The politics of purism makes people stupid. And nasty. My father stayed up all night the night Harry Truman was elected because he was so excited. I would like to stay up ’til dawn the night a Democrat wins next year because I’m so excited to see the moment when the despicable Donald Trump lumbers into a Marine helicopter and flies away for good.But Democrats are making that dream ever more distant because they are using their time knifing one another and those who want to be on their side instead of playing it smart. House Democrats forced Robert Mueller to testify, after he made it clear that he was spent and had nothing to add to his damning yet damnably legalistic, double-negative report, because they were hoping the hearings would jump-start howls for impeachment.But it’s hard to get the mad blood stirring with Muellerisms like “This is outside my purview” “I can’t get into that” “I don’t subscribe necessarily to your – the way you analyse that” and “I’m not going to go into the ins and outs.” I never want to hear about the “OLC opinion” again. The Republicans were impressively craven and hypocritical. They are sticking with Trump, and no pallid reminder of his turpitude, his trellis of obstructions and his unpatriotic embrace of foreign interference in our elections will change that.The always blockheaded Texas representative Louie Gohmert shouldn’t even be allowed to hold the coat of Mueller, a war hero and respected public official. But Gohmert yelled such crazy stuff at the former special counsel that he appeared to be auditioning for a spot on Fox News’ The Five.The hearings were shameful for Republicans thirsting for re-election and a failure for Democrats thirsting for impeachment. It was many underwhelming hours of members of Congress reading to Mueller and Mueller saying, Yes, that’s what I wrote. Or at least what somebody wrote.The recipe for emotional satisfaction on the part of the progressive left is not a recipe for removing Trump from the White House. The argument about whether Trump is impeachable is the wrong argument. Mueller settled that. We know Trump did things worthy of impeachment. That is not the question we should be asking. The question is: should he be impeached? The progressive Puritans think we must honour the US constitution and go for it because it’s the right thing to do. You can argue that impeachment, morally and constitutionally, is the right thing to do.But you also have to recognise that, historically and politically, it is not the right thing to do because it will lead to disaster. The attempt to impeach Trump is one of the rare cases in which something obviously justified is obviously stupid. Unbelievably, Pelosi – long a GOP target for her unalloyed liberalism – is derided by the far left for her pragmatism. But she has been through enough Washington wars to know that idealism, untempered by realism, is dangerous. An impeachment could return Trump to power. The highchair king from Fifth Avenue would exult in his victimhood and energise his always-ready-to-be aggrieved followers. It could also lead to Democrats losing the House as their moderates fall and help Republicans hold the Senate. No Republicans would vote for impeaching Trump, and some Democrats might refuse as well. Even if the House acted, Mitch McConnell would smother it in the Senate, just like he did Merrick Garland.It’s better to pull out Trump by the roots in the election and firmly repudiate him. The Democrats should focus on the future, not the benighted past that we have been relegated to under Trump. Hillary Clinton’s campaign focused on what a terrible person Trump is. It turned out that enough voters knew that and didn’t care. They wanted a racist Rottweiler. Now the Democrats are once more focused on what a terrible person Trump is.Message received, many times over.The progressives’ cry that they don’t care about the political consequences because they have a higher cause is just a purity racket. Their mantra is like that of Ferdinand I, the Holy Roman Emperor: “Fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus.” “Let justice be done, though the world perish.”The rest of us more imperfect beings don’t want the world to perish. And maybe justice can be done, without losing the White House, the House, chocolate, high heels, parties and fun."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Airbnb host who sub-let council flat to repay £100,000 Atheist parents take primary school to court as they say assembly prayers  breach children’s human rightsEmployment tribunal claimants are waiting 18 months before their case is being heard due to backlog, lawyers warnNHS will not be put up for sale, Liz Truss to warn USDonald Trump escalates row over \u0026#39rat infested\u0026#39 Baltimore and its representative Elijah CummingsDonald Trump \u0026#39richly deserves\u0026#39 to be impeached, says top Democrat on House committeeBoris Johnson to unveil biggest ad campaign since Second World War to prepare for \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Meghan Markle guest edits September edition of British VogueBoris Johnson will vow to \u0026#39unleash the productive power\u0026#39 of every corner of the UKMan trapped by rocks as incoming tide reached his neck saved after four-hour ordealComment: I\u0026#39m ready to make a US trade deal happenFamilies of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Matthew Hedges call on Boris Johnson to create legal duty to protect British nationals overseasComment: Varadkar can blame Britain all he likes – but he is the real threat to peace\tDan Coats, intelligence chief who clashed with Donald Trump, \u0026#39to step down\u0026#39Dominic Cummings\u0026#39 \u0026#39one strike and you\u0026#39re out\u0026#39 ban on Cabinet leaks is leaked to Daily Dozens of migrants still stuck on vessel in Italy port Fears over Muslim parents withdrawing children from \u0026#39non-halal\u0026#39 flu vaccineItalian police launch investigation into picture showing blindfolded US suspect in Rome police murderBrazil miners kill tribal leader in Amazon land invasion Aristocrat claims his family has evicted him and his pregnant wife from family seatAll you can drink cruise packages criticised by P\u0026ampO passengers as police rule out clown as brawl perpetratorWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best telegraph audio smartphones making us less productive green","story":"The best of The  in audioEvery Friday the  will bring you a selection of our best articles, comment pieces and features in audio form to be listened to at your convenience.Here are this week\u0027s recordings.

That\u0027s why it\u0027s important to get these claims dealt with quickly, but at current trend employment tribunals will soon reach breaking point.Eight-month delays are just not sustainable and can be very challenging for both parties involved. On this kind of timeline, it is not uncommon for key witnesses to leave, move to other roles or countries, and memories can also fade.A severe lack of resources means delays are endemic across the whole tribunals system - even when calling the employment tribunals inquiries helpline, you can be waiting for hours.If no material increase in funding arises then authorities may need to look at more creative solutions. Options put forward include introducing a new step in the tribunals process which gives both parties a chance to settle before a case is heard in court.A Courts \u0026amp Tribunals Service spokesman said: We are making every effort to refund these fees and have written directly to everybody we think is eligible - some 43,000 people. More than half of the money owed has already been paid out, and we\u0027re working closely with stakeholders to get the message out even further.Airbnb host who sub-let council flat to repay £100,000 Atheist parents take primary school to court as they say assembly prayers  breach children’s human rightsNHS will not be put up for sale, Liz Truss to warn USDonald Trump escalates row over \u0026#39rat infested\u0026#39 Baltimore and its representative Elijah CummingsDonald Trump \u0026#39richly deserves\u0026#39 to be impeached, says top Democrat on House committeeBoris Johnson to unveil biggest ad campaign since Second World War to prepare for \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Meghan Markle guest edits September edition of British VogueBoris Johnson will vow to \u0026#39unleash the productive power\u0026#39 of every corner of the UKMan trapped by rocks as incoming tide reached his neck saved after four-hour ordealComment: I\u0026#39m ready to make a US trade deal happenFamilies of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Matthew Hedges call on Boris Johnson to create legal duty to protect British nationals overseasComment: Varadkar can blame Britain all he likes – but he is the real threat to peace\tDan Coats, intelligence chief who clashed with Donald Trump, \u0026#39to step down\u0026#39Dominic Cummings\u0026#39 \u0026#39one strike and you\u0026#39re out\u0026#39 ban on Cabinet leaks is leaked to Daily Dozens of migrants still stuck on vessel in Italy port Fears over Muslim parents withdrawing children from \u0026#39non-halal\u0026#39 flu vaccineItalian police launch investigation into picture showing blindfolded US suspect in Rome police murderBrazil miners kill tribal leader in Amazon land invasion Aristocrat claims his family has evicted him and his pregnant wife from family seatAll you can drink cruise packages criticised by P\u0026ampO passengers as police rule out clown as brawl perpetratorBritish woman who alleged gang rape in Cyprus arrested on suspicion of making a false allegationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/28/TELEMMGLPICT000205061520_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBk7tlT-H1lVFMLFxGgyq39FvNDswQBtmVH3SQbpIcuE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"man trapped rocks incoming tide reached neck saved four hour","story":"Norfolk Police, Norfolk Fire and Rescue and the East of England Ambulance Service were at the scene of the successful rescue alongside Sheringham RNLIFire and Rescue ServiceRescue teams had to cut through rocks in a desperate bid to save a trapped man as water from the incoming tide reached his neck. The man, in his 20s, reportedly became stuck after rescuing a toddler from the water near the East Promenade in Sheringham, Norfolk, on Sunday.He was freed four hours after he trapped his leg in rocks at about 5.30pm.Emergency services were called and a co-ordinated rescue effort led by Cromer and Sheringham coastguard managed to save him after the water rose up to his neck at high tide.He was given a life jacket and breathing apparatus as his rescuers held his head above water while cutting through the rocks trapping him on the beach.How to listen - Chopper\u0026#039s Brexit podcastNorfolk Police, Norfolk Fire and Rescue and the East of England Ambulance Service were at the scene alongside Sheringham RNLI.The Coastguard tweeted: The news we\u0027ve been waiting for: Man trapped in rocks at Sheringham has been rescued. AllSafe Well done to everyone involved.Sam Stockdale, senior maritime operations officer from HM Coastguard, said: It\u0027s such good news that this man has been freed. We often talk about how training matters between the various frontline responders and today has shown just why it does.Everyone worked together on scene to look after the man and also to free him as soon as was practically possible.Emergency services at the sceneWitness Lissy Jackson said:  I saw a number of rescue workers at the scene, all crowded round the rocks attempting to free the man.He had an injuredtrapped leg so they did not have much success. I later then saw 2 large trucks pull in, with equipment to aid in breaking to rocks to break the man free.Harry Weaver, a Sheringham resident who lives close to the promenade, said he had seen a specialist Hazardous Area Response Team (HART) ambulance heading towards the scene shortly after 8pm.He added: The incident itself is blocked from view, I just saw the coastguard fly down at first followed by fire, ambulance and later more specialist fire appliances.The man is now being cared for by the East of England Ambulance Service, and no details have been given of his age, or where he is from.Retired Coastguard station manager Stuart Facey told the North Norfolk News he was walking his dog when the Coastguard arrived.I saw someone obviously stuck in the rocks, it was high tide and water was coming over him so it was a very scary situation, he said.I\u0027ve seen people climb into the cavities in the rocks and the problem is that even if you are able to move a rock to free someone who is stuck, another can fall into its place, it can be a life or death situation.Earlier Zach Pedley, from HM Coastguard, said: This is a very frightening experience for this man.Thankfully someone knew to call 999 and ask for the Coastguard which meant we could send the right response immediately. Everyone is working together at the scene to keep him calm and safe.Fire and Rescue ServiceAirbnb host who sub-let council flat to repay £100,000 Atheist parents take primary school to court as they say assembly prayers  breach children’s human rightsEmployment tribunal claimants are waiting 18 months before their case is being heard due to backlog, lawyers warnNHS will not be put up for sale, Liz Truss to warn USDonald Trump escalates row over \u0026#39rat infested\u0026#39 Baltimore and its representative Elijah CummingsDonald Trump \u0026#39richly deserves\u0026#39 to be impeached, says top Democrat on House committeeBoris Johnson to unveil biggest ad campaign since Second World War to prepare for \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Meghan Markle guest edits September edition of British VogueBoris Johnson will vow to \u0026#39unleash the productive power\u0026#39 of every corner of the UKComment: I\u0026#39m ready to make a US trade deal happenFamilies of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Matthew Hedges call on Boris Johnson to create legal duty to protect British nationals overseasComment: Varadkar can blame Britain all he likes – but he is the real threat to peace\tDan Coats, intelligence chief who clashed with Donald Trump, \u0026#39to step down\u0026#39Dominic Cummings\u0026#39 \u0026#39one strike and you\u0026#39re out\u0026#39 ban on Cabinet leaks is leaked to Daily Dozens of migrants still stuck on vessel in Italy port Fears over Muslim parents withdrawing children from \u0026#39non-halal\u0026#39 flu vaccineItalian police launch investigation into picture showing blindfolded US suspect in Rome police murderBrazil miners kill tribal leader in Amazon land invasion Aristocrat claims his family has evicted him and his pregnant wife from family seatAll you can drink cruise packages criticised by P\u0026ampO passengers as police rule out clown as brawl perpetratorBritish woman who alleged gang rape in Cyprus arrested on suspicion of making a false allegationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/28/TELEMMGLPICT000205024814_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqtQHinCGUHYgAj9jcjv0eYaUY1wZ5V0z4mAgnFJQnDB4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"meghan markle guest edits september edition british vogue","story":"The Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s Vogue coverDuchess of SussexDiana, Princess of Wales was deemed the ultimate Vogue cover girl and the Duchess of Cambridge followed in her footsteps.But the Duchess of Sussex has gone one step further, shunning the honour to focus on female empowerment and ersity.In becoming the first person to guest edit the prestigious September issue of British Vogue, she has instead chosen to make 15 other women cover stars, using the opportunity to promote inspirational role models who are leading the charge in everything from mental health to politics.The Duchess has spent the last seven months secretly working on the forthcoming edition of the fashion bible, it was revealed on Sunday night.She has carefully curated an issue that focuses on her choice of “trailblazing changemakers” entitled Forces for Change.It will include a “candid conversation” between the Duchess and Michelle Obama, the former First Lady, whom she has long admired, as well as an interview between her husband, the Duke of Sussex and Dr Jane Goodall, a primatologist whom she has idolised since childhood.The Duchess with one of her cover stars, New Zealand\u0026#39s Prime Minister Jacinda ArdernThe issue will also include a feature on Smart Works, the charity for which the Duchess is patron, and a lengthy editor\u0027s letter in which she is expected to detail how the assignment came about.The Duchess has been heavily involved in every decision, her involvement reflected on “every single page,” insiders revealed.She said: “These last seven months have been a rewarding process, curating and collaborating with Edward Enninful, British Vogue’s editor-in-chief, to take the year’s most read fashion issue and steer its focus to the values, causes and people making impact in the world today.“Through this lens I hope you’ll feel the strength of the collective in the erse selection of women chosen for the cover as well as the team of support I called upon within the issue to help bring this to light. I hope readers feel as inspired as I do, by the ‘Forces for Change’ they’ll find within these pages.”While it was the Duchess’s idea to feature 15 women on the cover, the 37-year-old eschewed the chance to appear alongside them as she deemed it “boastful” for this particular project.Instead, she identified a group of women she personally admired and felt “very strongly” about, some of whom she has met in the last year or two.The Duchess of Cambridge with Irish activist Sinead Burke, one of her Vogue cover starsThey include Adwoa Aboah, a mental health campaigner and model whom the Duchess appeared alongside on a panel marking International Women’s Day in March and Jameela Jamil, a body positivity advocate and actor whose Instagram account was one of a small selection recently highlighted by the Sussex’s.Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who hosted the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their first joint overseas tour last October and said she had “real empathy” for the then-pregnant royal, also features, as does Sinead Burke, an Irish ersity activist who met the Duchess at a garden party in Dublin last July and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the novelist who hosted a talk with Michelle Obama attended by the Duchess in December.Others she has chosen to celebrate are Adut Akech, a South Sudanese model and former refugee, Ramla Ali, a London-based Somali boxer, Gemma Chan, a Kent-born campaigner and actor and Laverne Cox, the transgender activist and actor who stars in Orange is the New Black.The inclusion of Jane Fonda, the American actor and political activist, was likely inspired by the 2018 documentary Feminists: What Were They Thinking? which the Duchess referenced earlier this year after watching it on Netflix.The other women featured are Salma Hayek Pinault, the actor and women’s rights advocate, Francesca Hayward, the Kenyan-borm Royal Ballet principal dancer who stars in the remake of Cats, Greta Thunberg, the climate change campaigner, Christy Turlington Burns, the model and campaigner against maternal deaths and Yara Shahidi, the American actor and founder of Eighteen x 18, which is focused on engaging young people in politics.The September issue of British VogueThe 16th spot on the cover has been left blank, at the Duchess’s request, to represent a mirror designed to “include the reader and encourage them to use their own platforms to effect change.” The Duchess of Cambridge appeared on the cover of Vogue in 2016 to celebrate its centenary, in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery.She was the most senior royal to grace the cover since Diana, Princess of Wales, who featured four times, including a posthumous appearance in October 1997.The Princess Royal also appeared on the magazine\u0027s cover, in 1971. The Queen, the Duke of Windsor, the Prince of Wales and Princess Margaret have also featured inside.Mr Enninful said he was “delighted” that the Duchess had become the first person to guest edit the September issue, traditionally the biggest and best-selling and heralding the start of the fashion season.“To have the country’s most influential beacon of change guest edit British Vogue at this time has been an honour,  a pleasure and a wonderful surprise,” he said.“As you will see from her selections throughout this magazine, she is also willing to wade into more complex and nuanced areas, whether they concern female empowerment, mental health, race or privilege. “From the very beginning, we talked about the cover - whether she would be on it or not.  In the end, she felt that it would be in some ways a ‘boastful’ thing to do for this particular project. She wanted, instead, to focus on the women she admires.”In 2009, a documentary film called The September Issue gave a behind the scenes look as US editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington worked together on the 2007 US edition of the magazine.Duchess of SussexThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Jaden, 15, will share £1.8m with his playing partnerThe mother of a British schoolboy who won almost £1 million in the Fortnite World Cup has said that she tried to hard to stop him from playing the game that she threw out his Xbox and snapped his headset.Jaden Ashman, 15, will split £1.8 million in prize money with his Dutch team-mate after winning second place in the Fortnite duos competition at the Athur Ashe stadium in New York City, which traditionally hosts the US Open tennis tournament.The teenager from Essex, who competes under the name Wolfiez, was among 100 Fortnite players who qualified for the game\u0027s first ever world cup, in which a total of more than £24 million is up for grabs with a top inidual prize of £2.4 million.But his mother, Lisa Dallman, said she didn\u0027t really know much about video games and had struggled to accept that his skill at Fortnite was more than a frivolous waste of time.It\u0027s not been a straightfoward journey with Jaden, Ms Dallman told BBC Five Live. If I\u0027m honest with you, I\u0027ve been quite against him gaming. I\u0027ve been more pushing him to his schoolwork. I\u0027ve actually thrown an Xbox out, snapped a headset, we\u0027ve had a nightmare.Leading up to the game, getting his visa, we had problems with that... then the dog ate his birth certificate. Then work messed up my wages. So three things went wrong before we started heading here.I had a feeling that Jaden was going to place top 10... he\u0027s come 2nd and I can\u0027t believe it.More than 100 players representing more than 30 countries competed in Fortnite\u0027s first World Cup, which is attempting to turn the game\u0027s massive international popularity into a glitzy competitive sport. The £24m prize pool is currently the biggest ever offered for any eSports event, though it is likely to be surpassed by the Dota 2 International in August.Ashman surprised many fans on Saturday by winning second place by using a joypad rather than a keyboard and mouse, which allow for finer control.Me and my mum, we clash quite a lot, he said after the tournament. She didn\u0027t understand how it worked, so she thought that I was spending eight hours a day in my room just wasting my time. Mow that I\u0027ve proved to her that I can do stuff, I\u0027m really happy.Other Brits also placed well in the duos tournament. Kyle Mongraal Jackson, 14, who became the youngest ever eSports player when he was recruited by a team aged 13, won half of £363,000 with 6th place, while Mac Itemm Gillivray came just behind him at 8th place.Altogether, British players won almost $1.4 million, with more money likely to flow from the singles tournament, in which Jackson and his fellow Brit Benjy David Fish (Benjyfishy) are tipped to place well. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

healthy dose of risk-taking has helped her business flourishClick to followThe IndependentIf\u0026nbspa film were to be made about Kiki McDonough’s life, it would likely prove a hit at box offices across the country. The 64-year-old embodies everything we love to celebrate about British entrepreneurialism and commerce. And it’s a story like hers that would provide welcome relief from the tales of misconduct and poor governance – of arrogance and greed – which these days seem to dominate the business pages.McDonough’s biopic would be about ambition, hard work and a healthy dose of risk. But above all it would be about humble success: few jewellers can claim to have their pieces in the permanent collection of London’s Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum. Even fewer can say that their designs are favoured by several generations of royals. But almost none would be able to tell you all that without sounding even just a little bit boastful. This charming mother of two from Battersea is one of the few.On a muggy Friday morning in June, I meet McDonough in the basement of her eponymous flagship store, just off London’s chic Sloane Square. The term “basement” really doesn’t do the space justice. Carpeted in soft pastels, and with a huge sofa covered in cushions, the light and breezy room is a seamless extension of the shop upstairs, decor-wise. It serves as an atelier-cum-office-cum-lounge for McDonough’s team, and as I take a seat I can’t help but feel like I’ve been invited over to a very stylish, very classy friend’s house for tea.\u0026nbspMcDonough is a fifth-generation jeweller and her immaculate taste and eye for all things beautiful could have been inherited from either of her parents. Her father owned an antique jewellery shop off Bond Street and prior to having children her mother ran fashion shows at Paris’ Galeries Lafayette. Initially, though, McDonough didn’t seem destined for a creative career. After completing her A-levels at Queen’s Gate School in Kensington, where – she casually drops into conversation – she was taught English by Eliza Manningham-Buller, who later served as director general of MI5, she attended secretarial college\u0026nbspand took an admin job in the offices of Vogue.“I did what girls my age were doing at the time. But it was in the 1980s that I had what I call my lucky break,” she explains, sipping her coffee, long legs elegantly crossed at the ankles, and smiling at the memory a little coyly.Kiki McDonough on Symons Street at this year’s Chelsea in Bloom, London’s largest free flower festival in London (Matt AlexanderPA WirePA Images)“A friend of mine had an antique jewellery shop on Grafton Street in Mayfair. He called me up one day out of the blue and asked if I wanted to design and sell modern jewellery for him. I thought it was a totally mad idea, but my then-husband, David, encouraged me to give it a go.”And so, in 1985, Kiki McDonough the company was incorporated. In the founder’s own words, her first baby was born. With no design experience, she sat at her desk on day one, staring at a blank piece of paper with a pencil in hand. “I was clueless. The only thought going through my head was that this is completely bonkers,” she says with a laugh. But as it turns out, it wasn’t really as crazy as she suspected.\u0026nbspGavanGetty)The first pair of earnings McDonough ever designed – crystal hearts topped with gold bows – were inspired by an antique brooch she’d spotted in her friend’s collection. They now have pride of place in the permanent collection at the V\u0026ampA, and even though they were created some 34 years ago, their style is echoed in many subsequent collections, including those that have caught the eye of royals.In the mid-1990s, Diana, Princess of Wales, wore a pair of McDonough’s earrings to meet Barbara Bush. Over the last decade, scores of glossies have vied for snapshots of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in McDonough’s creations. In March, the Express splashed a story claiming that the Duchess has over £47,000 worth of jewellery from the brand. But ever the professional businesswoman, exuding poise and grace, McDonough is not about to be roused such reports, accurate or not.\u0026nbsp“Of course it’s flattering that she likes my pieces, but what really gives me pleasure is when I walk down the street and pass someone wearing one of my items,” she says. “That unexpectedness – that’s what really gets me out of bed in the morning.”Our conversation mid-flow, I suddenly get distracted by an elderly lady in a striking suede coat with dazzling blue earrings who’s quietly entered the room and is now shuffling past us. I quizzically look at McDonough. “This is my mother,” she says with a touch of pride. “She’s 95 and quite deaf, but she works for me one day a week stringing necklaces. She’s always supported me. In 1989 she took over the shop when I had chickenpox.”From everything that I’ve seen and heard, there’s no doubt that while McDonough success is obviously her own doing, support from her friends and family has been paramount to her ability to stay resilient and devoted despite the testing ups and downs of running a company.Of course it’s flattering that she likes my pieces, but what really gives me pleasure is when I walk down the street and pass someone wearing one of my items. That unexpectedness – that’s what really gets me out of bed in the morningThough neither of her sons, now aged 25 and 27, work in the industry, she says that from a very young age she made sure that they understood what she did, and appreciated that it was her hard work that allowed them to lead a comfortable life. She also speaks fondly of both her ex-husbands and describes how fortunate she was to have found partners that understood and promoted her passion.\u0026nbspThe business has just had its most successful year ever and as questioning turns to the future, McDonough says she’s confident that she can continue to expand in the years to come. Beyond her Chelsea shop, she distributes through some of the best-known department stores, including Fortnum \u0026amp Mason in London, and Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus in the US. But it’s online where she sees the greatest potential for growth. Though the UK remains her dominant market, about 35 per cent of sales already go to the US and the brand has a strong following in Canada, Australia and Asia, predominantly because of the internet.\u0026nbspHer international resonance and success might be at least partly attributable to the variety of her collections. Many of her pieces are elegantly understated with intricate florals and delicate pastel hues – “jewellery for everyday”, as she calls it – but others are show-stopping, unapologetic statement features in radiant greens, reds and blues.That spectrum means that she’s loved by women of all demographics and backgrounds, seeking jewellery for all\u0026nbspoccasions. And while prices are certainly not cheap, it’s always been the business’s mission to make beautiful, high quality products available at a price point that’s affordable to as many as possible. Prices currently range from a few hundred pounds to several thousand.Why women don’t need a science degree to be successfulSpotify for textbooks: Inside the revolutionary new book shopAs the interview draws to a close, I can’t help but mention a delicate gold bracelet that I’d seen some months ago and then spotted again on my way downstairs to meet McDonough. “Oh yes, I know the one you mean. It would really suit you.” Of course she’d say that.\u0026nbspA few minutes later – my wallet a little lighter – I step out into a now sun-drenched Sloane Square admiring my birthday present to myself and silently vowing not to make a habit of bringing my credit card to interviews with jewellery designers in future.\u0026nbspBut Kiki McDonough’s charm really did win me over. There might’ve been a more economical way of finding whether she’s a good saleswoman too, but a little indulgence is sometimes necessary. I’m sure Kiki would agree.A View from the Top\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspDuchess of Cambridge\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The challenge has been limp indeed.\u0026nbspThere was no government or EU involvement in  Bank, which was once the little bank that could, with its free dog biscuits and seven-day town centre branches. It\u0026nbsprode a wave of goodwill when it was set up by Vernon Hill and Anthony Thomson. They promised a bank where the customer was king and\u0026nbspso it has mostly proved, with the bank regularly topping service surveys.\u0026nbspBut confidence in the institution has been dented by a regulatory foul-up and a spate of damaging rumours on social media.It has lost deposits and last week announced that profits had crashed. A big book of mortgages was sold and the search for a replacement for Hill as chair\u0026nbspis under way.\u0026nbspThomson went on to form Atom, an app-based outfit in the northeast, which recently raised another £50m from investors. The most recent accounts showed that it’s still losing a bunch of money and the prospect of a sale to one of its big backers\u0026nbsphas been killed off by Brexit. High-profile money manager Neil Woodford was among those who ponied up. His name on the shareholder register used to be viewed as a good sign. In the wake of the suspension of dealings in his\u0026nbspflagship fund, however, that’s no longer true.\u0026nbspTSB started off well after being spun out of Lloyds. It enjoyed a successful flotation and was subsequently gobbled up by Spain’s Banco Sabadell. But much of its early good work was trashed after it had its reputation shredded by an IT meltdown last year.\u0026nbspWilliams \u0026amp Glyn, the business-focussed bank that was supposed to emerge from RBS, never got out of the starting blocks. The bank ultimately worked out a deal with the EU to provide funding for existing competitors in the business banking space.\u0026nbspTesco Bank, meanwhile, recently sold its mortgage book and walked away from what has become a brutally competitive market.\u0026nbspThere’s really no common theme running through the difficulties these businesses have\u0026nbspencountered. Their stories really\u0026nbspjust serve to demonstrate how hard it is to get new banking businesses to fly when faced by four or five very big, well-established players.\u0026nbspFar from providing extra competition to them, the challengers are starting to find themselves being outcompeted. The ring-fenced retail banking arms of the leading banks, with their fat capital cushions, have, for example, stormed into the mortgage market brandishing cheap rates that customers have flocked to, HSBC in particular.\u0026nbspIt should be said at this point that not all smaller banks are struggling, a point made by Investec’s banking analyst Ian Gordon.\u0026nbspHe highlights the success enjoyed by\u0026nbsp“specialist banks”\u0026nbspsuch as OneSavings, Charter Court, and Paragon, which “are having a fantastic time”. But they are businesses which have become winners\u0026nbspby exporting particular niches\u0026nbspthat the big banks aren’t\u0026nbspvery good at serving. Full-service challengers they are not.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

The bank, as we know it today, was created by bolting together CYBG, the owner of the Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks that weren’t making particularly eye-catching progress before the deal, and the former Virgin, which was built from the good bits of Northern Rock Richard Branson bought from the government for a song.

Apple\u0027s model\u0026nbspis still expected to arrive next year, but the first of them will likely rely on modem chips made by Qualcomm.But, after that, Apple is expected to use the people and patents it acquired through the Intel acquisition to create new kinds of modems for its own iPhones, in line with what has become a central commitment for the company.Under the deal, about 2,200 Intel employees will join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases.\u0026nbspApple will then\u0026nbsphave 17,000 wireless technology patents, ranging from cellular communication standards to modems, making it a more powerful player in the global licensing talks that will likely be held by major 5G patent holders such as Huawei Technologies.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018After the deal, Intel will retain the right to develop modems for non-smartphone applications, such as PCs, industrial equipment and self-driving cars.New iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakModem chips connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks, but Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for the part. Intel has positioned itself as the sole source of iPhone modem chips over the past year after Apple got into a prolonged legal fight with previous supplier Qualcomm over patent licensing practices.Apple, based in\u0026nbspCupertino, California,\u0026nbspreached a surprise settlement in April that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips. Within hours, Intel said it would quit the smartphone modem business.Apple’s acquisitions have mostly been much smaller companies, making the Intel deal its second-largest ever after its $3.2bn purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014.The deal with Intel will bolster Apple’s goal to make its own modem chip. Two of Apple’s biggest global rivals – Samsung Electronics and Huawei – already have the ability to self-supply modem chips.Technology news publication The Information last year reported Apple’s efforts to develop its own modem, but the iPhone maker\u0026nbspnever formally acknowledged it. In February, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signalling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.Apple chief executive Tim Cook has also long said the company wants to control its own technological fate – analysts call this\u0026nbspthe “Cook Doctrine”.“We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make,” Tim Cook told investors back in 2009.The purchase of Intel’s assets could help Apple meet its aggressive timeline for producing a modem.A person familiar with the matter said Apple plans to use Qualcomm’s modem technology for a 5G iPhone in 2020 but wants to have its own ready for use\u0026nbspby 2021.But any replacement of Qualcomm is likely to happen in phases, this person said, as Apple builds up its ability to ensure that its modems work on all the networks and countries where it sells phones. Ensuring worldwide compatibility is Qualcomm’s historical strength, and Apple might still have to rely on the firm\u0026nbspfor some modems during a transition period to its own devices.“There’s a fierce desire (at Apple) to have independence, but they also realise it has to be done responsibly,” this person said.Apple’s licence deal with Qualcomm lasts six years and its accompanying chip supply agreement could also last that long, said one chip industry veteran who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Apple is likely to continue to use the San Diego firm’s chips in its flagship models even if it phases in its own silicon for lower-end and older models, this person said.Apple has engaged with Taiwan’s Global Unichip Corp, a chip design house in which Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is an investor, to explore a modem design, but the work is in early stages.“Clearly Apple saw the handwriting on the wall, because they came around and did a deal with Qualcomm,” this person said.Apple declined to comment on its plans, and Qualcomm and Global Unichip did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The most valuable aspect of the Intel deal for Apple could turn out to be patents. To sell a 5G iPhone, Apple will need to strike deals with the major holders of 5G patents, including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Qualcomm. Apple executed a licensing deal with Qualcomm, but it has not disclosed whether it has deals in place with the others.Erick Robinson, a patent attorney who had worked in Qualcomm’s licensing ision in Asia, said the patents could give Apple better leverage in licensing talks.“I don’t think Intel has quite the portfolio that Qualcomm has, but they certainly have a large enough one to impact the valuations when it comes to a cross-licensing deal,” he said. “It’ll save (Apple) a huge chunk of change in cross-licence deals.”Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But his\u0026nbspdream of\u0026nbspsaving\u0026nbspthe planet’s coral wasn’t forgotten.\u0026nbspA team of satellite mappers, marine scientists and naturalists\u0026nbspbegan\u0026nbspmapping\u0026nbspand monitoring all the world’s reefs – resulting in the\u0026nbspAllen Coral Atlas. At a recent presentation in Seattle, they\u0026nbsprevealed that while they had tracked just 2 per cent of the world’s coral, they\u0026nbsphoped to have completed the task by the end of 2020.Created with Sketch.Coral reefs: Trying to combat climate change damage Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Masked Butterflyfish (Chaetodon semilarvatus) swimming over a bommie reef in the Egyptian Red Sea marine reserve of Ras Mohamed, off the southern tip of the Sinai peninsulaRising sea temperatures cause corals to bleach (go white) and dieA giant clam is seen nestled among coral reefs at the Obhor coast, 30 kms north of the Red Sea city of Jeddah425 Coral reef in seychelles that has degradedAfter the reef has died they break up and become rubble.

This monitoring system\u0026nbspmeans that when\u0026nbspcrises hit, such as bleaching\u0026nbspor shipwrecks, local authorities and conservationists will be able to act quickly.“This is game-changing,” says Greg Asner, director of Arizona State University’s centre for global discovery and conservation science. “I’ve been doing this for 25 years. Until two years ago, we would get an image and then we’d unpack it, and spend\u0026nbspmonths and even years trying to determine what was going on on the sea floor.”Asner says\u0026nbspthere was a recent\u0026nbspincident in one of the northern areas of the Marshall Islands where a tanker\u0026nbspran aground, a long way from where the authorities were based in the south.“The first image of this happening was from our project,” he says. “I had colleagues there, and they took the picture to the environmental agency,\u0026nbspand they found that the tanker had spilled a large amount of fuel oil. The process for them was how them to mitigate that. But we had the image, the next day.”He says anywhere up to a billion\u0026nbsppeople depend directly on coral for their livelihoods, but that even larger numbers benefit from their association with fisheries and the breaking of storm surges.\u0026nbspA report published earlier this year by the UN about challenges to bioersity\u0026nbspwarned that up to a million\u0026nbspspecies were threatened with extinction. It said around one third of reef-forming corals were at risk.“Bioersity and nature’s contributions to people are our common heritage and humanity’s most important life-supporting safety net,” warned Sandra\u0026nbspDiaz, a renowned Argentine ecologist who co-chaired the report. “But our safety net is stretched almost to breaking point.”The images used by Asner and others\u0026nbspare provided by Planet Labs, a California-based company that operates 120 satellites\u0026nbspto provide almost real-time images. The new images provided by the latest generation of satellites – lighter, smaller and cheaper – means Planet Labs\u0026nbspcan detect deforestation, the growth of cities, sea ice, and even the spread of camps for\u0026nbsprefugees or\u0026nbspinternally displaced people.Andrew Zolli, the company’s vice president of global impact, says the team is fond of saying: “You can’t save something you cannot see.”\u0026nbsp“These problems tend to be remote from our everyday experience,” he says.\u0026nbsp“We hand these data sets to scientists,” Zolli\u0026nbspadds. “The challenge is how to turn big data into action.”The map being produced for the coral atlas\u0026nbspwill comprise\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsphighest resolution images of the world’s reefs seen so far.“What we know about the coral reefs is\u0026nbspthat they are under tremendous stress, specifically from climate change and human development. Yet\u0026nbspno high-resolution\u0026nbspmap of the world’s coral reefs exists,” he says.“Less than a hundredth\u0026nbspof 1 per cent of the world’s reefs are actively monitored for change, and when they are, they’re monitored using methods that would have been familiar to the Wright brothers. People go up in planes and literally estimate the extent of things such as coral bleaching.”He adds: “We’re using an early 20th-century solution to deal with a global\u0026nbsp21st-century problem, and we’re failing at it badly.”Allen, who died last October and was said to have a fortune of more than $20bn\u0026nbsp(£16bn) at the time of death, did not have an entirely seamless relationship with the oceans. In January 2016, it was reported that one of his yachts, the 303ft MV Tatoosh, unintentionally destroyed a large part of a coral reef in the Cayman Islands\u0026nbspwith its anchor chain.Coral gardening: The front line in the fight against climate change?Endangered green turtles increasing in numbers, study showsAustralia floods pose ‘freshwater bleaching’ risk to vulnerable coralsRuth Gates: Marine biologist who worked on breeding a ‘super coral’A spokesperson for Vulcan said\u0026nbspat the time that Allen was not in the Caribbean when the incident took place, and questioned the reported scale of the damage the accident caused.A Vulcan spokesperson told The Independent: “It was never determined that the coral injury in the Cayman Islands was caused by the Tatoosh, as there was a long history of incidents in that location. Regardless, in 2016, Vulcan quickly commissioned leading experts in coral and reef restoration to rebuild, protect and preserve the local ecosystem for generations to come.”Helen Fox has the task of using the data produced by the Allen-inspired project and working with local communities. She says sometimes\u0026nbspthey are able to piggyback on existing projects sometimes they start new initiatives.\u0026nbspThey also work with conservationists and students to e and take images pegged to a GPS tracker, to help validate the maps produced the satellites.Fox, a senior director at the National Geographic Society, says the goal “is to have a network of engaged users who can receive alerts if there are bleaching events or ship groundings”.She says the unique aspect of the project is the speed with which it provides images, matched with its global scale.“We’ve never had anything like that before,” she says. “It just opens up whole new avenues of possibility.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another flame flew out of the top of the rocket, as can be seen on the video.The rocket itself appeared to survive without problems, but it is just the latest in a run of issues. It came a week after the Starhopper craft flew a fireball out of its bottom during another test.It was the first time that SpaceX has allowed one of the tests to be streamed.

Company results usually come out at 7am, but by 8am on Friday, when the stock market opened, the results were still missing, all planned calls with the media and analysts were cancelled and a presentation to investors at the retailer’s London head office was scrapped.A spokesman for Sports Direct said: “Unfortunately we are still finalising preliminary results.

People took to the streets on Sunday to protest a proposed amendment to the extradition law that protesters fear would allow Hong Kong citizens to be unfairly extradited to ChinaI understand that media and other governments are putting on pressure. We are pinning our hopes on the ongoing diplomatic efforts. So far the Iranian\u0026nbspauthorities have given the crew no\u0026nbspindication about a release, he added.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHis son said the crew were really terrified when the Iranian security forces first\u0026nbspapproached the boat and took control of the vessel.He said they came in helicopters and seized the ship. After the initial panic, the crew understood that they have been taken into custody and will not be harmed in any way.They are all doing fine and appear to be being treated well by Iranian authorities. He said several Iranian\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspwere on the vessel and all crew members were allowed to talk to their family members for a few minutes.”\u0026nbspThe Stena Impero was detained\u0026nbspalong with 23 crew members who are of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality.The shipping company released a statement on Thursday saying: Stena Bulk and Northern Marine Management continue to hold dialogue with all the governments and authorities directly involved in order to secure the release of crew and vessel.We await a decision from the local authorities on our request to attend the vessel,” it added.The news came as a report from Iran\u0027s semi-official Tasnim news agency claimed the UK sent a mediator to the country to discuss the freeing of the tanker, but this was later denied by senior foreign office sources.\u0026nbspOn Wednesday, Iran\u0027s president, Hassan Rouhani, suggested that Stena Impero could be released if Britain takes similar steps to hand back an Iranian oil tanker seized by the Royal Navy off Gibraltar earlier this month.Crew of British oil tanker captured by Iran are \u0027safe\u0027Iran rejects UK proposal for international maritime coalitionThe Iran crisis leaves the UK in a precarious positionJeremy Hunt announces joint European task force to protect UK shipsPompeo says ‘responsibility falls to UK to take care of its ships’The British Department for Transport announced on Thursday that it would be offering Royal Navy escort for British-flagged ships travelling through the strategic water way.\u0026nbspMr Pappachan said Dijo had only joined the boat from Gujarat, western India, a month before it was seized, and had little idea about the dangers of operating in the Strait of Hormuz.\u0026nbspThe family found out the\u0026nbspvessel had been taken when they received\u0026nbspa phone call from the Swedish company that owns the tanker.\u0026nbspIt was completely unexpected that his ship will be seized. I honestly did not know the seriousness of the crisis, I don’t think he did either. We were shocked. the father said.\u0026nbspAll of the crew had gone to eke out a living. It is the responsibility of all governments to ensure their safety, the father added.As any father, I want my son to safely return home. But it is not only about my son.

One Labour MP predicts Boris will “wipe the floor” with Corbyn.Panic has set in with Irish leader Leo Varadkar too, ramping up his rhetoric now we have a PM who means business.No Deal will cause Dublin such chaos that the EU intends to let them waive border checks. So much for the “backstop” being vital to avoid a hard border. In the end they’ll just make checks away from the border, as Eurosceptics said.Our new Cabinet, meanwhile, fizzes with energy and resolve. Long may it last.And while a suicide squad of Tory Remoaners may still fancy forcing an election to avoid No Deal, that threat looks far less potent than a week ago.WE despair of our police.Yes, they are short-staffed. That is obviously partly to blame for kne crime soaring to record highs. We back the , cops the Tories aim to recruit.But then “hard-pressed” bobbies build a huge tower of hats in a juvenile social media contest. And the Met commissions a spray-painter to daub a nick with cartoons bearing banal messages.Some forces have given up on burglaries, blaming cuts. The Met often seems to have given up on even more serious crime. Yet the stunts and virtue-signalling keep coming. And police chiefs seem too dim to grasp how bad it looks.New policing minister Kit Malthouse is focused on recruitment. But he must also lay down the law about ato basic crime-fighting and detection.Plus a ban on social media posts that do nothing for the public but enrage it.IT began with Jews. Now Labour’s race hatred extends to black and ethnic minority people who vote the “wrong” way.Look how they are targeting BAME Cabinet members. Clive Lewis MP, an acolyte of anti-Semite Corbyn, tells black Tory chairman James Cleverly he “sold his soul” to serve “a racist PM”.A Corbynite “journalist” says politicians like Sajid Javid and Priti Patel are “no longer a person of colour. They are a turncoat of colour”.Labour has no time for BAME people it cannot deploy as victims of Tory “oppression”. If they reject that victimhood, vote Conservative or, worse, have the talent to reach the top of a Tory Government, they are not “properly” BAME.Such is the poison of “identity politics” spread by Corbyn and his cult of hate-filled halfwits.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not the civil service nor the BBC. Not the House of Lords. Not Tony Blair and John Major and Gordon Brown. Not the Labour Party.And not the combined might of Bob Geldof, Gary Lineker and the bloke who screams, “STOP BREXIT!” in Parliament Square from dawn till dusk.Oh how they all loathed Brexit and everyone who voted for it! They truly believed that those of us who voted to leave the European Union were all thick, racist bigots.There was never any real attempt to change the minds of the .million. There were only sneers, jeers and smears — and the full might of the British establishment committed to stop Brexit from ever happening.Brexit — a true Brexit — has not always seemed inevitable. There have been times over the past few years when the EU looked like the Hotel Calornia, where you can check out but you can never leave.But in the end, it did not matter what they wanted — the elite, the ones with power, the pampered factions of the British establishment, who are totally accustomed to getting their way.Because once the British people had made their democratic decision, Brexit was ALWAYS going to happen in the end.It is more than three years since the nation decided to leave the European Union.But it is only a matter of days that we have had a Prime Minister who actually believes in Brexit.Boris has electried Britain with his vision of a bright, shining future for our country outside of the  rotting EU empire.My heart says Prime Minister Johnson will get Brexit done. So do the bookies.He will probably need a General Election before Christmas to shake up the Parliamentary numbers, but Boris will make it happen.ButBoris can’t do it, then somebody  will make Brexit happen.Brexit is bigger than Boris. Democracy is more important than any one politician.And let the record state: It would have worked the other way around.If the British people had decided in the summer of  that we were staying in the European Union, then no amount of bitching from Brussels-loathing old gits such as myself would have mattered a damn.We would have stayed in the EU for a generation. Our current national debate is not ultimately about leaving or remaining.It is about democracy. And democracy still matters here.Democracy is deep in the British DNA, far deeper than in all those European nations where they have the national memory of a jackboot resting on their throats, far deeper than in all those countries where they have been invaded, occupied and tormented by tyrants.That is why the British establishment, in the end, could not veto Brexit. Sorry, chaps, you can’t dial down democracy. You can’t cancel the will of the people. Not in THIS country.The people decidedIn the end, democracy would not be denied. They could not reverse, overrule or cancel a referendum result in a country that has not been invaded for one thousand years.The will of the establishment — all those ex-Prime Ministers, all those well-heeled big shots, all those Right Honourable members and ermine-clad Lords, all those BBC executives, all those crisp sellers and ex-members of the Boomtown Rats — did not matter more than the will of the people.There is a historical inevitability about this country leaving the EU because, quite simply, it is what the people decided.And no matter what the establishment may believe, the people in this country are not their servants.Our great country is a democracy.Now and for ever, the people are the masters.And that makes Brexit unstoppable.NEW Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson wants a second referendum  but admits she would still campaign to keep the UK in the EU evenwe voted to leave yet again.Oh Jo. You may be a liberal. But you are not much of a democrat.Now the cops have dragged Fadi out, kicking and screaming.The property has been secured but worried neighbours say that Fadi could easily get back in with  a ladder.Oh Fadi, you don’t need a ladder. You need a job.And to stop poncing off the generosity of George Michael.THE Conservative Party is now the true representative of the working class.Lefty loons sneer that the Tories are as riven by racism as Labour, that the anti- Semitism that is rotting Labour is matched by Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.But a political party that disliked Muslims would not appoint the son of a Pakistani bus driver to one of the great offices of state – Sajid Javid as Chancellor of the Exchequer.And a party that was inherently racist would not promote Priti Patel – the daughter of Hindu refugees – to Home Secretary.And what a joy to see Esther McVey – who spent part of her young le in a Barnardo’s care home –to the Cabinet as Housing Minister.We may have an Old Etonian as PM, but the Tories are the party of the people now.I AM starting to look forward to an autumn general election.The most devastating put-down that our new Prime Minister made in the House of Commons was the one aimed at John McDonnell.“The Shadow Chancellor!” said Boris, jabbing a finger at McDonnell’s florid, furious face. “Sacked by Ken Livingstone for being too left-wing . . .  sacked for fabricating a budget!”Like every bully who ever lived, McDonnell can dish it out but he sure can’t take it.Jeremy Corbyn suddenly looks more like a candidate for a care home than  Downing Street. But McDonnell could prove to be an even bigger electoral liability to Labour.If that autumn general election comes, the voters must look at McDonnell and ask themselves: Should I really trust a miserable old Marxist with my wallet Perhaps we should send that aid to countries that are not sending rockets to the Moon.Or better still, help the needy in our own country.THE new series of Strictly will be graced by another of the remarkable Mabuse sisters – Motsi Mabuse, Oti’s big sister, who is replacing Darcey Bussell when the th series starts in September.There have been fears expressed that the new judge might favour her kid sister.I can’t think of anything less likely.The three Mabuse sisters – Oti, Motsi and middle sister Phemelo – all danced their way out of riot-torn, apartheid-riven South Africa.They are all dancing pros to the core of their being.Bet your last sequin that Motsi will not do Oti any favours.HOW sad to hear that  Rutger Hauer has died at the age of . Rutger gave one of cinema’s greatest  performances as the android Roy in  Ridley Scott’s  masterpiece, Blade Runner.

He then took his own le eight years later.Given that one in  of the population identies as gay, this doesn’t exactly seem representative.And that’s probably why @FootballerGay’s account racked up so much support so quickly.The account’s profile said the player was a “proud gay man”. He posted numerous tweets saying his club had been informed of his decision to come out and had been supportive. He tweeted saying that on July  he would reveal his identity.But instead, the account was deleted a couple of days ago. And shortly before that, the bio on the account was changed to read: “I thought I was strong enough. I’m not.”Although his tweets had messages of support from people such as Gary Lineker, lots of other people doubted the authenticity of the account.That includes my husband, an ex professional footballer.His view is that these days no one, from other players to the club, would caresomeone were gay.He should know. He played with Justin Fashanu and says no one in the dressing room had a problem with Justin being gay and he wasn’t treated any dferently to anyone .Still, outside the dressing room, he was singled out.Just one example is the time the owner of the opposing team called him a faggot from the sidelines.Fashanusprinted towards this guy, who got so scared he locked himself in the Press box.Fashanu kicked the door down to find the guy pleading, crying and denying he said anything. Justin could look after himself. But that kind of thing took its toll.Although we’ve moved on since , hearing stories such as that does make you realise why some footballers might think twice about coming out.I don’t carethe Twitter account was real or not. After all, who someone sleeps with is none of my business. Butsomeone wants to come out to the world, it is a terrible state of affairshe thinks he needs to be strong and “brave” to do so.And the reality is that attitudes towards a lot of things have changed over the past couple of decades.I remember when I turned up at the Director’s Box of an away game when I first took over at Birmingham City Football Club in .When I asked where the boardroom was I was told that director’s wives go in the ladies room. When I mentioned that I was the managing director the old boy on the desk put his glasses on, looked at me and said: “Oh yes, you’re that woman . . . stay here and I will find out what to do with you.”Because, at that point, women where banned from entering the boardrooms.That was the first door I ever kicked down. So I know in a very small way how being the first and being dferent to everyone  in football feels.Nowadays I am proud to say there are so many talented women running clubs. And I like to think we have moved on enough that no one would bat an eyelid at a gay footballer.Still, the football world can be a fairly intolerant place for anyone who is anything close to a minority.Maybe it’s the case that until we create a tolerant, accepting environment and culture then footballers won’t feel safe enough to come out.But which will comes first: that . . . or, someone like this being brave enough to admit they are gay and face the possible backlash.Only time will tell.And what I’d really like to see is a football culture in which someone’s sexual orientation really is neither here nor there.DID anyone  wince looking at the photo of the man intercepting his girlfriend’s moment of glory when she was being awarded her degree – to drop down on one knee and propose I guess Edgaras Averbuchas saw it as a romantic gesture but to the onlooker it was just a bit, well, selfish.For a start it looked like he couldn’t bear to let Agne Banuskeviciute have her moment in the sun so muscled in. He attempted to eclipse her huge achievement and make it all about him.Plus, he put her in a very dficult position. I mean, whatAgne wanted to say no Why didn’t he just let her graduate and then ask her in the evening to marry him But also, Agne wasn’t the only person graduating that day – I wonder how everyone  felt about having their big day overshadowed by this big “romantic” gesture Sorry to say that this does not bode well for the relationship.And my advice to this young woman would be to run while you still have the chance and find someone content to allow you to be successful in your own right.[boxout featured-image introI LOVED reading about Mackenzie O’Neill, the -year-old from Canterbury, Kent, who found himself having a bit of a kickabout with Lionel Messi on a Caribbean beach – the stuff that dreams are made of for some kids.]This is the kind of memory that never goes away, but it’s not only children that live for a moment like this. My husband, himself a professional footballer, played on the beach with Diego Maradona about five years agoand he still can’t stop talking about it.[ boxout]KEVIN CASH, once hailed as one of Britain’s most successful property tycoons with a fortune of £million, was declared bankrupt last July with debts of £million.So it is no surprise that he and fourth we Carla are now going to have to make a few changes to their lives.But when you hear that they used to spend £,-a-month on groceries and “housekeeping”, it becomes clear how hard it might be for them to get used to bankruptcy and shopping, presumably, at Lidl.What on earth are they buying  Gold bars to eat Now they’ll be shopping in the bargain bin.As Arsene Wenger used to say about Arsenal’s performances: “One day caviar, and the next cabbage.”WHATEVER you think about Theresa May, no one could deny that she is driven by a sense of duty to the country.So it’s no surprise that she has shed a tear once or twice over the past couple of very dficult months of dashed hopes and disappointments.But what has struck me when she’s been caught crying on camera is how quick people seem to be to triumph over what they see as a sign of weakness.Meanwhile,a man in a position of responsibility is seen to show emotion or shed a tear, he is seen as admirable, noble and passionate.I mean, it’s one thing wearing one in bed, it’s another thing altogether wearing it in bed with a new girlfriend.But to do so on national TV Well, all I can say is, I hope he wasn’t in his socks as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The spending blitz includes one of the country’s “biggest ever” public information campaigns to make sure iniduals and businesses are ready for any outcome.    Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the Government is “operating on the assumption” that Britain will leave the EU without a deal. But Mr Johnson faces staunch opposition to his hardline Brexit plans from within his own party - as senior Tory MPs work cross-party to try to stop him.   Ahead of his trip to Scotland today, Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson issued a defiant challenge to the PM: “I don’t think the Government should pursue a no-deal Brexit and,it comes to it, I won’t support it.” She warned that her party was free to pursue its own Brexit stance “independently of government”, signalling she is ready to defy the new PM less than a week into office. Mr Johnson, deeply unpopular North of the Border, has been warned that he risks breaking up the UKwe crash out without a deal.    Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned he would do “everything” to prevent it including tabling a no confidence motion in the Government. But opponents of the PM’s hardline approach fear that “turbo-charging” no-deal preparations shows he is serious about that course, with all the risks it carries for the economy and the Union.  They believe he is trying to shore up support for no-deal across the country to put pressure on rebel MPs - and prove to the EU he is serious about leaving on October  “no s or buts’. It also dramatically heightens the chances of the new PM suspending Parliament or calling a snap election to force it through.  The previous Government had already allocated more than £bn on getting the country ready for a chaotic departure. New Chancellor Sajid Javid revealed yesterday he had already tasked Treasury officials with finding which areas needed more cash.  “And next week I will be announcing signicant extra funding to do just that,” he added. Government sources indicated this would be at least £bn.   No  revealed that senior ministers - led by Michael Gove - will meet daily from Tuesday in the COBRA room where the Government holds its emergency planning meetings.

In future, we will decide who we give preference to, so we can ensure we are able to attract the most talented and skilled from other parts of the world. The new Home Secretary also vowed to ensure a strong border to help keep out terrorists and criminals, and said all prospective migrants would be checked for criminal records. Ms Patel insisted that a skills-based approach would boost the economy.    We must seize the once-in-a-letime opportunity offered by the end of free movement, she wrote. Free from the shackles of the EU - and an automatic right of entry for their citizens, with or without work - we will be able to give the type of preference to brilliant scientists, academics and highly skilled workers that we want to see more of. But her record, which includes voting for stricter measures for asylum seekers, suggests the crackdown could form part of a wider programme of harsher measures on immigration. Mr Johnson made no secret of his desire for an Australian-style points-based immigration system during the Tory leadership contest. He set out his proposals as part of his wide-ranging first Commons speech as Prime Minister, saying: No-one believes more strongly than me in the benefits of migration to our country.

Insiders say that with a slim majority, Mr Johnson will struggle to get legislation through.And with Brexit looming, Mrs May’s ­influence on the backbenches will be crucial.Mr Johnson killed off her deal this week and said the UK was prepared to leave without one.    And, in a move that infuriated her inner circle, he pressed for the backstop to be scrapped. Sources say she is making plans to set traps for the new leader. Her first step was consolidating her power base. Hours after leaving Downing Street, she watched England’s cricketers with two of her since-sacked ministers, David Gauke and Greg Clark, and ex-chief of staff Gavin Barwell. Earlier, Mrs May was spotted wearing a gold pebble bracelet that bore a striking resemblance to one that belonged to Mrs Thatcher.    This prompted speculation she had been the secret bidder at an auction in May. One Whitehall source said: “May might have bought ­Thatcher’s bracelet but she also plans to copy what she did when she stood down. “She’s going to bring together all her former Cabinet ministers. She’ll plot and give them orders. “They threaten a guerilla war against Boris. She’s angry and will get even.” As she left No Mrs May said she hoped for a Brexit “that works for the whole United Kingdom” – a remark seen as a message to her successor. The replacement of her Cabinet with hardline Brexiteers has given Mrs May a taste for revenge, insiders say.  Within hours of the new PM taking over,  full Cabinet ministers and four others who attended Cabinet were sacked or resigned. The clear-out included many of her old guard. International trade ­secretary Liam Fox and Greg Clark, the business secretary, left their roles, as did ­education secretary Damian Hinds, and James Brokenshire, the housing and communities secretary. Sources say Mr Johnson’s strategy was a gamble – and he is relying on outgoing ministers staying loyal.  One insider said: “They’ve fired people who they think will vote for the Government’s deal on Brexit. That’s why you’ve seen strange people brought in – they had to be bought off. “There are loads of people Mrs May gave positions to. They owe her.” If, as expected, the Tories lose the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election on Thursday to the Liberal ­Democrats, the Government’s working majority will fall from two to one. It will be the smallest of any PM since John Major. The insider added: “Can you imagine getting anything through ” Mrs Thatcher fell out with Mr Major over his handling of the economy just weeks after she resigned as PM. They had a row in January  over interest rates and she was furious about his plan to abandon the poll tax. Brutal reshuffle strategist is real power at No Leave campaign architect Dominic Cummings is believed to have pulled the strings on Boris ­Johnson’s brutal cabinet cull. The reshuffle, dubbed the Night of the Blond Knives, was the bloodiest many in Westminster remember as the new PM dished senior posts out to hardline Brexiteers. From the outside, it looked like a shambles. But those in the know say it was a highly efficient operation and unelected official Mr Cummings is now the real power in Downing Street. Insiders say the reshuffle bore all the hallmarks of one of his favourite tactics – known as the “OODA Loop” and used by fighter pilots.

Nevertheless, Carol took Katie to the GP, who advised rest and pain relief.Her leg looked fine, apart from a slight graze on her shin.But when Katie’s knee continued to hurt, they went back and this time Katie was sent for an x-ray.    ‘The radiologist took a long time and took lots of dferent pictures, so I started to wonder what was wrong,’ remembers Carol.‘When they told us to make an urgent doctor’s appointment for the next day, we began to worry.’ Carol’s husband Grant, , went with Katie to the appointment the following day.The doctor told her to wait outside the room, and delivered devastating news – there was a dark shadow on Katie’s knee, and doctors believed it may be cancer. After that, things moved quickly.Katie saw a surgeon that very afternoon, and was booked in for a biopsy the following week.‘We decided not to tell Katie at this stage, as we didn’t want to worry her, so she was quite oblivious at first – she just wanted to know what was wrong with her knee,’ says Carol.‘But she was in a lot of pain by the time she had the biopsy and was struggling to walk without crutches.’ A week after the biopsy, the family were given the terrible news that Katie had osteosarcoma, a rare type of bone cancer.‘Telling my little girl she had cancer was the worst moment of my le,’ says Carol.‘Her first reaction was, “Just get it out.”‘Later we found out that she messaged one of her friends and said she thought she was going to die.’    Katie started chemotherapy.‘In the oncology ward, we saw patients walking around with no hair, and Katie worried about the same happening to her,’ says Carol. ‘Seeing how ill the other children looked – with feeding tubes and wires trailing from them – opened our eyes to what Katie was about to go through.‘We wondered how we were going to cope.’ Katie became ill very quickly.Her hair fell out in clumps, so she got her hair cut into a bob.Doctors came up with a treatment plan that involved Katie having a large part of her shin removed and replaced with a special metal bar that could be ened as she grew. It was a high-risk operation, but the family tried their hardest to remain positive for Katie.The day of the surgery came around, but just  minutes before Katie was due to go in, doctors halted the operation with grave new concerns. Punishing treatment A biopsy found that the cancer had spread to her thighs, hips and spine.‘They told us she only had a % chance of survival,’ says Carol. ‘It felt completely unreal.‘Doctors upped the chemo dose because we were fighting a losing battle – I told them to do whatever they needed to do to get Katie through this cancer. ‘It was really gruelling.‘Katie’s mouth and throat ulcers were so bad she could barely drink.‘I told herI could take all the pain away and switch places with her I would – she just said, “But you can’t, Mum.”’ Carol and Grant made the tough decision to keep the seriousness of the prognosis from their daughter, because they were worried it would be too much for her to cope with.But unbeknown to them, Katie had found out from a nurse just how ill she was – and heartbreakingly kept it a secret that she knew. The best gt Katie began a punishing new round of chemo that lasted several months. Just before Christmas, she had a full body scan to check on her progress.‘The oncologist came running in to see us and gave us incredible news – the cancer had retreated from her spine and hips!’ says Carol. ‘Although it was still present in her shin and thigh, this meant an operation was now possible. ‘To be told that she had a chance of survival just before Christmas was the best gt imaginable.’ The over-the-moon family had their best ever festive season together, knowing that Katie would be able to have a le-saving operation in the new year.  In February, just before her th birthday, Katie underwent an eight-hour rotationplasty operation to remove the cancer from her leg.Katie was the first patient to have the complex operation at the children’s hospital in Edinburgh.Surgeons amputated her leg from the mid-thigh, removed the cancerous middle-section, before reattaching her calf and foot, rotated at  degrees, so that her heel joint became a new knee.Doctors hoped this would allow Katie to continue her active lestyle much more than a traditional amputation. Amazing recovery ‘Coming round from the surgery, with so many cannulas and wires coming out of her arms was one of the toughest moments of Katie’s le,’ says Carol. ‘She didn’t have any feeling in her leg because there were nerves attached to the cancerous bone, so she had to take medication for the nerve damage and completely retrain her brain.’ But  months on, Katie is thriving.She has regular check ups and x-rays to make sure everything is healthy, but so far she’s been getting better by the day.In August, she’ll be starting secondary school, but still plans to find the time to keep up her sports, as well as volunteering for cancer charities such as Cancer Research UK. After plenty of physio, she can now walk on her prosthetic using a crutch and is even more active than ever. In fact, she’s such a good swimmer that she’s been picked for an elite squad of paraswimmers and has won gold at the Junior and Senior Scottish Disability Sport National Swimming Championships.She’s also recently started to play football and do wheelchair racing, and has been approached by the Scottish Triathlon squad. ‘She has a determination that is beyond her years,’ says Carol.‘We are proud to be her mum and dad – she’s such a resilient young child.‘When she grows up she wants to be a surgeon like the ones who saved her le.‘If not, then a Paralympian!’ ■ "},{"url":null,"title":"british schoolboy really happy after","story":"NewsBritish schoolboy really happy after winning nearly £m at Fortnite World CupJaden Ashman, from Essex, said he is happy to have shown his mother that he was not just wasting time in his bedroomShareCommentsByElaine McCahillDeputy News Editor:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video essex-schoolboy-wins-nearly-m-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British schoolboy is over the moon after winning almost £million at the Fortnite World Cup.

The -year-old, from Paull in Yorkshire, says she was told by the woman ‘don’t worry. We’ll make sure the place is beautul and that your mum is in beautul pictures’. Sam is one of several brides across Hull and East Yorkshire that claim they have been duped out of money they gave to a Hull wedding planner.Araminta Waldron, Kaylie Norris and Kayleigh Enderby are among those who have spoken out, Hull Live reports.   The woman at the centre of the scandal has allegedly gone missing after reports emerged that she abandoned a couple on the eve of their wedding with the pair’s big day saved by radio listeners after an appeal on radio station Stray FM.Multiple people across the country have posted on Facebook about their experience.Sam was due to get married abroad in  but after learning six weeks ago that her mother had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, she brought the wedding forward to . The mum-of-one joined numerous Facebook groups to try and snf out the best deals ahead of the big day. She came across one wedding planner allegedly offering bargains which she initially thought were “too good to be true”.    After getting in touch, messaging her and meeting the woman face to face, Sam was convinced everything was “kosher”. She says she paid more than £ to cover the cost of decorations and £ to cover the deposit for the hire of a marquee. Sam says she last spoke to her on July  before going on Facebook on Friday to find posts and comments from people who said they had been scammed. She claims she attempted to contact the woman again having heard the news but has since heard nothing and she fears she may now have lost hundreds of pounds. “I felt upset, shocked and just absolutely gutted,” Sam said. “I just couldn’t believe somebody could prey on someone’s weakness like that. “Your wedding day is supposed to be the best day of your le and I knew that mine was going to be bittersweet because although I am marrying Phil we had to bring it forward so my mum could be there. “I feel taken advantage of and I did have doubts at first and everybody said it was too good to be true but the messages from her reassured me. She kept saying ‘don’t worry. We’ll make sure the place is beautul and that your mum is in beautul pictures’. “I even said to her that I thought she was myangel and it turns out along she was doing this.”  Sam, who has reported the alleged fraud to the police and is trying to get reimbursed through her bank, said she now faces a race against time to get everything ready for the big day. “It’s going to be hard for us,” she said. “The only reason why I had that money was because I sold some puppies that my dog had had. “I only had the dress to sort out and I was supposed to be trying some on today but I’m not going now because it just doesn’t feel right. “I think she saw us coming and I think she is disgusting and vile. I hope the police find her and justice is served because she could have done this to hundreds of people and I just hope people get their money back. Kayleigh Enderby is getting married to her partner Marc Hodge in just four weeks’ time. She was convinced by a friend to go with the alleged fraudster and was encouraged to hand over £ after seeing positive reviews on her Facebook page. This covered the cost of cars, a buffet and room decorations, and Kayleigh thought everything was in hand until she looked on Facebook on Friday and realised she had been the victim of an alleged scam. “My head just went,” said the -year-old mum from north Hull. “She gave me a package for a certain amount and everything was arranged and paid for but I kept in contact and last spoke to her on July . “Then I went on Facebook yesterday and was like ‘wow – what are we going to do  We get married in four weeksapos.”  Fortunately, Kayleigh has since been reimbursed through her bank and has even tried to help out other desperate brides affected by the alleged scandal. She questioned how someone could be so “horrible” and praised friends and family for rallying round her to ensure her big day still goes ahead as planned. “We’ve got four weeks to try and do it and we will get there – we’ve got a good family backing us up,” Kayleigh said. “She isn’t going to ruin our big day. “At first I said ‘we’re going to have to cancel it’ but then my family and friends said ‘you’re not cancelling it. We will get through it’. “I just don’t know how she can be so horrible. I’m complaining about it being just four weeks away but there are brides getting married today and it’s just lucky everyone is pulling together.” Kaylie Norrie claims she knows the wedding planner as an “old family friend” and after her services were recommended she saw no reason as to why she should doubt her legitimacy. The -year-old from north Hull, who is marrying partner Sean Lane next year, said: “She told us about all these offers and I trusted her. Someone  said she wouldn’t rip us off so we got all the catering off her and made a full bank transfer. “As far as we were aware everything was booked and she sent us a receipt and when we said we needed a photographer she said she had one we could use for the day.” In total, Kaylie claims she gave her £, comprising £ for the catering and £ for the photographer, and she was planning to give her another £ this weekend.

The large fight broke out at a restaurant on the Britannia cruise ship in the early hours of Friday, causing other passengers to hide and flee to their cabins. Plates and furniture were said to be used as weapons during the chaos in which six people were hurt, with some receiving signicant bruising and cuts. Announcements were made on the ship, summoning staff and paramedics to the restaurant at around am. A mother, who was on board with her -year-old son, has hit out claiming that many people on the cruise were just there to aposdrink as much as they couldapos. Did you see what happened  Email webnews@mirror     Speaking to the Daily Mail, she said: From the moment we embarked on the ship we found many of the other guests to be rude, have zero manners or respect for others. The boat was basically Benidorm on Sea with a me, me, me attitude. We found many people were there purely to drink as much as they could with their unlimited drinks packages. Early reports said the violence erupted after a passenger dressed as a clown interrupted a black-tie party held in one of the shipaposs  restaurants. But PO Cruises has since said a clown was not the cause of the mass brawl which broke out on the British cruise ship leading to two arrests.  A female entertainer who works on the Britannia had claimed a clown crashed a black-tie party held in the th-floor restaurant, prompting anger from the other passengers. Richard Gaisford, a reporter for ITVaposs Good Morning Britain, was on board and said staff were told the incident was sparked by the appearance of the clown by a member of a group involved in the brawl. He added: The buffet area was immediately sealed off as medical teams went to help the injured. Staff told me theyaposd never experienced anything like it and those behind the violence were confined to a cabin for the last day of the cruise, waiting for police here in Southampton.  However, PO confirmed on Sunday there was no clown on board and said this was supported by ship staff. This was confirmed by Hampshire Police. After the Britannia arrived in Southampton, a man, , and a -year-old woman, both from Chigwell, Essex, were arrested on suspicion of assault. The pair were released from custody on Sunday but remain under investigation.

That meant they were able to greet anyone at the door, askthey have a Nectar Card or even discuss the weather. This video explains the whole campaign:  We were so impressed by the idea, we decided to join up with the initiative and learn some sign language ourselves. In the video at the top of the page, you can see Daily Mirror columnist Eva Simpson getting a beginneraposs guide to signing from Sainsburyaposs Jonty Parry, finding out how to sign five key phrases that should allow anyone to communicate more easily with someone deaf. The speed with which Eva was able to pick up the phrases shows how easy it is to learn just a few useful bits of sign language - and how valuable that could be when it comes to having a chat with someone who is hard of hearing. About , deaf people in the UK use British Sign Language. British Sign Language isnapost a simple duplication of spoken English. It has its own syntax and grammar, and the order is dferent.  E.g. In English, you would say ‘What is your name ’ In BSL, you would say ‘Your name what ’There isnapost a universal sign language.  There are over  recorded sign languages.For example, American Sign Language is not the same as British Sign Language.  ASL alphabet is one handed, and BSL is two handed. In fact, there are so many dferent versions of sign language across the globe, you can here see how Happy Christmas is signed in  dferent countries!   Paul Robertson, the store manager at Bath, explained that was the exact idea behind aposSignsburyapossapos. “I thought it was the perfect time to use the opportunity to explore new ways to make our store more deaf-friendly, he said. We have many hard of hearing customers in Bath and always want to make their experience as brilliant as possible, and we hope Signsbury’s will help better their time in store even more.  The in-store drive to make the hearing-impaired feel more included is just one example of many initiatives being rolled out as part of the  Days of Community scheme. All , Sainsburyaposs colleagues are being given the chance to volunteer for a cause they feel passionately about in their local community. From community fundraising to hosting events and launching their own local campaigns, they are supporting causes ranging from community gardens to sports teams and elderly care homes. When in conversation with anyone deaf or hard of hearing, there are some very simple things you can do to make things a little easier…Relax Don’t panic! SmileMake eye contactCommunicate clearly – do not cover your mouth!

This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes the limit for dancer jessica","story":"Janet WestUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith Highland Games season in full fling, one talented Ardrishaig dancer scooped three first places in three dferent events last week.Eight year old Jessica McCrae, a pupil at Ardrishaig Primary, was crowned winner in the beginners section at Rosneath, Inveraray and Taynuilt Highland Games.

and cousin being installed as Standard Bearer, dreaming that one day it would be him.For the boy named after the townrsquos Patron Saint, Ronan was destined to be the pride of Innerleithen.Only it was not with a crook in hand as the young Saint, it was to be many years later as a young man clutching St Ronanrsquos Blue Banner.The childhood dream became a reality on Friday, when he graced the stage and raised high the Blue Banner over fellow townsfolk as the Standard Bearer for .His moment in the spotlight came after outgoing Standard Bearer Jamie Boyd, ed it unsullied and untarnished to Games President Alan Patterson.Jamie managed to keep control of his emotions, but it was clear that the honour meant a great deal to him as he fought back the tears.\"I trust that I have carried out my duties of office to the satisfaction of my fellow townspeople. My year in office has been a very eventful and enjoyable one. Rosie and I have been guests at many Border Festivals and enjoyed each one immensely.ldquoIrsquod like to thank my supporters and their lasses for all their advice, my family for all their help, and Rosie for accompany me and helping me make this year so successful.Mr Patterson thanked the outgoing Standard Bearer and said he had \"worthily upheld his stewardship\".Cheers erupted in the hall as Ronan was called up to the stage to be installed as Standard Bearer for .Mr Patterson said: ldquoYou have been called to this high office and your past record shows by word and deed that you justly deserve this honour. Guard this Standard securely and bear yourself well that you may long retain the trust of your fellow townspeople.\"Standard Bearerrsquos Lass Caitlin Urquhart, was then called upon to invest Ronan with his sash and buss his colours.After cheers that raised the roof off the historical hall, Caitlin was presented with her Cleikum Brooch.Addressing the audience, the newly installed Standard Bearer said: \"It is a great honour for me to be chosen as Standard Bearer of my native town, which at this time celebrates the traditions associated with its history. To our Dux Boy, Aaron, who tonight keeps alive the memory of our Patron Saint, St. Ronan, I tender my congratulations and best wishes for a successful year in office.\"As Standard Bearer for , it will be my earnest endeavour to honour the memory of the founders of St. Ronanrsquos Border Games by carrying the Blue Banner of St. Ronanrsquos for the ensuing year. My thanks to you, Mr President, to my Right and Left Hand Supporters and to you, ladies and gentlemen for the reception you have accorded me tonight.\"Proudly holding the banner at the memorial for the fallen, the rain battered down upon the new Standard Bearer who never flinched.He said: ldquoIt was the one and only time I would get to experience that moment as the Standard Bearer so I wasnrsquot going to let the rain bother me. I just tried to take in that moment.Ronan told us that being installed as the Standard Bearer is a ldquodream come true.ldquoIt has been an amazing week. I have loved every single minute of it but it went by so quick and I canrsquot believe itrsquos over already. I enjoyed every part of it but dancing the reel at the Games Ball was extra special. Walking in with the pipe band playing gave me goose bumps.ldquoThe Cleikum Ceremony was another highlight. I was a bit nervous for the installation speech but once I got that out of the way I was just so happy and couldnrsquot stop smiling.ldquoEveryone done an amazing job, the week went smoothly and all the children done fantastic in their roles.Ronan has carried on what has become a family tradition, with his name being added to the long list of Standard Bearers at St Ronanrsquos Wells.He told us:

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"one-month-left-claim-ppi-mis-selling","story":"There is just one month left to complain to firms about PPI mis-selling as the deadline looms nearer.Consumers have until August   to get their complaint in to financial firms or lose their chance of getting their money back.PPI was often added to products such as store cards, credit cards or mortgages.But the insurance, which was intended to protect peoplethey could not keep up with their payments, due to illness or unemployment for example, was widely-mis-sold.People were pressured into buying it, did not know they had it, or it was unsuitable.Weve launched the final stage of our PPI Complaints Deadline campaign.

The new lights would replace wall-mounted lights and could, residents fear, make a signicant impact on the character of the area.A number of residents have been in contact about this matter as they fear that the introduction of these lights, which are really more suited to an urban setting, are inappropriate to their village.I think it is incumbent on the council to show some regard to their concerns as local people are, rightly, proud of their architectural heritage and do not want to see it compromised by the insensitive implementation of a policy which is not appropriate for their community.I would urge them to look again at this issue.Donald Cameron MSP,"},{"url":null,"title":"letter thank you tarbert","story":"On the Friday, while out walking through the village, my walking assistance buggy went into a pothole causing me to lose balance and fall over.

The lizards can regrow their tails and perform the same display againneeded.Common lizards are protected under the Wildle and Countryside Act  from intentional killing, injury or sale.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

and paint one of the Oor Wullie sculptures, I spent a week in April bringing my design to le.ldquoI had some aching muscles and very sore knees after crawling around the larger-than-le sculpture to

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

UNICEF Rights Respecting School gold award, which means that it had proved that it incorporates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into the school through both teaching and actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell and Neil Gilbert, to ask questions and discuss the best ways to engage young people with what is going on in the community and to ensure their input is noted.The children asked about the plans for the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station and whether more activities for young people such as Rainbows and Scouts could be introduced to the areaWhen addressing the councillors and community councillors, Daniel, a house captain from St Gabrielrsquos, said: ldquoItrsquos important for us at this stage to know what our future is going to hold, and to try and make a dference when and where we can.ldquoTo be involved in the community council in some way would be fantastic, as it would give us comfort to know that the community is being taken care of, as well as what decisions were being made that might affect us.It was decided that the community council would send the agenda for each meeting to the school a few days before the meeting took place so that the children could see it and comment on any issues being raised.The community council said in a statement: ldquoWe would like to thank the four fantastic pupils from St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who attended the community council.ldquoIt was so refreshing to have such polite and knowledgeable young people along to one of our meetings to share their opinions and views on our agenda topics and ask the questions they feel most relevant to their lives.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming them along to future meetings and collaborating with them on the issues that affect all of us living in

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

A spokesman said it is not just sunburn, dehydration and hayfever which people need to be mindful of, but also respiratory problems, particularly the elderly.Dr Emilia Crighton, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clydersquos deputy director of public health, said: ldquoA number of Scottish people are fair-skinned and need to take adequate steps to ensure their skin is protected. As the weather forecast is for sunshine over the next few days everyone should take a few simple precautions.ldquoChildren are especially vulnerable and care should be taken to ensure they are covered up adequately.

Unfortunately - for all concerned - fears have been realised.A trans woman, Jessica Yaniv, approached a number of female beauticians to ask for a Brazilian bikini wax, all - perhaps by coincidence - were lone home workers, the majority of whom were immigrant women.Unfortunately, Ms Yaniv was unable to find any beautician willing to carry out the intimate wax because she still retains male genitalia and each of these women only worked on female genitalia.:Are you trans  Next Scottish census to ask questions on gender IDMs Yaniv, a trans rights campaigner, then raised action against  of the women at British Columbiarsquos human rights tribunal, alleging discrimination and seeking damages of several thousanddollars from each.It was too much for several of the women to fight and so they folded their businesses instead, losing their livelihoods.The case cleaves opinion in two: either it is discriminatory of the beauticians to refuse to wax a trans womans genitals regardless of what they look like, or it is discriminatory to force a woman to handle male genitals against her will.The tribunal will make a decision - and that decision may well be to disregard womens boundaries and dignity by finding for Ms Yaniv and asserting that the law believes it is discrimination for women to refuse to touch a penis when that penis belongs to a trans woman.Ms Yaniv has posted deeply troubling comments on social media about young girls, although she claimed at the tribunal her account was hacked. There are those who would say she is vexatious and should be disregarded. Fiona Robertson, the SNPs National Womens and Equalities Convener, says Ms Yaniv is a female predator and that women predators often use their womanliness to gain access to victims.Critics of Ms Robertsons stance would strongly dispute male predatory behaviour being attributed to women.I would not dream of speaking for trans people but Im going to take a stab that the vast majority just want to get on with their lives peaceably and,asked about the Yaniv case, would be of the \"not in my name\" persuasion. Trans people cannot want this sort of legal action either, yet activists and allies have remained silent on the case.However, it cant be ignored and certainly not by a Scotland where there is a bitter ide between trans allies and, for want of a better shorthand, womens allies.Trans woman are women has become a political slogan in support of self ID and of respecting the rights of trans people but to take it to its conclusion is to fundamentally redefine the word \"woman\" and remove the element of sex from the words definition.The argument from some feminists is that the introduction of self ID is the beginning of a creep towards removing womens sex-based rights.Currently \"sex\" is a protected characteristic and so, for example, womens refuges have the right to refuse to house male-bodied people or, indeed, employ male-bodied people.Jo Swinson, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, has been highly vocal in declaring that trans women are women but less clear in defining exactly what she means. If it is the Liberal Democrats stance that trans women are literally women then it suggests the Liberal Democrats would support the removal of the sex-based exemption.To avoid Yaniv-style legal cases, the Scottish Government must be explicit in how the Equality Act will apply to any new law.But explicit answers to troubling questions are exactly what this public conversation is lacking and no wonder when you have an MP, Mhairi Black, calling women who disagree with self ID \"Jeremy Hunts\", a rhyming slang it takes no genius to work out.The Scottish Government already confuses \"sex\" with \"gender\" in its consultation on self ID. Pro-self ID campaigners have pointed to the reassurance that there will be the protection of up to two years prison term for those who abuse self ID. Butyou cannot define \"woman\", how can you legislate effectively to determine who is or isnt really living as a woman : years of Stonewall: The fight for LGBT rightsIn Canada too, a woman has reported to the human rights tribunal that a womans shelter for recovering addicts made her homeless because she refused to share a twin room with a trans woman. The woman was a rape victim and felt frightened at being in close quarters with a male-bodied person who was \"masc presenting\", that is, maintained a beard and wore typically masculine clothes.There was no suitable alternative space in the refuge and so the woman was asked to leave. This is another scenario women have raised questions about but been given no clear answers.Scottish Womens Aid and Rape Crisis have both made statements saying they are in support of self ID. Rape Crisis also supports men so its no surprise the charity supports trans people - it would be an odd developmentthey did not.Scottish Womens Aid, the umbrella organisation for womens aid groups in Scotland, focuses on policy and research, it does not run refuges and so, while it supports self ID and takes a clear line that domestic abuse affects trans women too, its position is largely academic in that it will not have to deal with the frontline practicalities of balancing rights.Inidual womens aid charities in Scotland have gone on public record to say they have real concerns about self-ID.Wouldnt it be useful, instead of sloganeering and calling women c****, for politicians and charities to give explicit, detailed answers to questions being asked  The only way to allay fears is to tackle them head-on.Women are told their boundaries are not under threat - the Yaniv case contradicts this. They are told there is no conflict when it comes to women-only spaces such as refuges, they are told men will not pose as trans women to gain access to womens spaces - there are multiple cases in Canada of this happening.It will only help the debate to progressquestions raised in Canada are answered in Scotland - for the benefit of everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"english-mp-appointed-scotland-office-minister","story":"The Prime Minister passed over  Scottish Conservative MPs to give the role to Robin Walker, the MP for Worcester, who will also double as a Northern Ireland minister.A huge honour to be made Minister for the union working with @BorisJohnson @ScotSecofState  @NIOgov - our precious union deserves to thrive through brexit  beyond.

Itrsquos a euro bonanza.Anyone who has seen the Tour live will have lasting memories, although the riders will have come and gone in seconds, starting in the hours before when the y sponsorsrsquo caravan comes through throwing out gts like T-shirts and sweets to the discarded ridersrsquo water bottles retrieved from the leading groups and the peloton, to the reminiscences afterwards, the photographs and the conversations in the town square bistros.But eventhe competitors at the heart of the event have bypassed quickly the large screens inside and outside will have been following on TV. From the cameras on the backs of motorbikes as they weave up and down the field to those in the helicopters overhead which donrsquot just capture the agony of the event below but the grandeur of the peaks and chateaux, to the eye-catching little tableaux put on by every village and town the route cuts through, from straw bales spelling out a message to massive art structures, down to sprayed support for a favourite rider on the roads.Ron McKay: Socks and dregs and rock n roll, beach le, the royal prerogative and the cautionary tale of a fat man slimmedSo why canrsquot we do it here  Why canrsquot we mount a race which will put Scotland at the forefront of the worldrsquos attention and which would pull in millions in sponsorship cash and tourist euros, dollars and yen and do more for the country in a year than VisitScotland. After all, Yorkshire piggy-backed on a Le Tour start and launched its own bike race ndash it is a real point of conversation for cycle fans and ordinary punters.And just think ndash even on a good day in Bronte Country, Yorkshire hasnrsquot a patch on bonny Scotland.As well as the sponsorship, the TV rights and spin-offs, French towns and cities compete for Le Tour to start and finish in their town or city, from around pound, to pound,, although this year Brussels is thought to have paid around pound million for the Grand Depart there.As with so many great ideas, the women have got there first, and this yearrsquos three-stage Womenrsquos Tour of Scotland sets off from Dundee on August .So surely, with so much wonderful scenery to celebrate and so much international exposure to be enjoyed, a full professional Tour along the lines of the French extravaganza is long overdue To encourage the Scottish Government to take this idea and run, or rather pedal, with it, wersquove devised our own -stage tour, showing off the best of the country.Wersquove also borne in mind that wersquove had to miss some worthy parts out because the infrastructure canrsquot now support the tour caravan, the dozens of cars and vans, the number of beds needed for riders and support, as well as the thousands of people who will drive there and line routes, supporting the riders.There would be intermediate sprints for prizes, also for hill and mountain wins, as well as prizes for the most combative rider of the day.As well as a yellow jersey for the winner there would also be inidual awards for the king of the mountains, a green jersey for the best sprinter, judged on points, and also an award for the young rider ndash under  ndash of the tour, judged on placing.Obviously, the roads involved would be closed for the duration of the lead-up to the stage and its aftermath. So here it goes, the Tour DrsquoEcosse is off ...Day OneThe Tour leaves from Glasgow and heads south to Girvan, across to New Cumnock, through Kilmarnock and back to Glasgow  kilometresDay TwoDepart from Glasgow, down through Clydebank and up along the side of Loch Lomond before the long climb to Crianlarich and the push to Glen Coe, Ballachulish and Fort William. Just over  kilometres.Day ThreeIn the shadow of Ben Nevis the tour heads to Spean Bridge and Invergarry, before a left-hander towards Morvich and Dornie before ending at Kyle of Lochalsh. A shorter stage, some km, but a punishing and rewarding one.Day FourItrsquos a tour of Skye. From Kyle across the bridge and through Broadford, Portree, up through Skeabost and round past Dunvegan, down through Sligachan and back to Kyle. kmDay FiveKyle to Inverness through Achnasheen and Dingwall. A stage of unexpected ndash and for many completely unknown ndash beauty. kmDay SixFrom Inverness down the Apast Aviemore and over the Pass of Drumochter, on to Dalwhinnie and Pitlochry, then across to Bridge of Cally and Blairgowrie, and on to Dundee. km.Day SevenTime trial from Dundee to Perth. km of predominantly flat going ndash one for the speed merchants.Day EightFrom Perth to Crieff, then Gleneagles, west to the Trossachs and finishing at Stirling. A stage of real iety and beauty. kmDay NineLeaving Stirling the riders head to Hamilton, the Biggar and up through Penicuik the Pentlands, to Musselburgh then Edinburgh, by way of Leith. kmDay TenThe last day. The survivors do a circuit of Edinburgh of km culminating in a sprint at the top of the Royal Mile or, for the yellow jersey, a perambulation round the sights of the capital.How does Le Tour work :: The winner is the rider who completes the course in the shortest time. So much so obvious. But hewonrsquot do it without the assistance of the seven other riders in the team and the technical back-up.:: Each team has a nominated leaderwith the other riders as domestiques, specialist sprinters or climbers , the workers who are at the service of the leader, chasing down breakaways or delaying the pack , leading pursuits, sheltering the boss from the winds, dropping back to help him hersquos in trouble, getting him drinks and feeding gels from the team cars.:: Each stage has intermediate sprints ndash and or climbs ndash which are sponsored with prizes and points for a half dozen or so riders. Itrsquos the same for the first few riders at the stage end, with the addition of a time bonus for the winner, usually six seconds over the rest.:: At the end of the tour the rider with the most sprint points wins the green jersey, the top climber wins the polka dot jersey, the overall winner the yellow ndash although in Tour DrsquoEcosse wersquoll go for a saltire on navy blue.:: It isnrsquot just an inidual race ndash teams are rated according to their combined times, with prizes. The teams are sponsored, in most cases by more than one company.:: The prize pot in Le Tour is relatively modest ndash when compared with Wimbledon or The Open ndash with a total of around pound million to be won, which the  teams and the  riders are competing for.:: The overall winner in the GC, the general classication, takes away pound, but, traditionally, splits the money with the seven other team members."},{"url":null,"title":"government-operating-assumption-no-deal-brexit-says-michael-gove","story":"The new Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is in charge of no-deal preparations in the Cabinet Office, said there was a ldquovery real prospect that an agreement would not be struck with Brussels before the Halloween deadline.Writing in The Sunday Times, he said that while the aim was still to leave with a deal, the Government needed to prepare for every eventuality.ldquoWith a new prime minister, a new government, and a new clarity of mission, we will exit the EU on October .

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

And Johnson is the best recruiting sergeant the SNP could have asked for, which is why Nicola Sturgeon was quick to say she would consider accelerating plans for the second independence referendum she has already pledged to hold before .There are huge logistical obstacles to overcome we know the new Prime Minister is even less likely than Theresa May to grant a Section  order for a legally binding plebiscite. But with a UK government now aping Trumpian politics and refusing even to feign interest in its northern neighbour, there could be no better opportunity to win over No voters.Unfortunately, this opportunity has presented itself at the worst possible time for both the SNP and the wider Yes movement, which are in the process of tearing themselves asunder. Divisions between the left and right wings, the gradualists and the revolutionaries, the newbies and the old-timers, which were kept in check by the party machine and the need to unite behind their common cause in , have exploded into the open. The internal feuding is now so visible, and the atmosphere so poisonous, the campaign is faltering, just as it ought be gaining momentum. One of the most volatilefaultlines has been the reform of the Gender Recognition Actwhich –passed – would allow trans people to self-identy and remove the requirement for medical evidence. Less than a year ago, this was regarded as an easy win – a human rights issue that would consolidate the party’s reputation as a progressive force. But this gambit backfired. Every day now, political Twitter resounds to the angry exchanges between party members who have positioned themselves on either side of this fractious debate. Disagreements over policy are not unusual what sets this apart is the rancour of the rhetoric, and the bad faith, with some members of both camps resorting to abuse and others regarding it as a make-or-break issue for their continued membership of the party. So problematic has it proved that the reforms have been put on hold. However, instead of providing a cooling-off period, the delay appears to have created space for acrimony to fester and grow.Further isions are being caused by a perceived inertia at the top of the party. Johnson’s election has increased the pressure for action. With no obvious mechanism to achieve a second referendum, some on the fringes are demanding a Unilateral Declaration of Independence .Given there is no evidence of a majority in favour of separation, this would be reckless in the extreme. It would leave us isolated and raise the spectre of civil disorder. And yet those who resist the idea – many of whom were campaigning for independence before their critics were born – are having their commitment questioned.Throw into this melee, the implosion of All Under One Banner– the flag-fixated organisation beloved of the Trumpian tendency, but scorned by much of the mainstream, and you have a highly combustible set of circumstances. That AOUB would self-destruct – the director of operations Manny Singh was sacked earlier this month after being reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with breaching the Civic GovernmentAct – was entirely predictable, but cries of “I told you so” are hardly likely to placate those who may now be deprived of an outlet for their frustrations.Some of the party’s current problems are of its own making. It failed to recognise that the reform of the GRA, which could be seen as pitting the rights of two oppressed groups against each other, would be trickier to steer through Holyrood than the Marriage and Civil Partnership Act. It also ignored warnings about the need for senior party figures to clamp down on the extremists who frequently threaten its credibility. It is too late now to tame those wilder elements who shout about UDI.Though, for some, the isions are the product of sincerely held beliefs, for others they are proxies for a power struggle between those who continue to support Sturgeon and those who support Alex Salmond. Ever since a series of sex allegations were made against the former First Minister, and particularly since he was charged, the party appears to have been in the grip of a major power struggle between the two camps.Whatever the outcome, and however unfair this seems, the court case has the potential to bring down the First Minister and it has been clear for some time that Joanna Cherry fancies herself as the successor.Meanwhile, the UK political chat is of a possible general election in the autumn. With no likelihood of Johnson experiencing a change of heart on Scotland’s right to self-determination, this could provide the best route to the SNP securing a Section  order. A large rise in support for the SNP would be interpreted as a mandate for a second referendum and might allow the party to hold a position of power in a Labour minority government just as the DUP has done in the minority Tory government since June .In order to capitalise on this opportunity, however, the SNP would have to mobilise speedily and effectively. It would need to remember that only by parking its dferences and uniting behind a common goal did the movement drive the Yes vote up from  to  per cent in the last campaign.This time round, the dferences are more entrenched. The efforts to undermine Sturgeon have been concerted. With the court case pending, there is little she can do but hold her nerve against the plotters and conspiracy theorists to refuse to pander to those who fail to understand that independence – to be legitimate – must be the settled will of the Scottish people.If the party cannot see past its internal struggles and marshal itself into some sort of fighting force, it will squander the chance to rescue Scotland from the grips of the Tory cabal and the potential catastrophe of a No Deal Brexit. That battle can only be won by convincing the majority of Scots that independence will produce a better, more consensual kind of politics not merely a tartan version of the back-stabbing, ego-driven lust for power which has inflicted so much damage on the UK over the last five years.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wanted nurse for remote scottish island with population of 170","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Isle of Raasay, which has a population of around  people, has not had resident medical cover for a decade, despite a long campaign by islanders to get a community nurse.The island, considered to be one of the most beautul parts of Scotland, is reliant on medics travelling from neighbouring Skye, with one GP surgery held once a week on a Wednesday, and three district nurses working on a rota Monday to Friday.: Historic Burns Monument reopens following major restoration work: Wanted: Teacher for remote Scottish islandFor the past four years, residents have been campaigning to get a nurse who lives on the island, as there is no out-of-hours medical provision.In December , NHS Highlands unsuccessfully tried to recruit a resident nurse.But hopes are high that a new recruitment drive could bring someone looking for a slower pace of le to the island, with a job ad closing next month.Anne Gillies, chair of Raasay Community Council, said: \"A resident nurse on Raasay will be a huge boost to the community.\"It will make an enormous dference, particularly to families with young children and our elderly population.\"Were all very happy at the prospect of having a nursing presence on the island again.\"Kate Earnshaw, district manager for NHS Skye, Lochalsh and Wester Ross, said: \"This is an exciting opportunity for a suitably qualied and experienced nurse to join the CommunityNursing Team and make a real dference to healthcare provision on Raasay.\"We hope this opening will appeal to candidates looking for a real sht in lestyle.\"Raasay is a wonderful place to live and work and we look forward to attracting lots of applications.\"The Band  post is permanent, can be full-time or part-time, and comes with a salary of £, to £,.He or she would be the first clinician on the scene in the event of an emergency on the island, would be required to provide on-call nursing cover, and would be the main point of contact on the island for the Skye-based GPs and rural medics at the MacKinnon Memorial Hospital in Broadford, on Skye.The role promises \"considerable autonomy\" as Raasays nurse will be responsible for assessing, planning, implementing and reviewing the islands healthcare needs.NHS Highland said it is seeking \"qualied, confident, competent and experienced\" candidates who must be \"adaptable and resourceful, working without a hospital or GP at hand\".Up to date clinical knowledge and skills are required, as is a desire to work in a remote, rural setting.The health board hopes to be able to hire more than one nurse for the island.A spokesman said: \"The post holder would have a lot of iety in their job every day is likely to be dferent as they would be dealing with patients from young children to the elderly.\"In addition to the professional challenges of working predominantly on their own, the remote location could present some challenges to everyday le, such as transport.\"For the community, the presence of resident nurse cover is greatly anticipated and will bring reassurance.\"Raasay is a wonderful place to work and live and to bring up a family.

The Prime Minister picks the cabinet,” he said. “Of course she would have preferred that I stayed in the cabinet, because we have a longstanding and very close relationship… [but] he wanted his own person.”Mundell stressed the dferences between the political cultures in Scotland and the rest of the UK – symbolised by the radically dferent editorial lines taken by the UK and Scottish editions of the Sun – as he urged Johnson to follow the Scottish Tory leader’s advice.“There is no doubt that Ruth has transformed Conservative fortunes in Scotland and has a lot of data and facts and experience about how that’s been achieved, and she does want to work with Boris to demonstrate what messages are important in Scotland, what people want from their political leaders, what they want in Scotland, what they want in the UK.“Scotland is a distinctive political environment… the newspaper environment, the political environment, the political priorities, they’re completely dferent. That has to be recognised.”Mundell pledged to hold Johnson to account as a backbencher over his promises to boost UK investment in Scotland and create a “Union unit” to scrutinise government policy – something he told the Prime Minister at the meeting where he was sacked from his job.“I’ve never asked a PMQ, so I’m quite keen to break my duck… I will have a PMQ submitted every week. I won’t be standing up asking Boris to agree he’s great. It won’t be one of those.”Mundell cited the  Scotland Act, which devolved income tax and welfare powers to Scotland – “perhaps people feel negatively about it when they’re paying more income tax” – as well as the £.bn worth of city-region deals as the highlights of his four years as Scottish Secretary.“One thing that I hope my successor [Alister Jack] will be able to do is complete that and make sure every part of Scotland has benefitted from a growth deal,” said Mundell. “When I visited the new concert hall in Edinburgh, the site of it, I pushed for that to be included in [the Edinburgh and Southeast Scotland] deal.“I persuaded the chancellor to back it even though it was devolved spending, so you can make a dference across the whole of Scotland, and that’s what I like to think I’ve done.”He said he was also proud of boosting the UK government’s promotional work in Scotland from the “pittance” being spent previously, arguing: “The UK government needs to make the case every day for what it does in Scotland, the way the Scottish Government makes the case every day for independence.” A new “hub” at Queen Elizabeth House in Edinburgh would be a “focal point” boosting awareness of the UK government’s work in Scotland, he added.Asked what his greatest regret in office was, Mundell joked: “As the st century philosopher Adele says, regrets and mistakes are memories made.“I was very disappointed that we didn’t get Jock the cat into Dover House. It was blocked by health and safety. Once we’re out of the EU we’ll be able to have cats run amok.”But he admitted that the government mishandled vital Brexit legislation that covered powers in devolved areas ing from Brussels, which led to claims of a “power grab” and a showdown between the Holyrood and Westminster governments in the Supreme Court.“I take responsibility for the fact that I don’t think we handled the EU Withdrawal Bill as well as we might have done.“We got there in the end but we had to go quite a circuitous route to do that. We didn’t manage expectations. I didn’t manage expectations.”Looking back on nine years at the Scotland Office, first as a minister of state before joining the cabinet, Mundell said: “From my recent visit to Boyd Tunnock’s factory, which is real-le Willy Wonka land, to attending the March of Light in Budapest to commemorate Jane Haining’s death in the Holocaust, to seeing our new building grow in Edinburgh, getting to parts of Scotland I hadn’t otherwise been to, and our visits overseas where I really got to understand how strong Scotland’s brand is… I’m enormously grateful to have had the opportunity to serve, and I’m very grateful to the civil servants who supported me in the Scotland Office.“I’m the longest serving Scottish Secretary for  years, since Ian Lang… I think the office has gotten stronger.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

While many people can fondly remember hearing its call in years gone by, Rathlin is the only place in Northern Ireland where the birds have been heard in recent years.A male has been heard calling in one location on Rathlin each year since  and now RSPB NI staff have recorded two breeding males in two separate sites on the island this summer.Known for their unmistakeable ‘crex-crex’ call, corncrakes are highly secretive and like to settle in early growing tall vegetation like nettles, cow parsley and irises. One of the sites - in Church Bay - is on land owned by an islander but managed by RSPB NI that has had nettles planted by staff and teams of volunteers to encourage the birds – summer migrants from western Africa – toto Rathlin.RSPB Rathlin Island Warden Liam McFaul said: “It’s fantastic and really encouraging that the work we’re doing for corncrakes is making a dference. It’s been an exceptional year because for the first time since the s we have two calling corncrakes and this is brilliant. The birds have two broods and the second brood will be hatching in late July.”Corncrakes are rarely spotted but the Church Bay male bird has been calling during the daytime now since mid-May and has come out into the open on occasion and has even been captured on camera.Liam has a theory about why the bird is so vocal and has been spotted moving around.Liam said: “He has been calling out in two or three dferent locations and then he’s moving across the road to the other side and is calling quite a lot, all night long and quite often during the day.“Because of this behaviour, this could indicate that there could be more than one female in that area and he’s tending to two areas at once. But because the females are silent, we don’t really know.”The second male corncrake has been recorded on private land owned by wildle-friendly farmer Richard Green and his family on the western end of Rathlin.Liam McFaul believes theof a sustainable corncrake population would be a huge boost for the island.One person treated by emergency services after dramatic Lough Neagh rescue - jet ski not seen for more than two hours Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"“Hopefully we will see their numbers increase and get a sustainable population, with four or five pairs regularly breeding, and this feels more achievable after this landmark year. Each breeding pair can produce up to  eggs each breeding season, although there is a high mortality rate with these birds. Increasing corncrake numbers could be a big tourism benefit for Rathlin. People travel to Tory Island in Donegal just because of the corncrakes there,“ he said.Liam said that RSPB volunteers have played their part in this conservation success story on Rathlin. “We’ve been creating areas of early cover over the last  years or so. This has involved teams of volunteers on the mainland over the winter digging up nettle rhizomes because that’s ideal habitat for corncrakes. If you plant them they grow early in the season and that encourages the birds to come in.“I’m sure some volunteers will spend a day digging nettles on a wintry day and think ‘What’s this all about ’ But when you stand here now on a summer’s day and think there’s a bird that’s globally threatened and you have helped to save it by just going out and digging up some nettle rhizomes, well you know most of the people involved will be absolutely delighted at the results.”Farmer Richard Green is delighted to have been hearing the corncrake’s call - on the second corncrake site - over the last few years.He said: “For me, it started four years ago when we had a corncrake calling right through the summer.“To hear that this year there are two pairs, one of which is on our land, is great. It shows us we must be doing something right for them. The way we farm, we’re sensitive to nature and the birds and we try to do whatever we can to help.”After the second brood hatches later this month, the birds will migrate back to Africa in August or September.Corncrakes are easily spooked, so members of the public are asked not to try and get close to the birdsthey hear their call as they are on private land and it is also important that the birds are not disturbed and that this sensitive conservation effort is not compromised.try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1985871.jpg--.jpg?1563356127000\n","title":"council to honour ww2 veterans with silver poppy gift","story":"WHILE urging Mid  East Antrim Council to honour the last surviving veterans of World War , DUP councillor John Carson reflected on the cost of that global conflict to one local family.Proposing a motion that each surviving veteran in the area - from across the services and the merchant navy - should receive a silver Poppy of Remembrance in November, Alderman Carson said it was also fitting to remember those who had made the supreme sacrice especially with the th anniversary of the outbreak of war looming.

Following its refurbishment, the church has become a hive of community activity and will welcome former Clannad musician Moya Brennan for a highly anticipated concert on August .The County Donegal performer has just released a new album, Timeless, and will play a number of shows throughout the country in the coming months, but luckily she was able to be booked for the Greater New Lodge Community Festival through a mutual interest with Abundant Grace Pastor Sharon Perry.“I serve on the board of a Christian charity with Moya Brennan and I happened to ask hershe would be available,” Sharon explained.“She wasn’t free the night we were supposed to be having it, so we change the date and she was very willing to come along.“It’s a great opportunity for the local community to see such a well-known performer. I think it’s something that doesn’t come along often so close to home. You might see an advert for one of the concert halls in Belfast for Moya, but to have it on our own doorstep here is brilliant. Moya is a lovely lady with a beautul ministry of music.”As well as providing a fantastic night of entertainment, all proceeds from the concert will go to to Special Olympics Ireland.“We ourselves as a charity try to make ends meet to get the work done that is in our hearts to do,” Sharon stated.“We try to help other charities where we can, so we thought this was an opportunity to help kids with learning disabilities. There are lots of activities there for them to be stimulated through sport.”Looking forward to the gig, Sharon said: “We have Zephaniah Dancers coming as well, who are an Irish dance group based in Portadown. They’ll be the support act. The strange thing is that they’re really excited about coming as well because they have actually choreographed a dance to one of Moya’s songs and had got permission to perform it in dferent places. The fact that the girls are now coming together with Moya is amazing.“There will be a mixture of secular music, Gaelic songs and a few Christian songs in the mix as well.”She continued: “I hope people take the opportunity because the chance doesn’t come along often to see Moya Brennan for £. We know that people will come from where, and we welcome that as well, but we would really love the local community to come along and at £ most people can manage that.

At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead. In short, we need a statesman, not a showman.“Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefiting. With an impending no-deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.“To date he has failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario # needs that require more than merely a can-do attitude to resolve.“The Irish border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreementmishandled. It is also impacting on the ability of parties to restore the political institutions here. He now needs to demonstrate his ability to act with sensitivity and impartiality in his engagements with local parties.“It#s time to cut the bluff, bluster and bombastic rhetoric and start to provide the kind of reassurance business and civic society needs. Whilst I remain sceptical he will do that, I wish him well and will be more than happy to be proved wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi. Another rousing ending to another Arranmore evening was brought courtesy of the impressive Honeyfeet.You can check out the final weekend of entertainment at the Earagail Arts Festival at eaf.ieWe stayed on Arranmore island at Early’s Bed # Breakfast where you will get a great welcome from Jerry and his we Pat.We travelled to Arranmore Island on the Blue Ferry – https:arranmorefastferry tickets "},{"url":null,"title":"eilis ohanlon as a publicfunded broadcaster either it is impartial or it is not ","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The other is that it is not the BBCs place to tell licence fee payers what to think. Both are correct. Its certainly not necessary to share the views of those who still regard gay people as second class citizens, or who are uncomfortable with the reality that not everyone conforms to the same sexual or gender template. At the same time, it is not unreasonable to expect the BBC to stay out of the fight, not least whilst same-sex marriage remains such a bone of contention.Read MoreChurches ided on whether BBC should be taking part in PrideBBC NI denies that letting staff join Belfast Pride event risks its impartialityThe BBCs editorial guidelines do \"not require absolute neutrality on every issue\", but they make clear that \"where our content highlights issues on which others campaign, we must take care not to endorse those campaigns, or allow ourselves to be used to campaign to change public policy\". That sounds like an entirely sensible compromise.Of course, it could be argued that the BBC takes stances on any number of issues, even whilst pretending that it doesnt but at least the corporation usually makes a show of being impartial. In this case, theyll be taking part in what is billed openly as a \"weekend of protest\".Why then should the BBC not be equally free to back demands for a standalone Irish Language Act or second Brexit referendum Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetBBC employees are as entitled as any other person in Northern Ireland to hold whatever views they choose on political and social issues. If they want to take part as private citizens in the Pride march, or any other protest, thats their business.Gay people who work in the BBC should also be reassured that they are valued and protected.It is still misguided to use one of the countrys most powerful institutions as a propaganda battering ram, despite Section . of the guidelines requiring staff, presenters and \"others who contribute to our output\" to take due care that their \"external activities\", including social media use, dont raise concerns of a conflict of interest.How can those who hold conservative views on matters of sex and morality be confident they will be treated fairly by the BBC when the organisation has torn up these guidelines to put its official stamp on a campaign so antithetical to their views Traditionalists may well be on the wrong side of history, with polls here showing an encouraging two thirds support for same-sex marriage. The fact remains that many older people in Northern Ireland do still hold old-fashioned Christian views on homosexuality, and using the power and resources of the BBC to drag them reluctantly along the road to a rainbow-flagged Promised Land is just boorish. There are plenty of opinions held by the younger generation that future ages may judge them harshly for as well. Its not about who is right or wrong. Section  of the BBC code states explicitly that \"we should take account of the dferent political cultures and structures in dferent parts of the UK\". Either those words mean something, or they dont. The BBC has to be for everyone, not just those that bigwigs at the Beeb would be happy to invite to their dinner parties.Forgetting that mission is why the BBCs Director General Tony Hall was forced to admit back in March that the publics perception of the BBCs impartiality has \"weakened in recent years\". It really shouldnt take a genius to figure out why."},{"url":null,"title":"full of life and fun tributes paid to northern ireland chef who conquered kilimanjaro","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However it proved to be ineffective. \"Unfortunately cancer had other ideas,\" Teresa said. \"He went very quickly and it was all very peaceful. \"We will look back on it as his happy ending.\"She hailed her brother, who also spend time travelling in Canada and Thailand, as \"a good lad so full of le and fun\".

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

It was a place people passed through, not went to. But look whos laughing now.Four years,  lodges, , job applications and one extravagant fireworks show later, Center Parcs Ireland is open for business.The sprawling Ballymahon resort, one of the biggest investments ever made in Irish tourism, officially opens to the public on Monday, July .This weekend, however, the latest in a string of soft opening sessions saw some , invitees gather around a manmade lake - and a waterpark complex heated year-round to . degrees - for a weekend of freebies and fireworks.Baz Ashmawy was posing for PR shots in the pool.

Punters zip-lined over kayakers and SUPers on the lake. Whoops spilled from the Wild Water Rapids. Activities booked ranged from Bollywood dancing to indoor bowling.Lodges smelled new. Hundreds of little orange wasp-catching devices dangled from trees, and the accents of experienced UK staff could be heard all over - from the water slides to restaurants - helping their Irish colleagues settle in.\"This is probably the quickest we’ve built a park.

No s. No buts. No more delay. Brexit is happening,” he said.“The EU’s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach — it’s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it,” he added.“We still hope they will change their minds, but we must operate on the assumption that they will not.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Boris Johnson has reportedly put together a ‘war cabinet’ of six key ministers to deliver Brexit Mr Gove said the Government would do “everything in our power” to secure a good deal for the UK, but said simply presenting Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement to Parliament again would not be enough.“You can’t just reheat the dish that’s been sent back and expect that will make it more palatable,” he wrote.Planning for no deal was now a “number one priority”, he said, as the paper reported that Mr Johnson had put together a “war cabinet” of six key ministers to deliver Brexit by October  “by any means necessary”.Chancellor Sajid Javid has said there will be “signicant extra funding” this week to get Britain “fully ready to leave” the EU on October , with or without a deal.The additional spending will include financing one of the country’s “biggest ever public information campaigns” to ensure iniduals and businesses are ready for a no-deal exit, Mr Javid told the Sunday .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sajid Javid will announce new funding to prepare for a no-deal Brexit “Under my leadership, the Treasury will have new priorities and will play its full role in helping to deliver Brexit,” he said.“In my first day in office as Chancellor, I tasked officials to urgently identy where more money needs to be invested to get Britain fully ready to leave on October  – deal or no deal.”He added that he planned to fund  new Border Force officers and look at new infrastructure around the country’s ports to minimise congestion and ensure goods can flow.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said he was working on a cross-party alliance to prevent a no-deal Brexit.He told The Observer: “The political direction of travel under Boris Johnson is clear, and so it is more important than ever that we build a strong cross-party alliance to stop a no-deal Brexit.“That work will intensy over the summer, before parliament resumes in September.”Meanwhile, polls have suggested the Tories were boosted by a “Boris bounce” after the election of their new leader.Since Mr Johnson became Prime Minister after being declared party chief by Tory members, the Conservatives have gained  points to stand at %, a survey by Deltapoll for the Mail on Sunday showed.That puts them five points ahead of Labour at %, with the Liberal Democrats on % and the Brexit Party on %.ButLabour was to drop Jeremy Corbyn as leader, the poll says the party would shoot into the lead at %, with the Tories on %, the Brexit Party on % and the Lib Dems on %.The poll also found that opinion was evenly ided on the question of whether Mr Johnson’s partner Carrie Symonds should live with him at Number .While % backed such a move, the same number were opposed to it.Asked how they would feelMr Johnson married their daughter, % said they would be sad, while % said they would be happy.The poll came as Mr Johnson set out an eye-catching domestic stall promising a £. billion boost for left-behind towns.He also pledged funding for a new rail link between Manchester and

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face.

The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals. Even burning his hand while working on his car failed to dampen Tonerrsquos day.Camillus Bradley and Crawford Henderson claimed second in the category after early second-placed holder Wesley Patterson went out with a broken crown wheel and pinion.Round five of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Rally Championship will see a switch from tarmac to gravel as crews head to Co Fermanagh in September for the Lakeland Stages Rally.The series is beginning to heat up and a three-way fight for the crown is developing between Derek McGeehan, Derek McGarrity and Stephen Wright.

A minute later, Stuart Martin, who had been heavily watched all afternoon, flashed over a super score and followed it up with another.Not to be outdone Derry star Mullan found the space to register his fourth point of the evening.The introduction of Ciaran Watson, Michael McKey and Padraig Doran saw a fresh approach as the visitors started to claw their way back into this thrilling encounter.In the th minute Conor McCrickard plundered a second goal for his side and when Stuart Martin pointed two minutes later, Down were just a score away from levelling the contest.Richie Mullan gave the home side a four-point advantage with a brilliantly angled free out near the sideline.The outcome of the game turned when McAlornan blocked Mullan shot for goal.Derry only managed to score two more points in the remaining five minutes as an inspired Down side levelled the contest for the first time with a m Costello point.With referee Aidan Ferguson indicating there was to be four minutes of extra time, it was game on. Eoghan Cassidy edged the home side in front with a super effort from out on the left wing, only to see McCrickard level once more from a similar type angled dead ball score.Derry had spurned an opportunity of snatching the game when the Down rearguard pressurised Seaacuten Kelly into shooting wide.Fom the resulting puck-out a tussle for possession saw Niall Fitzsimmons flash the sliotar over the Derry crossbar.When the whistle finally blew five minutes over the , it was Down who had progressed to Semple Stadium.Down: C McAlornan, E Kelly, T Murray, A Dorrian, C Smith, R McCrickard, N McFarlane , N Fitzsimmons , P Savage, J Hanrahan, R Blair , T Prenter , R Costello , C McCrickard , S Martin .

Thirteen qualiers from regional shows came under scrutiny from Yorkshire judge Wendy Young. Mrs Young praised the quality line-up and awarded the £ top prize to the fourth calved Holstein cow Robinview Atwood Vicky  EX owned in a four-way split by Mark Henry, Andrew Kennedy, Lindsey Fleming and David Simpson. Antrim Show also played host to the Aberdeen Angus Ulster Championship, the NI Limousin Championship, the NI Dexter Group’s Premier Show, and the final of the Bank of Ireland and NI British Blue Heer Championship.Top honours in the interbreed beef line-up went to the Shorthorn cow Ricketstown Lovely exhibited by Duncan McDowell from Newtownards. This four-year-old cow was interbreed champion at Balmoral in May, and was shown with her January born Elliott Matrix heer calf at foot.Taking the reserve championship ribbons was the Limousin cow Culnagechan Liberty exhibited by Herbie and Stephen Crawford from Maguiresbridge. She was crowned breed champion, while her February born heer calf, by the ,gns Culnagechan Lazio, won the reserve Limousin championship. Scottish judge Garry Patterson was impressed with the beef cattle classes at the show. “There were some strong classes. The Beef Shorthorn cow really caught my eye, while the Limousin is another tremendous brood cow. These are both hard-working suckler cows, rearing good calves.”Cumbria judge John Sinnett placed the interbreed sheep classes at the show. He awarded top honours to a Bluefaced Leicester ewe exhibited by Michelle Wright from Ballymena. Runner-up was a Suffolk Cheviot ewe lamb shown by James Alexander of Randalstown. Thousands flocked to the show and society chairman Fred Duncan was delighted with the success of the day. “The weather has been fantastic, and we have attracted thousands of exhibitors and spectators from across the country and further afield,” he said.“Entries were strongly supported in the livestock, equine and home industries section. We are indebted to Randox, Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, and our numerous sponsors for their continued financial support.”Murder investigation launched after Sunday morning stabbing in Milton Keynes Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The action-packed itinerary included entertainment for all ages, with bouncy castles, dog ability display, jiving competition, Kidz Farm, sheep shearing, YFCU county games, treasure hunt, and the hotly contested pet show.

Is he really planning to be so radical, or is he already thinking of a Brexit compromise In Northern Ireland earlier this month for the Tory hustings, he met Arlene Foster and tweeted: “If I become PM, under no circumstances will there be a hard border on the island of Ireland, nor will I accept a deal that sees NI taken out of the UK’s customs territory.”This was familiar language. Last September the News Letter asked Downing Street why Theresa May had moved from saying there would be no Irish Sea border to saying that there would be no such customs border. This left open the possibility of a regulatory border . Number  told us Mrs May would not accept”seeing NI carved away from the UK customs territory” but failed to answer our question, and confirmed rather than allayed such fears. Sure enough, the November Withdrawal Agreement had a regulatory border.Was Mr Johnson, who for all his shambolic reputation is a skilled wordsmith, revealing that he too will align NI to EU regulations  If so, his radical government is in fact an English nationalist one, that will take England and Wales completely out of all EU structures, regardless of the consequences for rest of UK.Or perhaps not. The journalist Charles Moore, Mr Johnson’s editor at the Daily , thinks the latter’s unionism is genuine.If that is so, Julian Smith has urgent work to do as secretary of state.Eighteen months ago I wrote about the need for a pro Union culture at the Northern Ireland Office to counter Ireland’s partisan Department of Foreign Affairsand its Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tanaiste Simon Coveney .Little has been done to make things more dficult for terrorists Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Both James Brokenshire and Karen Bradley were hopelessly incapable of standing up to the DFA.When Dublin delighted republicans by taking the hooded men case to humiliating defeat at the European Court of Human Rights, to get UK treatment of the men designated torture, despite advance signals from the court that Ireland would lose, NIO ministers didn’t even welcome the verdict.When Dublin embarrassed Britain by laying legacy cases before the Council of Europe, including the Pat Finucane murder, which has had millions spent on it and is a key example of the legacy imbalance, NIO ministers were mute.When Simon Coveney said the detention of the dissident Tony Taylor was fuelling community tensions in Londonderry, Karen Bradley said nothing — not even that while she could not discuss any inidual case, she would always as one of her highest priorities try to ensure the protection of le and property from terrorism.When Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney have given a running commentary on British failures over Brexit, UK ministers have said nothing.When Mr Coveney at his joint press conference with Karen Bradley said “we” decided not to have an outside facilitator, she said nothing.When it was reported that a civil servant got £, damages because portraits of the Queen were displayed at Stormont House, NIO ministers said nothing.When Mrs Bradley said that no British soldiers committed crimes during the Troubles instead of almost none of them did, Mr Coveney joined the chorus of criticism. Try to think of a British minister criticising an Irish one in this fashion.Mr Smith could end the sense of joint London-Dublin stewardship by insisting on strict adherence to the three strands principle in talks, evenunionists do not. He could reinstate the portraits and make clear that any new complaints will be fought to the Supreme Court and,that fails, then the law will be changed.He could show that the UK alone will decide on a facilitator and alone implement oversee direct ruleSinn Fein’s Stormont veto persists.The UK has sovereignty over Northern Ireland and solely funds it — and lavishly so.

Mr Stewart said: “The comments of Mary Lou McDonald on Friday demonstrate clearly that Sinn Fein don’t understand the Belfast Agreement and don’t care about insulting unionists, in spite of what they might say about ‘rights and respect’.“After meeting the new Secretary of State Julian Smith, she was said to have asked him about the ‘threshold’ for calling a poll on Irish reunication and told him she hoped he would be ‘the last British secretary of state’. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “Perhapsshe says it often enough she might even be able to persuade herself that she believes it to be true, but she is fooling nobody .” Mr Stewart added: “As a unionist, that is what I would expect a republican to say, but she joins the latest in a long line of Sinn Fein politicians and Irish republicans who are detached from reality. I can recall Gerry Adams predicting Irish unity by , and look how that worked out.“The Sinn Fein leader also presented the new secretary of state with a copy of the Belfast Agreement. She might have been better off keeping it, becauserecent comments are anything to go by, clearly a lot of her party colleagues haven’t read – or certainly haven’t understood – the section which guarantees the principle of consent and Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom, for as long as a majority of the people who live here wish.“Rather than engage in soundbites and rhetoric designed to persuade the Sinn Fein base that all is still on track, Sinn Fein would be better served by dropping red lines and getting Stormont back to work, so that local politicians can begin to tackle the massive problems facing our health service and our children’s education in particular.”Meanwhile, Ms McDonald said an all-Ireland forum on Irish unity should be convened without delay.Momentum is building around the constitutional sht and there should be political, institutional and legislative arrangements in place to manage that, the Sinn Fein president added.On Friday, Irish premier Leo Varadkar said moderate unionists and nationalists could be spurred to consider a united Irelandthere is a no-deal Brexit but it would be provocative for his government to begin making preparations now.Ms McDonald said: “The taoiseach must make clear that in the event of no-deal Brexit that Irish unity is the solution to averting a hard border on our island.“A referendum on unity is expressly provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, an agreement that was endorsed by the people of this island, north and south, overwhelmingly over  years ago.Sammy Wilson: Simon Coveney used a British parliament to insult a British PM Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“There is nothing provocative about wanting a united Ireland and the government has a responsibility to lead from the front.”Mr Varadkar said those uncomfortable with a “nationalistic” Britain which is potentially considering reintroducing the death penalty could join forces to support Irish unity and continued membership of the EU.He said it would be provocative for the Irish government to take steps towards engineering a united Ireland now and the country simply wants to maintain the status quo.Ms McDonald said: “There is a momentum building for Irish unity and we need political, institutional and legislative arrangements in place to manage that.“That preparation must include the convening of an all-Ireland forum on Irish unity without delay.“With the threat of a crash Brexit now a live prospect, it is irresponsible not to prepare for constitutional change.”try catch  TrendinglsquoBeautulrsquo Danika McGuigan passes away after lsquobraversquo cancer

She will also be supported by Cllr Mark Wilson, who was elected deputy town mayor.Cllr Thomas succeeds Cllr Jon Luxton as town mayor and thanks were offered to Cllr Luxton for the dedication shown by himself, his mayoress and his consort over the past year.Cllr Thomas will be fundraising throughout her year in office. Her nominated charity is the National Autistic Society Cardf and Vale branch, a cause close to her heart.Cllr Thomas said: ldquoFirstly, Irsquod like to express my thanks to everyone for coming and to my fellow councillors for their support.ldquoCongratulations to Mark Wilson and Rhiannon Birch as his consort, Irsquom looking forward to working with them, but especially want to thank them in advance, for attending any events on my behalf.ldquoA special thank you to my friends and family who continue to support me, without their support over the years I wouldnrsquot have undertaken or been able to do the many things that I have.ldquoI especially want to thank Emma Ross for agreeing to be my mayoress, I know we will have lots of interesting and fun experiences, also Irsquom very lucky to have friends who are happy to volunteer.ldquoWith the more family orientated mayoral events my six-year-old son, Ben, will enjoy joining us. This will be a good opportunity for him to gain a bigger appreciation of the ersity of people in Penarth, and help him to understand that the roles we fulfil are not restricted to any particular demographic.ldquoBy and large, this is one of the biggest honours Irsquove undertaken, and I am looking forward to the challenge. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And Irsquove also been talking about sport ndash this time football and ensuring young people can get involved in teams, but also have opportunities to progress within their chosen sport as well.In Westminster Irsquove been talking about serious violence and ensuring we get police on our streets to deal with kne crime and other violence, which sadly wersquove seen on the rise in some parts of the UK.Irsquove also been talking about the steel industry. Steel is a crucial backbone here in Wales, but there is worrying news from some parts of the industry across the UK. Irsquom glad to say that we have a thriving steel plant here in the constituency, employing a lot of people who produce steel for our construction industry and many other infrastructure projects ndash but itrsquos crucial that those projects are open to Welsh steel, in order to drive jobs and business here in our local community.In the Commons I challenged the Conservative Welsh Secretary over what I believe is his failure to stand up for our steel industry.I asked him: ldquoSteel is of course the foundation of any successful industrial strategy.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

The pension applies to both Vale and Cardf council workers.Friends of the Earth Cymru congratulated the council.Spokeswoman Bleddyn Lake said: ldquoAfter years of lobbying by Friends of the Earth, itrsquos fantastic to see Cardf councillors taking the historic decision to stop supporting the fossil fuel companies that are fuelling the climate crisis.ldquoNow itrsquos time for all the local authority pension funds in Wales to follow Cardfrsquos lead.ldquoToo many have been hiding away from taking meaningful action, but a climate emergency means we cannot afford to be investing money in the very companies driving climate change.ldquoResearch has shown esting from fossil fuel companies is better financially and will minimise future financial risks for those with pensions in these funds.ldquoClimate change is the challenge of our age. We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
