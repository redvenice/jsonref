That hurts,’ he said.The Duke added of the Press: ‘Unfortunately, if the source of information is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society.’In an extra clip that did not make the final two-hour cut, Oprah asks Harry if they left the UK because of racism to which he replied: ‘It was a large part of it.’In more additional footage, Meghan said her treatment in the Press had been worse than Kate’s, saying: ‘If a member of his family would comfortably say “we’ve all had to deal with things that are rude”, rude and racist are not the same.’   Royal warfare erupted after Harry and Meghan revealed deeply private and confidential conversations with the royal family to a US journalist friend after they appeared on Oprah, despite claiming it would be their \u0027final word\u0027 on their rift with the royals.The couple told breakfast show host Gayle King the prince had finally spoken to his father and brother - and she went on a major TV network to disclose that the talks ‘were not productive’.Miss King also suggested that Meghan was unhappy that no-one in the Royal Family had picked up the phone to her yet following their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey.And in a thinly-veiled threat, the broadcaster said Meghan had made clear she has ‘documents to back up everything she said on Oprah’s interview’.The fact that the couple chose to discuss such sensitive discussions between senior members of the royal family with a TV journalist, who broadcast them blow-by-blow within hours, met with an icy response from Buckingham Palace. Prince William has insisted that the Royal Family were not racists after Meghan claimed one of them had raised ‘concerns’ about ‘how dark’ her baby’s skin would be, and suggested that they tried to deprive Archie of a title and security because he was of mixed race.She also claimed she had been given so little support by the palace that she suffered suicidal thoughts.For his part, Harry said he felt ‘really let down’ by his father, accused him of cutting him off financially and refusing to take his calls, while revealing there was a gulf between himself and William. In recent days there have been a handful of stories published in the UK reporting that Charles and William felt hurt by what Harry had said, but with very little detail on what was taking place behind the scenes.That was turned on its head when Miss King, who attended Meghan’s lavish baby shower in New York in 2019 and is Miss Winfrey’s closest friend, decided to speak out on her prime time morning show on CBS, the same channel that broadcast the Sussexes’ interview.Harry was accused of ‘embarrassing’ hypocrisy this week for speaking to CBS, which caused outrage in 2004 by showing a photograph of his mother dying in a 1997 car crash in Paris.Miss King told viewers she had called Harry and Meghan at their £10 million California home ‘over the weekend’ to discuss the fall-out from the interview and revealed that they had told her details of their intimate conversations.She said: ‘Well I’m not trying to break news, but I did actually call them to see how they were feeling, and it’s true, Harry has talked to his brother and he has talked to his father too.‘The word I was given was that those conversations were not productive. But they are glad that they have at least started a conversation.’Miss King also claimed that the couple were unhappy that ‘the palace’ had apparently been leaking what they believed were untrue stories to the media, adding: ‘And I think what is still upsetting to them is the palace keep saying they want to work it out privately, but yet, they believe these false stories are coming out that are very disparaging against Meghan, still.’She made clear that the Duchess was unhappy that no-one in the family had called her, despite her making a string of highly inflammatory allegations against several of them in her interview and revealing details of what had been a private conversation between her husband and a family member in which it was alleged an offensive comment had been made.‘No one in the Royal Family has talked to Meghan yet, at this particular time,’ she said.The Sussexes effectively accused the Royal Family and Buckingham Palace of institutional racism in their interview with Miss Winfrey.But Miss King claimed they felt ‘frustrated’ that much of the coverage had focused on this - when they had apparently only wanted to provoke the monarchy into taking action against the media, which they believe has a racist agenda against Meghan.‘I think it’s frustrating for them to see that it’s a racial conversation about the Royal Family when all they wanted all along was for the royals to intervene and tell the Press to stop with the unfair, inaccurate, false stories that definitely have a racial slant,’ Miss King said.‘And until you can acknowledge that, I think it’s going to be hard to move forward. But they both want to move forward with this and they both want healing in this family. At the end of the day, that is Harry’s family.’The broadcaster also raised the investigation launched earlier this month by Buckingham Palace into how claims of bullying against Meghan lodged by a senior member of palace staff were handled.Her former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, complained in 2018 that she had driven out two PAs with her behaviour and was targeting other female members of staff, but nothing was apparently ever done in response to his allegations.Miss King says: ‘The bullying thing was raised in 2018 and now there’s an ongoing investigation about bullying from Meghan Markle, when anyone who has worked with her will tell you exactly who she is. You know, she’s really a very sweet, caring person.’She added: ‘And as I say, Meghan has documents to back up everything that she said on Oprah’s interview. Everything.’In a further discussion about the ongoing family strife and how to resolve it, Miss King seemed to suggest that Harry and Meghan were not satisfied by Buckingham Palace’s response to their bombshell interview and the claims in it.She said: ‘The family has to acknowledge that there are issues. And right now, no-one has acknowledged, “Houston, we have a problem here”. That’s really all they want. They want a conversation. They both want a conversation.’There was no immediate reaction from the Sussexes’s team of PR people - either in London or California - about whether Miss King was speaking at their request.But as one of their closest friends and media allies in the US, it is unthinkable, say insiders, that they would not have at least been aware that she may choose to brief it.Royals aides appeared to be genuinely horrified that either the duke or duchess would personally choose to tell anyone, let alone a television journalist, about intimate and highly confidential conversations that Harry was having with his closest family.They fail to see how it will go any way towards repairing their damaged relationships or rebuilding the family’s shattered trust - on either side.One said: ‘The only positive we can take out of this is that at least they are talking. It would be better from now on, however, if that could be done in private space.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Biden asks Education Secretary legally cancel 50K student debt","story":"Share this articlePlaybook with White House chief of staff Ron Klain - POLITICO"},{"url":null,"title":"The conspiracy theory wont rest peace","story":"Share this article The nearest seismograph monitoring station was in Palisades, New York, 12 miles from downtown Manhattan, which recorded crucial signals from the North Tower.These show — according to the Campbells\u0027 dossier — that seismic data (indicating explosions) was recorded 15 seconds earlier than the official time given for the moment the hijacked plane struck the building: 40 seconds after the clock struck 8.40 am.A dozen reports by scientists, seismologists and engineers, provided in the dossier support the contention that explosives and incendiary devices were planted in both skyscrapers before the events of 911 as the world understands them ever happened.And there is something else that remains unexplained — the abrupt collapse of a third tower at the World Trade Centre of which many will never have heard.The building, WTC7, collapsed in just seven seconds, even though no plane had hit it.It stood 100 yards from the 110-storey Twin Towers, housed offices of the U.S. secret service and was city mayor Rudy Giuliani\u0027s emergency command centre, fitted with secure air supplies and bullet and bomb-resistant windows.Bystanders interviewed by U.S. television that day reported hearing \u0027bang, bang, bang\u0027 sounds before it fell, although official inquiries say there is no evidence of any controlled explosion.Conspiracy theorists have long held that the events of 911 were deliberately fabricated to fool the world and provide a perfect pretext for America to hunt down Osama bin Laden\u0027s Al-Qaeda organisation and start the so-called War On Terror.But Matt, Geoff\u0027s brother, says he and his family are not interested in conspiracies — they just want to find out the truth.Matt, a theoretical physicist and now a reflexologist, explains: \u0027Geoff and Caroline had just got engaged three weeks before. I mourn that he never had his own family. He has not seen my kids or our younger brother Rob\u0027s children grow up.\u0027For Caroline, his fiancee, their life together ended that day. Geoff deserves justice and so does she.\u0027At their New York apartment, Caroline, now 51, remembers the morning she last saw Geoff. They were a happy couple, spending holidays abroad and enjoying life.Geoff was \u0027bouncing around\u0027 in good spirits, searching for his trousers and grabbing something to eat from the fridge before he left for the conference.Soon afterwards, relatives and friends began to ring to ask if Geoff was OK because a plane had hit a skyscraper in New York.\u0027Wasn\u0027t he at a conference there?\u0027 they asked.From her apartment, with a view of the Twin Towers, Caroline then watched a second plane collide with the South Tower.\u0027I sat by the phone waiting for Geoff to call,\u0027 she remembers. \u0027People were ringing from England and when I heard their accents I thought it was him.\u0027In the nightmarish hours that followed, Caroline tried to persuade herself Geoff was alive. Even when the South Tower disappeared from the skyline, followed by the North Tower, she kept hoping.She took her fiance\u0027s photograph to hospitals to search for him.\u0027I looked everywhere for days on end, thinking he must have survived,\u0027 she says. \u0027I feel he will have been positive to the end. I hope he died instantly.\u0027Why didn\u0027t Geoff call her before the North Tower collapsed? She surmises that his mobile may have run out or been lost in all the mayhem.In retrospect, she says, his silence was for the best. She would not have wanted to hear him with panic in his voice as he realised the danger he was in.At the time of the atrocity, Caroline was about to set up a U.S. wing of a British IT company. After Geoff\u0027s death, her career changed course. She joined the military police and has just completed a master\u0027s degree in healthcare administration.She has rarely dated since her fiance\u0027s death.\u0027I think about Geoff every single day,\u0027 she says of the man she met in a Manhattan bar and teased about his English accent before they got together as a couple. \u0027I still wait for him to come home.\u0027In England, Geoff\u0027s repatriated remains are buried in a pretty graveyard which the family visit regularly.

There is even a 38-stop route des fromages through the region, with road signs featuring cheese wheels directing drivers to 38 dairies and farm producers that make some of the country’s finest cheeses. Among the area’s most recognised contributions to French fromage are its blue cheeses of these, probably the best known to people in the UK is Saint Agur. This rich, tangy cheese is made in Beauzac, located beside the Loire in the Haute-Loire department, south-central France. It’s a “pretty, medieval village”, says Saint Agur’s fromagerie director Ludovic d’Eysmond, who describes a picturesque scene, where a church and ramparts “create a beautiful square in the centre of the village”. All of its milk comes from within 45 miles of the village, largely from farms in nearby hamlets, nestled on the side of the dormant volcanoes that are characteristic of the area’s terrain. Milk is provided by Montbéliarde cows, a breed prized among French cheesemakers because the protein levels of their milk produce higher yields of cheese than milk from other cows. They graze outside every other day, weather permitting. The heritage of Auvergne’s blue cheese dates back to the mid-1850s, when a local cheesemaker noticed the tastiness of the blue mould that would sometimes appear on his cheese curds. After experimenting, he realised that if he injected the mould, it would cause veining throughout the cheese. All of the area’s cheeses have characteristics that make them stand out inidually. Saint Agur is prized for the way it balances tangy notes with creamy, almost mushroom-like richness, whereas others are known for flavours that range from grassy notes that are almost woodlandy, through to borderline spiciness in some of the more powerfully moulded offerings. But one thing many of Auvergne’s better cheeses have in common is that they are ripened in some form of underground caves Saint Agur, for instance, spends 10 weeks in Beauzac caves. The rocks that create those special flavour-maturing conditions are largely volcanic, created by the dormant giants now covered in pasture that the cows graze upon.

Another area where fungi, particularly moulds, are important is in the production of popular foods. Soy sauce, fermented meats and cheeses are just some of the foods that owe their existence to mould. But it is in cheese, especially blue cheese, that mould plays its most recognised and, arguably, delicious role. The origins of blue cheese are vague, but the story goes that, in the seventh century, a shepherd in the southern French village of Roquefort (literally meaning “strong rock”) left his lunch of bread and sheep’s cheese in a cave when distracted by a local girl he saw in the distance. Many months later, the same shepherd apparently stumbled on his abandoned meal only to find it contaminated with Penicillium roqueforti, a mould that grew within the cave’s soil. It is not clear why the shepherd decided to consume his rediscovered meal, but since then Penicillium roqueforti has become a mould typically used in many blue cheese varieties, especially Saint Agur. The origins of blue cheese may be a myth, but the science of how Penicillium roqueforti is responsible for the flavour of Saint Agur and all other blue cheeses is just as fascinating as any legend. What is mould? As with other fungi, mould is found in natural environments that are damp and rich in nutrients (forest soil, wood and, of course, caves). Moulds are decomposers, which means they break down organic materials that other species, such as invertebrates, struggle to digest. In doing so, they release into the soil soluble nutrients that plants and trees use to grow. Unlike plants, mould does not reproduce through seeds but rather spores, the dusty stuff that appears on top of mould, which floats through the air when released and begins to germinate when the microscopic particles land in hospitable environments. The spores then produce interwoven, thread-like structures known as hyphae, which become what are called mycelium when massed together. Mycelia are considered single organisms, but they can stretch underground for considerable distances. In fact, recent research has shown that the mycelia of some fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant and tree roots, resulting in underground networks where the host plants can exchange nutrients, water and information. These networks are called mycorrhizae and are often likened to the internet and have been called the “wood wide web”. Their existence is forcing the scientific world to rethink their understanding of plants more generally. Penicillium roqueforti is part of the same genus (Penicillium) as the key mould species used in many modern antibiotics. First identified by the Scottish bacteriologist Sir Alexander Fleming as a potential agent in the fight against infection in 1928, it took another 10 years for a team of scientists at the University of Oxford to develop the world’s first antibiotic compounds from moulds such as Penicillium chrysogenum (sometimes known as Penicillium notatum) and Penicillium rubens. The mould itself does not kill bacteria but produces penicillin as a natural product, which attacks the cell walls of a wide range of bacteria. So what does this have to do with cheese?To create blue cheese, there are a variety of methods used by cheesemakers for different cheese types. Some still rely on mother nature and simply age their cheese in clement environments where the mould will naturally infect the wheels. Saint Agur, for instance, matures for 10 weeks in caves to allow for the mould to grow and give Saint Agur its unique taste and texture. Most manufactures, however, introduce powdered Penicillium roqueforti cultures to the cheese milk before the milk is coagulated and the curd is separated from the whey. Once the cheese has been moulded into shape, it is left to mature. It is at this point, in the early stages of the maturing process, that stainless steel rods are forced into the cheese to permit exchange between oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide produced by the mould in the cheese’s interior. This encourages the growth of mould and gives rise to the characteristic blue-green veins that run through this type of cheese. It is the presence of the mould and the enzymes it produces that are responsible for the colour, flavour and texture of the cheese. The mould raises the acidity (pH level) of the cheese, which changes its texture and flavour, while also breaking down proteins in the cheese to give it a softer, creamier consistency. The moulds also have a strong lipolytic action that breaks down fats, producing fatty acids, known as ketones, that give the cheese its rich flavour and powerful aroma. So next time you reach for some Saint Agur, remember that the mould has put a lot of work into making it the ideal companion for your crackers.

Sattouf, whose autobiographical graphic novel The Arab of the Future was a  book of the year, met the real Esther – whose identity is disguised to protect her anonymity – when his friends, her parents, brought her to dinner. “She chattered the whole time telling stories about her school and friends and things that were happening to her. She was like a radio, talking away. It was enormously interesting to hear her talking about her life and I thought it would be amusing to do a book about her world,” Sattouf says. “I’ve not met many children who speak that much to others. They talk to their parents, but there she was talking away, describing her world with a large vocabulary. The first thing that struck me was the relationship between the boys and girls at that age. She started recounting all these stories about how boys behaved, boys who were considered handsome, those that should be kept away from … I thought, this is actually very funny. “I decided I would do a book every year until she was 18, and it would be interesting to see someone grow up. At the time, I was writing the second volume of Arab of the Future and recounting my life as a child growing up in Syria in the 1980s – I wanted to do a parallel project showing a girl of today and what there might be in common.” Most parents will admit, if pressed, that they have no idea what goes on in their children’s minds or their lives outside the home. From speaking to the real Esther, Sattouf offers some hints: she thinks that her friends who own iPhones are “rich” that Beyoncé is “blonde and bendy” (and therefore her hero) she loves her dad, but thinks her 14-year-old brother Antoine, with whom she shares a room, is “a bit stupid … but that’s normal for a boy”. Boys are a recurring theme: “I don’t know what to say about boys except that we don’t talk about them because they’re, you know, boys,” says Esther in one story, which finishes with the caption: “In the end, everybody cried. So that’s what boys are like. Bad.” And some quite hardcore swearing: “At school we can talk to each other how we want. It’s not like being at home, where you’re not allowed to swear,” she says on the very first page, followed by a stream of expletives. Sattouf, who is also a film-maker – his movie Les Beaux Gosses (The French Kissers) won a César – was born in France, to a Syrian father and French mother. As a child, he lived first in Libya, then in his father’s birthplace, Ter Maaleh, a town of 7,700 in central Syria. His parents orced when he was 11, and his mother moved back to France with Sattouf and his brother. Sattouf is in contact with the real Esther every week and conveys her view of the world. Her particular charm, he says, is that she is so ordinary. “The real Esther interested me because she is a girl without a particular background,” he says. “She has no family problems, her parents are together, she is not poor or rich, not stunningly beautiful nor plain, not super-intelligent but good at school. She is your average young girl without any particular backstory. I wanted to know what was in her head. Listening to her stories, I realised that they were hard, amusing and sometimes cruel, but they transmitted the reality of childhood.” Although there are very specific French references – including the rapper Black M, and singers Maître Gims and TAL – Daniel Seton, the book’s UK publisher at Pushkin Press, says the stories are universal. “It’s an unfiltered look into modern childhood and not exclusively French. The way Esther grows up, interacts with social media, worries about terrorism, sexism, racism and questions of having or not having money, speaks to an universal audience. It’s rare children have a chance to speak in such an unfiltered way,” Seton said. In France the next Esther book, covering her 15th year, will be published in June. Her stories have already been translated into Italian, German, Spanish, Serbian and Greek. Seton plans to publish two more Esther collections this year, while Sattouf’s next and final volume of Arab of the Future comes out in French in June next year. Meanwhile, the real Esther remains anonymous. “I told her it was her story and she could tell who she wanted, but that it might be better to keep it a secret,” Sattouf says. “It was funny because sometimes at her birthday parties friends would offer her the books as a present, without knowing she was the real Esther. Reality caught up with her, but she couldn’t tell them.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d54cb14669930e7b05f7b353aa55624d6135b15/190_0_2857_1716/master/2857.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTEucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=beb92a174dabd662efd2ffff7eabd8d5","title":"england euro 2020 squad gareth southgate scotland fans wembley","story":"The England manager took nine defenders to Russia for the World Cup and his plans for this summer will be shaped by his desire to set up in either a 4-3-3 or 3-4-3 formation, meaning players who can operate in more than one role could be important. For the World Cup in 2018 Southgate was fixed in his intention to play 3-5-2. Southgate reverted to a back four for the World Cup qualifying wins against San Marino, Albania and Poland, influenced by the fact it allows him to get an extra forward‑thinking player on the pitch. Kyle Walker moved from the right of the defensive three to right-back and Southgate referenced Walker’s flexibility while also noting that the left‑backs Ben Chilwell and Luke Shaw could operate on the left of a three. The trio appear certain to be selected for the European finals, together with Harry Maguire and John Stones – leaving Southgate potentially to pick three defenders from the right-backs Kieran Trippier and Reece James and the centre-halves Conor Coady and Tyrone Mings. Eric Dier retains hopes of being involved while Trent Alexander-Arnold is out of favour. “Heading into Russia we were very clear we were going to be 3-5-2 and that we were going to pick the players to fit that system. We’re a bit more fluid and adaptable now and we’d like to cover some different possibilities. We have some exciting wide players and players who can come in off the line and play as an attacking 8 or 10. We’ve got to find a way of getting them into the squad.” Southgate’s options in those areas are extensive, taking in Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford, Mason Mount, Phil Foden, Jadon Sancho, Jack Grealish, Bukayo Saka, Harvey Barnes and Jesse Lingard. It is inevitable some will be disappointed, together with players in other positions, and Southgate said he would communicate openly across the remainder of the season to ensure any bad news did not come as a shock. “I’ve spoken to quite a few already this week and I will do over the next couple of weeks so that they know exactly where they sit because I think that’s helpful,” he said. “You’ve got to manage expectations and have some reality about what they might need to do between now and the end of the season.” Southgate was asked whether he had decided between a back three and a four. “Very good question,” he replied. “Some of that is going to depend a little bit on availability of certain players. We’ve got to have that flexibility. Ideally you want to get attacking players on the pitch and that’s harder with a back three. But there is that balance of making sure we are not open at the back.” The search is on for clues as to the composition of what Southgate calls his “batting order” in the various positions and Kalvin Phillips provided one when he said James Ward‑Prowse was supposed to start ahead of him against Poland on Wednesday.  “I think Ward-Prowse was going to play and pulled out injured on Tuesday night,” Phillips said. “I didn’t actually know until Wednesday morning that Ward-Prowse wasn’t playing. It was a quick turnaround and a little bit surprising. But I always feel ready.” Meanwhile, a small number of Scotland fans will be at Wembley for the Euro 2020 match against England after it was confirmed that travel to London from Scotland would be allowed under the Covid road map. Uefa said recently that only domestic fans would be allowed at group matches, with the hope this would be relaxed during the knockout rounds, and the UK government is happy this fits with that policy. "},{"url":null,"title":"its nip and tuck the championships final wild dash for promotion","story":"“We’re going into the vital end of the season,” says Steve Cooper, the Swansea manager. “OK, there are still three points a game but it feels like there’s more on it than there has been in previous phases of the season. We’ve got to embrace the challenge. It’s all about grabbing the opportunity with both hands, making the most of it and trying not to have any regrets.” A couple of teams made the most of the last phase of the season, and Swansea were not one of them. Instead it was Norwich who emerged from the pack with an irresistible surge, taking such a dominant position that the prospect of them faltering seems remote. With eight games remaining they have 83 points, as many as West Brom needed to win promotion last season, and across the past 20 years the average tally required to go up – to finish one point ahead of third place – is 83.8. One statistic demonstrates how extraordinary Norwich’s recent form has been: on 12 February, Watford were seven points behind them, since when the Hornets have won nine out of 10 games. The run has transformed their own promotion chances, vaulting them from nine points behind Brentford to seven ahead, and from five behind Swansea to six ahead. But at the end of it they are further away from Norwich than they were at the start: the Canaries have also won nine of their last 10, but unlike the Hornets they drew the other. Behind them both, Barnsley won nine out of 11 to rise from mid-table into the top six, and will compete with Reading, Bournemouth, Cardiff and any late breakers from the pack for the remaining play-off places. Barnsley are unexpected challengers, and have been helped by Valérien Ismaël’s willingness to take full advantage of this season’s five permitted substitutions. He says the rule “gives you the possibility to have more impact on the game and to decide what is going on”, and no team in the Football League have made more than their 152 substitutions (equally notably, only Accrington Stanley and Lincoln have used fewer than Swansea’s 88). Norwich’s emergence has taken few by surprise but Watford had offered no hint of consistent excellence before mid-February, when the squad convened a meeting at which they aired and set aside their grievances while an injury to Troy Deeney forced a change of shape and emphasis. The result was instant improvement, and they are the only team with an even vague chance of overhauling the leaders. “With the games they’ve got left, Norwich have got enough points to be in the top two,” says the former Watford striker Tommy Mooney, who has covered most of their games this season. “But the teams underneath will think that the championship’s not over. They’ve got a big lead but by the end of this weekend it could be down to just a few points, and that’s how quickly it can happen – because this weekend is renowned in the Championship for making or breaking a season.” The international break has allowed those promotion-chasing sides whose form was faltering to take stock and prepare for one final heave. “I always say look forward, not back, and we’ll continue with that approach,” says Cooper, whose side have lost their past two games and have had only six shots on target across their past four. “We’re in great shape in terms of our atmosphere and our self-belief. There’s everything to play for, nothing to be afraid of, and we’ve got to be positive about how we go about it.” A certain amount of fear is perhaps inevitable at Brentford given their experience last season, when they won eight games in a row to push themselves to the verge of promotion before losing their last two to miss out by two points. “It’s the same as the restart last season, when we had nine games to really make a go of it and gave everybody a real shock,” says Marcus Gayle, who started his career at Brentford and covers many of their games. “The rest of this season’s going to be down to experience and mentality. The players have had that tough experience of not going up, but they’ve learned from that and moved on.” They have also recruited the wildly prolific Ivan Toney, who is four away from registering the highest-scoring season in the second tier since Guy Whittingham in 1992-93, and has either scored or assisted 37 goals in 36 league appearances. Brentford and Swansea will be encouraged by Watford’s relatively fiendish fixtures – the average current league position of the Hornets’ remaining opponents is 8.6, compared with 11.8 for Brentford and 13.3 for Swansea – and both play Xisco Muñoz’s side in the final fortnight. “It looks like first place is gone,” says Gayle, “but Watford have got to play a lot of really strong sides. They’ve got a really tough end to the season. We can’t afford to drop any more points, it’s now about building that winning mentality.” There is surely every reason to be optimistic, because if the past two months have proved anything it is that over the next two months everything could still change. “There’s going to be to-ing and fro-ing, nip and tuck,” says Cooper. “You’ve just got to be on the right side of the vital moments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00613fa35e5249b90f5d941c235f03fefd6b5b32/0_116_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=760035cd123fd02a59ffaf6631ed1619","title":"uk pledges extra 250m for hi tech research collaboration with eu","story":"Universities welcomed the move as “a significant affirmation of the government’s belief in research” which would avert the immediate threat to UK science. A statement from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, announcing the additional funding, said: “This investment reinforces the government’s commitment to putting research and development at the heart of plans to build back better from the pandemic. “It will support vital and pioneering research while enabling the UK’s brilliant scientists, researchers and businesses to access and benefit from the world’s largest collaborative research programme, Horizon Europe – worth about €95bn (£80bn) over the next decade.” The UK retained participation in Horizon Europe as part of its trade deal with the EU, but university leaders feared the government would not contribute the cost of taking part and would instead seek to fund it from existing research budgets. The cost of participation was previously part of the UK’s EU membership fees. University leaders warned such a move would amount to an effective cut in excess of £1bn, equivalent to cutting more than 18,000 full-time academic research posts and weakening the UK’s appeal as a destination for talented researchers and private and foreign investment. “Given current pressures on public finances, this is a significant affirmation of the government’s belief in research, recognising the pivotal role it plays in the UK’s current and future prosperity, and ensuring UK universities will remain at the forefront of efforts to address the most pressing global challenges.” Dr Tim Bradshaw, CEO of the Russell Group of universities, said: “Providing additional funding for Horizon Europe to protect core R\u0026ampD budgets is a good move by government and underlines its determination to establish Britain as a global science superpower. “Scientists and researchers have been a vital part in the emergency response to Covid-19 and this continued investment in UK science will pay idends as we work to deliver our joint ambitions for the country – high-value jobs and growth and a greener, healthier economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db4242c07fe28fe858ab3582e7254f84e3022e62/72_0_2298_1380/master/2298.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0ddb9972e977557b33a27f9d6f8cb4b5","title":"derek chauvin trial george floyd joe biden infrastructure coronavirus covid live","story":"– Joan E Greve and Maanvi SinghThe former president’s first full cabinet meeting in June 2017 remains an unparalleled opera of oleaginousness. Secretary after secretary all but flung themselves at his feet, sang songs of praise and paid homage to the ine emperor of the universe. Has any parent ever known such undying adoration from their child? Only King Lear from Goneril and Regan, perhaps. And most telling was the fact that the world was allowed to see it. Trump made sure it was one more chapter in his reality TV presidency. Not really Biden’s style. His first cabinet meeting on Thursday was relocated to the East Room because of coronavirus restrictions – the 16 permanent members wore face masks and sat in a giant square with empty chairs between them – but was otherwise a return to the staid old way of doing things. The main item on the agenda was not the American president’s sculpted handsomeness, nor his towering intellect, nor his indubitable virility, nor his ability to hit holes in one, but merely his freshly announced $2tn infrastructure plan. Flanked by the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, with the vice-president, Kamala Harris, opposite, Biden said he was asking five cabinet members to “take special responsibility to explain the plan to the American public”. He took no questions from the media and, after less than two and a half minutes, reporters were ushered out. “I thank the press for being here, but I’ll talk to you all later.” But even this brief glimpse behind the curtain spoke volumes about how much has changed. White men composed nearly three-quarters of Trump’s cabinet they make up only a third of Biden’s. On Thursday the East Room included Harris, the first woman and first woman of colour to service as vice-president Janet Yellen, the first woman to lead the treasury department Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay secretary confirmed to the cabinet and Deb Haaland, the first Native American in a president’s cabinet. “This is the first in American history that the cabinet looks like America,” Biden said. “That’s what we promised we were going to do, and we’ve done it.” If Trump represented a backlash against America’s first Black president, Biden’s cabinet represents a backlash against the backlash. Gaetz is being investigated over an alleged relationship with a 17-year-old child. My colleague Richard Luscombe reports:  Taylor died after police entered her home with a search warrant that did not require them to knock or announce themselves, and gunned her down after her boyfriend, startled by the forced entry, fired a warning shot toward the officers.  Several cities and states have sought to reform or ban no-knock warrants following Taylor’s killing. In Kentucky, the legislation – which is awaiting a signature from the state’s governor – limits but does not ban no-knock warrants. The bill would require officers to provide “clear and convincing evidence” that an alleged crime is violent, and assurances that not having a no-knock warrant would endanger lives in order to obtain the authority to break into a home unannounced. The measure would also ban no-knock warrants for searches conducted after 10pm and overnight.  Lawmakers did not pass a more restrictive bill that would have ended no-knock warrants. Attica Scott, a state lawmaker who introduced that bill called the legislation passed today that passed “an example of performative politics” that will fail to prevent what happened to Taylor from happening again. From the Chronicle:  Read more here. Biden will look at that legal authority, he’ll look at the policy issues around that, and then he’ll make a decision” on canceling debt, Klain told Politico. “He hasn’t made a decision on that, either way, in fact, he hasn’t yet gotten the memos that he needs to start to focus on that decision.” Democrats are increasingly pressuring Biden to address the student debt crisis using his executive authority. Lawmakers lack Republican support to easily pass debt cancellation measures via congress.   Biden has said he’d support canceling $10,000 in student debt for borrowers, but lawmakers, student advocates, civil rights organizations and consumer protection groups have pushed on the president to go further, and cancel up to $50,000 federal student loan debt.  As my colleague, Lauren Aratanni reported earlier this year:  The pandemic has left even more Americans unemployed and without the means to repay their student debt. The $2tn Cares Act, passed during the Trump administration, put a pause on payment requirements and waived interest for some student loans – and Biden extended those provisions. But for millions of Americans, unless Biden acts, repayment will have to resume after September this year. This new rise in cases is most pronounced in Michigan and New York but is becoming widespread across large swaths of the country. The threat of a fourth wave comes as many states have loosened Covid-19 restrictions – disregarding public health officials’ many warnings that doing so was premature. Dr Rochelle Walensky, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director, said Monday that a fourth wave is all but guaranteed, remarking: “I’m going to lose the script, and I’m going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom.” “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope. But right now I’m scared,” Walensky also said during an emotional moment of a White House briefing. Joe Biden has implored regional officials to keep or reinstate mask their mandates, because of the alarming trend in US case numbers. “I’m reiterating my call for every governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate,” the president said hours after Walensky’s comments. “Please, this is not politics. Reinstate the mandate if you let it down.” After Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell vowed to obstruct Biden’s infrastructure plan, Democrats signaled they’d pass it with or without Republican support. The Senate is split 50-50 between parties, with vice-president Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaking vote. Through a process called reconciliation, Democrats can pass budget-related measures with just 51 votes – circumventing the 60-vote threshold needed to pass most other major legislation in the Senate.  Romney, who has been somewhat more willing to vote with Democrats than his other Republican colleagues, has killed any hopes that Democrats could pass the ambitious infrastructure proposal with bipartisan support.  Here’s where the day stands so far: Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned.“The right to vote is fundamental in a democracy. American history is the story of expanding the right to vote to all citizens, and Black people, in particular, have had to march, struggle and even give their lives for more than a century to defend that right,” Cook said in a statement to Axios. “Apple believes that, thanks in part to the power of technology, it ought to be easier than ever for every eligible citizen to exercise their right to vote. We support efforts to ensure that our democracy’s future is more hopeful and inclusive than its past.” Cook’s statement is just the latest from companies who, after calls from voting rights activists, are starting to speak out against a law that restricts voting access in Georgia that was passed last week. The president opened the meeting by announcing that he has asked five members of his cabinet to take the lead on advancing his $2tn infrastructure package through Congress.  Those cabinet members are Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. After he made that announcement, reporters were escorted out of the East Room, so the rest of the cabinet meeting was conducted privately. A White House reporter spotted some senior officials leaving the meeting, and one of them said it “went well”. Courteney Ross said that Floyd had been clean for a while after she took him to hospital when he overdosed, but that he started using again about two weeks before his arrest by Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, last May. The bulk of Ross’s often tearful testimony on the fourth day of the trial focused on the pair’s opioid use, as the prosecution sought to head off defense claims that Floyd was killed by drugs because he had opioids and methamphetamine in his system. Seth Bravinder, a paramedic who treated Floyd at the scene of his arrest, testified that his ambulance was called to the scene for “someone with a mouth injury”. He said the call was a “code two” that suggested it was not a life-threatening emergency, which did not require lights and sirens. But less than two minutes later, the call was upgraded requiring a more urgent response. On arrival, he saw Chauvin and other police officers on top of Floyd. “I didn’t see any breathing or movement,” he said. Bravinder said his partner checked for a pulse, did not detect one and said he thought Floyd had suffered a cardiac arrest, a term he said is used for anyone whose heart has stopped. Bravinder said they tried to resuscitate Floyd but failed. The trial was shown police body-camera footage showing that Chauvin continued to kneel on Floyd’s neck even as the paramedics attempted to revive him. The police officer only removed it immediately before is lifted onto a stretcher and moved to the ambulance. “It’s really quite a remarkable and comprehensive plan,” the Democratic speaker said of the $2tn proposal. Pelosi noted that lawmakers have previously been able to work in a bipartisan fashion to advance infrastructure legislation. ”In the past, we had always been able to work in a bipartisan way, because it was about a four-letter word: jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs,” Pelosi said. But Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell has already said that he plans to fight Biden’s infrastructure plan “every step of the way”.“If in fact these allegations are true, of course being removed from the judiciary committee is the least that could be done,” the Democratic speaker said during her weekly press conference. Pelosi added, “From what we have heard so far, this would be a matter for the ethics committee.” The findings are the first to demonstrate that the vaccine remains effective for many months, an outcome that doctors and scientists had desperately hoped for because it suggests that people being vaccinated now should be protected at least until the autumn when boosters may be ready. Earlier today, the president joined the office of faith-based and neighborhood partnerships and the office of public engagement’s weekly faith and community engagement call. Biden told the more than 1,000 faith and community leaders on the call, “We need you to spread the word, let people in our communities and your community know how important is to get everyone vaccinated when it’s their turn, and soon they’ll just be able to just line up and just get their name on a list.” Psaki said she was not trying to “scare people” about coronavirus, but she emphasized that Americans needed to continue to be vigilant about limiting the spread of the virus. “We are still at war” with coronavirus, Psaki told reporters. The White House press briefing has now concluded.The White House press secretary described the attack as “yet another example of senseless gun violence” in America. In terms of ways to address that violence, Psaki noted Joe Biden continues to urge the Senate to pass the two background checks bills already approved by the House. Psaki also said the president is conducting an “ongoing review” of possible executive actions he could sign to help end gun violence.

Analysis of participants in the phase 3 trial, which has enrolled 46,307 people, identified 927 symptomatic Covid cases. Of these, 850 were in the placebo arm of the trial and 77 in the vaccine group. There were 32 cases of severe Covid, as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the placebo group, and none in the vaccinated group. More than 12,000 people vaccinated in the trial have now been followed for at least six months after their second dose. More striking still are results from the South African arm of the trial where nine Covid cases were observed among 800 participants. All of the cases were in the placebo group, and six were confirmed to be the new “variant of concern”, B.1.351, which has worried scientists because of its ability to partially evade antibodies produced in response to vaccines or past infection. Public Health England said on Wednesday that it knew of 469 confirmed or probable cases of the South African variant in the UK. With cases in the South African arm of the trial so low, more evidence is needed to confirm the vaccine’s protection against the new variant, but scientists were still delighted by the result. “I do regard this as a really positive indication,” said Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London. He said scientists had become “terribly worried” about the variant’s ability to evade immunity from previous infection or vaccination. “Studies like this confirm our sense that the vaccine gives such massive protective headroom that even with some loss of immunity, you’re still safe,” he said. The chairman of Pfizer, Albert Bourla, said the latest data put the company in a position to apply to the US Food and Drugs Administration for full approval of the vaccine. The jab is currently approved under emergency use authorisation. The findings, released in a preprint that has yet to be peer-reviewed, will boost confidence that the Pfizer vaccine can be highly effective against Covid even in the most vulnerable older people, who tend to generate far weaker immune responses to vaccines and natural infections. Pfizer trialled its vaccine with a three-week gap between shots, but the UK leaves a three-month gap, meaning it is unclear whether the same level of protection is achieved. The scientists went on to examine another branch of the immune defences raised by the vaccine, known as the T-cell response. Antibodies protect against infection by gumming up the virus and preventing it from infecting cells, but T-cells destroy human cells that are already infected, and may also support antibody production over time. After both shots of the vaccine, two-thirds of the participants had detectable T-cell responses. “We know that as people age their cellular immune responses are more difficult to elicit,” said Moss. “So that is something that we will need to keep an eye on very closely.” Further work at Public Health England’s Porton Down lab showed that blood serum taken from the volunteers after two shots of vaccine strongly neutralised the original coronavirus that spread around the world last year. But it was on average 14 times less effective against the P.1 variant first seen in Brazil, and which has now reached the UK and elsewhere. “The variant from Brazil reduces neutralisation response, but at this early stage after the vaccine where we’re seeing such high antibody levels we are still quietly confident that this should still provide valuable protection against this variant of concern,” said Parry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac132ab2cb6fadfcc73507e08d6a0980d83c988a/0_241_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=045a2c35e9bb7459c5f215e8e5d1e6ba","title":"fewer quarter covid symptoms request test uk study","story":"People in the UK must self-isolate for 10 days if they have Covid, with the period beginning from the onset of symptoms or, if there are no symptoms, from the day of a positive test result.  “Our data suggest that self-reported rates of full adherence to isolating and testing are low, as are rates of recognition of the main symptoms of Covid-19,” the researchers wrote, adding the findings suggested the effectiveness of the UK’s test, trace and isolate system was limited. The Corsair study includes responses from 53,880 participants across the UK, with about 2,000 participants in each of the 37 stages of the study conducted between 2 March 2020 and 27 January 2021. Some participants took part in more than one stage of the survey. The team said lower adherence to self-isolation was associated with factors including being a key worker, having children at home, being male, of a younger age, and experiencing greater financial hardship. Experts said the differences between the ONS and Corsair studies could have a number of explanations, including that the ONS study was based on responses of those within the test-and-trace system. “You can expect that the subset of people who have Covid and who also request a test and provide their details are more compliant than the overall population who have Covid,” said Prof Susan Michie, a co-author of the study who is a participant in the behavioural science subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts. By contrast, the Corsair study is based on sampling of the general population by an anonymous online market research company, something Michie said may also reduce concerns among respondents of saying they had broken the rules, compared with being phoned by the ONS, part of a government department. “The good news is that rates of adherence have been improving,” said James Rubin, an author on the paper and a professor of psychology of emerging health risks at King’s College London. But there is more work to be done, he said. “We need to get more people to engage with the system, to recognise the symptoms, to get a test, and then to self-isolate and follow it through,” Rubin said. “We need to be getting people into the mindset of as soon as you’ve got one of these symptoms coming on, get a test. Don’t leave it a few days. Don’t wait until it resolves. “What we don’t want is people who have got Covid out in the community, having contact with other people, spreading the infection. The more people with positive tests who self-isolate, the quicker we can get out of the restrictions we are currently in.”  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Since last May, NHS test and trace has contacted 3.2 million people who tested positive, and another 6.4 million of their contacts. Behind these numbers are countless lives saved and the latest ONS statistics show that when people are asked to self-isolate, the overwhelming majority do so. “It is vital that people continue to do their bit by isolating when they are asked to. As the prevalence of coronavirus falls, our testing-and-tracing system becomes more important in identifying and suppressing local outbreaks while also responding rapidly to the threat of new variants.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Variability of Irish weather continues to pose late blight risks"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4526741.1617316246!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"call for coombe master to resign as report finds doctor took vaccines home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Coombe: a former master of the hospital, Prof Chris Fitzpatrick, has called on Prof O’Connell to resign ‘in the interest of the hospital and in the public interest’. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe master of the Coombe in Dublin is facing pressure to resign after a review found that he allowed a consultant take leftover Covid-19 vaccines home to administer to family members. Lawyer Brian Kennedy SC, who was asked by the Coombe’s board to investigate how leftover doses were given to 16 family members of staff on the night of January 8th, found the doctor took the two doses home from the Coombe after a conversation with the master, Prof Michael O’Connell.Prof O’Connell told Mr Kennedy in his report published on Thursday that if the doctor was “comfortable to take the vaccine home”, then he was “not standing in their way”. The doctor said they believed the master gave his permission and would not have taken them home otherwise.Mr Kennedy said in his report that the doctor chose to take the remaining vaccine home and to administer it to two family members after 10pm when there was no one left to vaccinate at the hospital and there was still some vaccine in the diluted vial which the medic had been using.The doctor is identified in the report only as “Consultant B” but is understood to be Dr Carmen Regan, an obstetrician at the hospital and the wife of former Coombe master Sean Daly. Dr Regan did not respond to contacts seeking comment. ‘Very clear’ guidelinesHSE chief clinical officer Colm Henry told a briefing on Thursday that the health guidelines were “very clear” in that vaccines should be given at vaccination sites such as hospitals. Another former master of the hospital, Prof Chris Fitzpatrick, called on Prof O’Connell to resign “in the interest of the hospital and in the public interest”.He told The  the controversy had damaged the reputation of the hospital and undermined the national vaccination programme, and that Prof O’Connell played “a central role” in the events detailed in the independent report and “therefore must be held ultimately accountable”.“What happened should never have happened. It has caused considerable upset both inside the hospital and outside, and will cause more upset now that the independent report has been made public and more information disclosed,” said Prof Fitzpatrick.A spokesman for Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said he was reviewing the report. Labour leader Alan Kelly said the board of the hospital needed to make clear if it had confidence in the master. A spokeswoman for the board said it was not commenting on whether it had or not.

who had been carrying out vaccinations at the hospital - was bringing doses home to administer to the consultant’s family.The board of the Coombe asked Brian Kennedy SC to carry out an independent review of the decision by the hospital’s master Prof Michael O’Connell to 16 family members of staff.As first reported in The  in January, the initial doses were given to relatives late on Friday, January 8th after Prof O’Connell said doses were left over following vaccinations at the hospital.The report found that 16 vaccines were administered to one or more family members of eight staff.The family members vaccinated included two of Prof O’Connell’s children.Mr Kennedy said that the decision to vaccinate family members “emerged from a relatively short and information conversation” between 11 iniduals before or around 9pm that night.“No one who was present indicated any disagreement, nor have any of those present suggested that they were coerced or pressurised into the decision,” he concluded.“In that sense, the decision can be characterised as a consensus decision.”The report concludes that Prof O’Connell “expressed some form of agreement” and several of those present “considered that to be a matter of significance” that a decision had to come from the master or more generally from a person in senior management or a position of authority”.His report said a doctor, only identified in the report as “Consultant B”, took two vaccine doses home and administered them to two family members after a conversation at the hospital with “Consultant C” - who is Prof O’Connell.Training videoMr Kennedy asked Consultant B about an online training video for vaccinators which state that “diluted vaccine should not be transported for administration in another location”.“When asked about this, Consultant B stated that while they watched the relevant online video, they did not recall the reference to the transportability of the vaccine and did not give it any consideration on Friday evening,” he said.The report said Consultant B did not recall any discussion about the “transportability” of the vaccine on the evening.The doctor lives relatively close to the hospital and “understood that the vaccine would still be effect if it were transported by car over a relatively short distance,” the report states.Mr Kennedy said that given Consultant B’s training and knowledge of their family members’ medical history, they were confident that they could manage the administration of the vaccine to them at home.Medical studentsThe report also finds that there was “no standby list” of others to be vaccinated in the event of leftover doses but there was no guidance at the time which suggested a requirement for a list.There was also “no consideration or discussion” on the evening of the excess vaccines that there was the possibility of vaccinating medical students, Mr Kennedy said.The hospital and in particular Prof O’Connell were not aware that medical students from a university, understood to be Trinity College Dublin, had been told be on standby, the report finds.Mr Kennedy said that there was a conversation amongst a group of 11 consultants, medics and hospital staff, including Prof O’Connell who met in the vaccination area on the night of January 8th to decide what to do with the leftover doses.The lawyer found that there was no discussion about the possibility of attempting to identify frontline healthcare workers from other hospitals who had not been vaccinated and asking them to come to the hospital to be vaccinated.The master later told Mr Kennedy in an interview that he “gave thought at the time to the possibility of seeking to get candidates from the nearest Garda station or fire station”, though he did not state it to the group at the time.The master indicated that the group was concerned about consent procedures, a lack of knowledge of medical history and whether medical legal cover would be available.The report found that it was not possible to establish whose idea it was to vaccinate family members but “it may be that the first reference was by one inidual to the fact that another inidual had an elderly family member or members living relatively nearby”.In a statement, the board of the hospital accepted that “mistakes were made, not least in the decision to vaccinate family members and, in one case, in the administration of two vaccines offsite. Lessons must and will be learnt to ensure that similar issues cannot recur.”‘Key actions’Mary Donovan, chairwoman of the hospital, said the board was “disappointed” that the family members were vaccinated with leftover vaccines.“This should not have happened. We are also concerned that in the case of one family, two vaccinations occurred offsite. Again this should not have happened.”She said that the board “takes what occurred extremely seriously and has started a process to address the implications”.The hospital said that “key actions and measures are being implemented to ensure that such an incident could not occur again and hospital guidelines and protocols will be enhanced.”Ms Donovan said that the hospital has shared Mr Kennedy’s report with the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, the HSE and the Medical Council.Mr Donnelly, HSE chief executive Paul Reid and other figures in politics and healthcare criticised the decision to vaccinate the family members at a time when only frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable residents in nursing homes had priority for vaccines.In late January Mr Donnelly sought a full account of what happened with the vaccine rollout at the Coombe from the chairman of the hospital’s board, saying that: “Trust in the vaccine programme is of critical importance and what happened should not have happened.”Prof O’Connell apologised and said that he made “every effort to prioritise and identify additional frontline workers” for the vaccines on the evening of January 8th but they could not find more so the decision was made to vaccinate family members to avoid doses going to waste.Prof Deirdre Murphy, head of the department of obstetrics at Trinity College Dublin and a consultant at the Coombe, later told Mr Kennedy as part of his review that almost 40 medical students were overlooked for vaccines on the night they were given to the family members.Prof Murphy said that the master told her two days after the family members were vaccinated that the hospital was “not in a position” to vaccinate the students.The HSE has advised that medical students should be vaccinated alongside other health staff during their placements in hospital. Prof Murphy said that at the time of the vaccinations some of the students were working overnight on the labour ward in the Coombe.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 228,988 had received their second dose.Some 185,432 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 327,851 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 281,109 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp24,962 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 500 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4526647.1617301523!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vaccinated o rourke eager for a tight hug from grandchildren","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary O’Rourke, former Fianna Fáil government minister, at her home in Athlone after getting her second Covid-19 vaccination. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe former minister said she had hoped her second shot being scheduled on April Fool’s Day was “not a big fat joke” but it wasn’t: she got the vaccine at her doctor’s surgery in Athlone on Thursday.Now fully vaccinated, she longs for closer contact with her six grandchildren, once the vaccine takes effect.“My son Aengus is my care-giver in my social bubble, dropping in food and newspapers to me but the children don’t come in,” she tells The . “They stay in the garden sometimes and wave in and blow kisses at me. This is part of life but it is horrible. I want a tight hug – a tight, tight hug – which they will give me, I know.”At 83 years of age, O’Rourke falls into the over-70s age group currently being vaccinated.One humorous consequence of the vaccine rollout has been people discovering the ages of friends and neighbours, which some may have preferred not to disclose, she says.“It was just kind of fun. I never mind telling my age. Why should I? Most people in Athlone would know the age I am. I think some people are a little bit precious about their age,” she says.O’Rourke lives alone and says reading and watching rugby on television have sustained her through the monotony of lockdowns.“It is the never ending, day by day by day. Things don’t change,” she says. “I won’t go out. I am quite terrified. I feel that the only safe place for me is here in my own home.” She has also used the pandemic to catch up with old friends, inside and outside of politics, by digging phone numbers out of her old diaries and just calling people “out of the blue”.“The stories I have unearthed – I am getting it all. I find the telephone powerful,” she says.Politcal ‘anorak’The former Seanad leader still follows politics closely, declaring herself “an anorak” about it.She thinks Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar are “settling into a groove” but believes Varadkar “has his own flank to watch now with all the business of the leak and that”. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan is “the quiet one”, she says, but now that he has his climate Bill “he is happy with that and he is musing about that”.O’Rourke thinks the Government “are, in the main, managing”, but she wonders about the eventual fallout from the cost of the pandemic and the vast sums of State support being paid out.“An end has to come to the money that is going out. It is billions and billions. It is all very cheap money but eventually it will have to stop and be paid back,” she says. To “anti-vaxxers” and people reluctant to follow her lead and get the vaccine, she says: “Don’t be silly. How could you not trust something that is going to do so much good worldwide?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4525509.1617228405!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"all employees set to have right to disconnect from work from today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Tánaiste Leo Varadkar is also to invite submissions on his plans to put the right of employees to seek remote working into law.

It says “any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question”.Mr Varadkar said: “The code of practice comes into effect immediately and applies to all types of employment, whether you are working remotely or not.

Garden centres and plant nurseries are now allowed to provide a click-and-collect service, and golf courses also reopened.Strict lockdown measures have been in force in Northern Ireland since St Stephen’s Day in order to limit the spread of coronavirus.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsSolidarity with The Silenced.Justice for the Cabra Road One.The Sinn Féin leader was “Brollied” in the Dáil on Wednesday and her colleagues were disgusted.Cut off in full flow for the second time in a row by the Phantom Microphone Muffler of the Lower House. Her ordeal mirrored the treatment meted out to Joe Brolly on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live show a couple of weeks ago when the outspoken GAA pundit was cancelled mid-interview because of remarks he made about the DUP.A few days later and Mary Lou was similarly disconnected, mid-sentence, from the Convention Centre’s PA system. In her case it wasn’t a content issue but rather because she was banging on for too long.But she let it pass, as did her supporters, which was surprising.Fast forward to this week’s Leaders’ Questions and the Dublin Central TD is silenced yet again as she engages with the Taoiseach.An outrageous thing to do.Or maybe an outrageously brave thing to do.It’s a plucky man or woman who decides to mute the formidable Sinn Féin leader when she’s up on her feet and holding forth. It goes against the commonly held belief that it is humanly impossible for anyone to stop Mary Lou from making her point if that is what she wants to do. Furthermore, a person or persons responsible for turning off her mic risk incurring the wrath of her ardent supporters, who take a very dim view of people slighting their leader.The latest outrage happened when the Ceann Comhairle indicated that her speaking time had expired. She had been questioning Micheál Martin on the Department of Health’s practice of gathering information on children with autism who are involved in legal actions against the State.TDs routinely ignore the first intervention. Deputy McDonald ploughed on. So Seán Ó Fearghail called time again. Leaders routinely ignore the second intervention.“Time is up deputy, please” insisted the Chair. Mary Lou kept on talking but there was no sound, so she had to admit defeat. “Thank you for shutting off my microphone” she sniffed, reluctantly resuming her seat.“I didn’t turn off your microphone, or anyone else’s,” shrugged the Ceann Comhairle.The Taoiseach responded. He too ran over. Ó Fearghail harried him, but Micheál Martin was also impervious to his pleadings. Once, twice, three times he was told to finish up, but to no avail.Sinn Féin’s Padraig Mac Lochlainn was seething at the injustice of the situation. He interrupted with a point of order. How come the Taoiseach is allowed speak for “about 30 or 40 seconds” over time when his party leader (and other speakers) are unceremoniously silenced “for the second week in a row?”Micheál was still talking as the Ceann Comhairle was barking at Sinn Féin’s Whip to sit down and mind his own business and Mac Lochlainn was noisily insisting on urgent clarification from the Chair.“Why are microphones being turned off when the Taoiseach’s microphone remains on? Why are microphones being turned off?”The Ceann Comhairle urged him not to bring the House into “disrepute” but Padraig had the bit between his teeth.“I asked WHO turned off the microphones?”Ó’Feargháil, who likes to keep an orderly house, resembled a tortured barman calling time over and over again, imprisoned for all eternity in a disorderly closing-time loop.He leapt to his feet, growing more annoyed by the second.“I’ll tell you what, in more than five years occupying this chair, I have never turned off anybody’s microphone” he bellowed, jowls a quiver. “I have asked people to abide by the time limits, which are generally ignored. Will you not ignore me and please resume your seat. You’re out of order. YOU’RE OUT OF ORDER!”Padraig relented. “Fair enough,” sez he. “Will whoever is turning off the microphones please stop doing it?”There has to be a better way to enforce good time keeping. Ushers using long shepherd’s crooks or Vaudeville hooks to yank long-winded TDs off the stage would be entertaining.Or maybe the Ceann Comhairle’s first warning could trigger a Dáil “Countdown Clock” with windbag TDs disappearing through the floor to the countdown sound of “du-du du-du de-de-de-de Boom!”Moving onBut with no useful props, all Sean Ó Feargháil could do was declare the debate at an end and plot a course for calmer waters. “We are moving on to Deputy Kelly.”That would be Labour leader Alan Kelly, normally expected at this point in the proceedings to be clutching a grenade and pulling the pin out with his teeth.But the pandemic has turned him disgracefully co-operative and mellow.He began by wishing the Taoiseach well with his new Covid strategy. “The country needs you to deliver and we will play a constructive role in whatever way we can and we will criticise where necessary …. I hope and pray that you deliver.”But a good outcome depends on Micheál getting the plan right because “you’ve put all your eggs in the basket of the vaccine basket”. As you do.Alan Kelly was anxious to dig into the Government’s data for a large number of reasons, one of which is very close to his heart.“My wedding anniversary is in July,” he announced, all of a sudden.“I’m going to offer to take my wife out for dinner in a restaurant she chooses,” he proudly puffed. What a guy. Imagine that, he’s even letting her pick the establishment. The missus will be thrilled.“But I don’t know if I’m actually going to be able to take her out in July to a restaurant because I don’t know if they’ll be open.”The Taoiseach struggled to keep a straight face.Lucky Mrs K. Counting down the days, now that Himself has let the cat out of the bag.Either that or when AK47 makes his big “offer” she’ll shoot him straight down for coming out with such schmaltzy twaddle in the Dáil.Even though the Ceann Comhairle called time on Kelly a number of times the phantom microphone muffler left his microphone unmolested. The Taoiseach wasn’t so lucky.In what is a very rare occurrence in the Dáil, the final words of Micheál’s detailed reply on the vaccination plan went unheard as he was also “Brollied” by the unseen hand at the audio desk.He didn’t appear too put out, even though taoisigh are usually given more latitude because of their lofty status.A comforting thought for Mary Lou. There will be no cutting off of the Sinn Féin leader’s microphone when she becomes taoiseach. Opposition rivals might not be so blessed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4523374.1617053574!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit focus should be on building relationships not border poll says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told Senators Government could get Northern Ireland protocol ‘back on an even keel’. File photograph: Alan Betson Northern Ireland institutions are “just about hanging on” after a “bruising number of years” and the focus must be on building relationships rather than on a border poll, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney also told the Seanad that “we can move away from threats of legal action” after the UK’s unilateral move to extend the grace period for post-Brexit checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain until October 1st.During a debate on Brexit he told Senators,“we can get back to partnership through a specialised committee and joint committee” and can get the Northern Ireland protocol “back on an even keel”.He also said it was an opportunity for “more pragmatism and flexibility from the European Commission as well”.The Minister admitted that “I’ve become some sort of a bogey man” over the protocol but “the irony is” that his office more than any other “has been constantly talking to the European Commission about need to for pragmatism and compromise”.In an impassioned contribution he said the narrative “now is that it is being foisted on Northern Ireland by the EU and Irish Government and it’s not”.The protocol “was designed as much in London as it was in Brussels, which people seem to conveniently forget”, he pointed out.It is a solution “that isn’t perfect but is certainly the best way of mitigating the disruption on the island of Ireland”.He warned that a collapse in the protocol would result in two “very unpalatable choices” for Ireland.To protect Ireland’s place in the EU market, the State would have to put some kind of border infrastructure in place, which would be politically impossible “or we would be taken out of the EU market by default”.United IrelandSpeaking about calls for a border poll on a united Ireland, Mr Coveney said the focus had to be on building relationships first because the Northern Ireland institutions are not functioning as they should. They are “just about hanging on” after a “bruising number of years”.He said that “perhaps the most challenging element of Brexit” was in how to rebuild relationships “that have undoubtedly been damaged.“Good things happen in Northern Ireland when the British and Irish governments work together,” he added.Earlier Fianna Fáil Senator Niall Blaney said there is no border in the Irish Sea and “we should knock that every chance we get”. He said “it is an imaginary border”.The Donegal Senator said unionists are in an awkward position and “we don’t need to do anything that ramps that up but rather the opposite”.He said those calling for a North-South poll needed to be reminded “of how the Good Friday Agreement was won”.He said a similar sentiment is needed now “this country coming together as one isn’t necessarily about territory but is more about people”.He said of Fianna Fáil’s relationship with Sinn Féin that “we sometimes rub each other up the wrong way” but everyone had work to do for a border poll “down the road” and Sinn Féin needed to put more emphasis on building relationships with unionists.

Photograph: AP PhotoMarkus Schreiber The meeting had dragged on almost three hours, oxygen levels were reaching a critical point and I was losing the will to live.It was 2009, and my Irish Famine genes had commanded me to buy property, so I found myself trapped in a room with a so-called Baugruppe of 50 Germans. We were planning a co-operative to buy and convert into apartments an old Berlin hospital complex.Though we were still in an early phase of planning, the scale of the project and our lack of experience meant I had one priority from the meeting: cost control. Rather than discuss quantity surveyors, however, this self-managing group of amateurs launched into a detailed discussion of swings.Should swings be allowed near the buildings or restricted to the common area? What kind of swings: wooden frame or metal? Who would pay for their upkeep and the annual inspection from Germany’s – no joke – playground police?I departed the project shortly after and watched as a fascinated observer the rows, tears and bankruptcies over a doubling of costs, for which no one was responsible.A year into the Covid-19 pandemic, with Germans humbled by their stumbled vaccination start, I’ve been thinking again about that airless room 12 years ago and the obsession with small details while ignoring the bigger picture.Once upon a time Germany prided itself on “Vorsprung durch Technik” – being ahead through engineering. These days, it’s behind on vaccination, playing sullen midfield in the EU’s already underperforming vaccination team.Nails in the coffinEach day the newspapers are full of further nails in the coffin of German efficiency. The latest: after weeks of struggling to operate vaccination centres, Germany’s federal health minister Jens Spahn announced this week a revolutionary idea to speed up jabs – get doctors to administer them, starting after Easter.When I checked with my doctor on Wednesday, he said that piles of forms had arrived for this process – eight pages per patient – but, as yet, no vaccine.“You know why we’ll never have a German Covid variant?” he asked wearily. “Because efforts to register it with the authorities are doomed to failure.”Every country has its own Covid dramas, a reflection of a fast-moving crisis but the decisions taken – and their effects – offer telling insights into the people in question.German cultural obsession with the detail rather than outcome is visible everywhere, from coffee shops to government departments. Plait this together with strict hierarchies and zero feedback loops from low to high, and you have a bureaucratic blueprint of Germany’s vaccination vexation.This country’s bureaucratic model was developed in the 19th century under Otto von Bismarck and was adopted across Europe because it had – and still has – a solid reputation for delivering independent, thorough and legally sound results. But the Covid crisis has exposed its two weaknesses: this model is not fast and it is risk averse.Where Ireland fumes over private school staff getting unused vaccines, Germans are furious that some vaccination centre personnel chose to throw away shots rather than vaccinate someone, anyone, out of order.For Prof Frank Ulrich Montgomery, the Berlin-based head of the World Medical Association, such disposal of vaccines is a collision of a deep-seated German cultural need for equity and accountability with a system that punishes initiative, pragmatism and risk-taking.“A scarce vaccine has to be distributed fairly and strong prioritisation rules have to be observed this leads to tremendous bureaucracy,” he said. “Sometimes the observance of rules becomes more important than a quick and easy solution of evident problems.”Many-headed hydraIn the first pandemic wave, Germany’s decentralised, federal system was a boon, allowing local health systems, experts and hospitals make swift, far-sighted interventions.Now the same federal system is proving a many-headed hydra, strangling itself as it tries to manage newly created vaccination centres, irregular vaccine distribution, online vaccine registrations and a lockdown-weary population.Instead of by local experts, the third wave is being overseen by politicians, many facing re-election in six months, who have no experience in pandemic management.One senior Berlin doctor tells me the politicians’ hands-on approach is a far cry from the 2015 refugee crisis, when the government quickly farmed out logistics to the Red Cross and the army.“The refugees was like the Aids crisis, politicians didn’t want to touch it because they saw no gain,” said the doctor. “Today, vaccinations and protecting the population has a positive connotation. The politicians won’t let go, taking the kudos if it goes right but refusing responsibility if it goes wrong.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4526669.1617306929!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vaccine rollout in europe unacceptably slow says who","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCovid-19 vaccination centre at the Palais des Sports in Lyon: France set a record last week of 400,000 doses given in a single day. Photograph:  Jean-Philippe KsiazekAFP The rollout of vaccines in Europe is “unacceptably slow” and countries must reduce any barriers standing in the way of administering more jabs, the World Health Organisation has said.It comes as a fresh wave of infection takes hold in the continent and a string of countries tighten restrictions in a bid to curb infection.“Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic. Not only do they work, they are also highly effective in preventing infection. However, the rollout of these vaccines is unacceptably slow,” the WHO’s regional director Hans Kluge said in a statement.“And as long as coverage remains low, we need to apply the same public health and social measures as we have in the past, to compensate for delayed schedules.”He urged countries to ramp up manufacturing, reduce barriers to vaccination, and use “every single vial we have in stock, now”.Vaccine deliveries to the European Union are set to increase this month, as production capacity expands and the first deliveries of the single-shot Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine arrive on April 19th.However, national rollouts across the bloc are a mixed picture, with some countries struggling to scale up the rate at which they administer doses.France set a record last week of 400,000 doses given in a single day, a rate slightly higher than Ireland’s record daily rate of 27,427 doses as a proportion of the population.AstraZeneca delayBut some national rollouts were slowed by the temporary suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine and decisions to limit its use to certain age groups, which the European Medicines Agency has said are not supported by the available scientific evidence.There is widespread frustration in Germany at the slow pace of the rollout, which saw an average of 277,741 people vaccinated each day last week, the population equivalent of about 15,700 in Ireland, with criticisms of ill-functioning booking systems and excessive red tape.In Madrid, the regional authority shut vaccination centres for four days to give staff Easter holidays, ignoring a plea from the national government to keep them open.Meanwhile in the Netherlands, regional health board chief André Rouvoet suggested opening up vaccination beyond the current priority groups of people aged 60-64, or with obesity or Down Syndrome, after 135,000 doses were not used last week because too few people made appointments.“We should be using the available vaccines as soon as we can,” Mr Rouvoet told local media. “Nobody benefits from vaccines being left unnecessarily on the shelf.”Stark inequalityAcross the continent there is stark inequality in the number of vaccines that have been administered. The United Kingdom, Malta, Serbia and Hungary have given out more than 30 jabs per 100 people, while in Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine the rate is in the low single digits. The EU average is roughly 17 jabs per 100, similar to Ireland’s rate.Mr Kluge, of the WHO, appealed to governments to share doses with countries that need them more once health workers and the vulnerable had been vaccinated, while urging caution on relaxing public health measures.“My message to governments in the region is therefore that now is not the time to relax measures,” he said. “We can’t afford not to heed the danger. We have all made sacrifices, but we cannot let exhaustion win. We must keep reining in the virus.”In April, May and June, the EU is expecting over three times the amount of vaccine doses to be delivered than have arrived in total to date. It has hardened export controls, and internal markets commissioner Thierry Breton has suggested that Britain should not expect to receive any AstraZeneca doses made in the EU until the company delivers its missed commitments to the bloc.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view brazil s health and democracy are both on the brink","story":"Brazil\u0027s Covid-19 case numbers and deaths have hit staggering new highs in the past month: over 60,000 died in March alone.

Jewish people will understand the resonance of the symbols and practices in very different ways from Christians.It went on to encourage families to gather at the table with a bowl of warm water, flatbread, honey and a sprig of rosemary, and for the youngest to ask questions to their elders about the tradition.  Critics said the guide appears to be appropriating liturgy from the Jewish faith and portrays striking similarities to the Jewish Seder meal.A Facebook event was also promoted by the Church on Wednesday with a screenshot from a video – which was never published – showing a family appearing to take part in a Christian-style Seder. Members of the clergy have claimed the guidance is inappropriate and taps into ... centuries of anti-Semitism on the part of Christians.Nick Nawrockyi, Rural Dean of Grimsby and Cleethorpes, told The  it was clear from the screenshot that there were little elements of trying to replicate a Jewish Seder meal. He said: It\u0027s not appropriate because it\u0027s appropriating a liturgy, a ritual rite from another faith, that we don\u0027t need to be doing. It\u0027s insensitive and it taps into ... and I don\u0027t think this was the intention, but it taps into centuries of anti-Semitism on the part of Christians.Dr Jo Kershaw, parish priest of St Anne\u0027s Wrenthorpe in Wakefield, tweeted: It is wrong (and harmful) to steal Jewish ritual. We have our own. They may say this isn\u0027t a Christian Seder, but the duck test (if it walks and quacks like a duck....) applies, and that sure as heck isn\u0027t what a normal Anglican Eucharist looks like.But Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, former senior Rabbi to Reform Judaism, said she did not find the guidance offensive, adding: If they wanted to take Jewish liturgy out of Christianity, it is like taking the soul of Christianity. Easter is completely linked to Passover, which is why it changes date every year, and to deny the Jewishness of Jesus and of Christianity may indicate a discomfort with Judaism and not with Christianity. The Church of England has since withdrawn the guidance and apologised for any offence caused.Revd Dr Richard Sudworth, its national inter-religious affairs adviser, said: The Maundy Thursday video and text has been withdrawn because of the perceived association of the readings and actions with a Jewish seder meal.The brief prayers and actions are not, and were not intended to be a Christianised Seder, as the text pointed out. Nor was this intended to replace the celebration of face-to-face Eucharist, that we long for so much. Rather, this was an offering to families to be able to pray and interact, across the generations.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day apocalyptic lightning italian dolomites","story":"A rare upward lightning strike shoots into the sky in the Italian Dolomites, this picture is a finalist in the Storm Photos of the Year competitionBernard GeraghtyStorm Photos of the YearCover-ImagesMark Rutte: Dutch prime minister survives vote of no confidenceCovid lockdown roadmap: the key dates for when restrictions will end and what rules will changeEaster lockdown rules: what you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions start easingUK regulator identifies 30 cases of blood clot events after use of AstraZeneca Covid vaccine Olympic kayaker Nathan Baggaley facing jail after smuggling £110m haul of cocaineShakespeare can help doctors improve bedside mannerDerek Chauvin trial: Officer should not have knelt on George Floyd\u0026#39s neck after he stopped resisting, supervisor saysAlex Salmond demands TV showdown with Nicola Sturgeon before May electionsExclusive: Jockey Club faces claims of ‘racism, sexism and bullying’Body matching description of missing Philip Mawer found in Mozambique after terror attackComment: Keir Starmer is acting like a Tory superfan, robbing Britain of a real OppositionInside the vaccine factory tug of war: UK puts up millions, EU says \u0026#39non\u0026#39 to exportsWatch given to Chinese troops at Tiananmen Square pulled by auctioneers after threatsExclusive: Covid passport trials to begin at UK events within weeksBritish taxpayers funded EU factory at heart of vaccine rowFailed asylum seeker guilty of murdering woman above kebab shopWheelchair-bound man and young children among latest wave of cross-Channel migrantsBoom in damages payouts as RAF jets smash the sound barrierComment: Can fair minded people really cast their votes for Salmond\u0026#39s gang of thirty-two?Church of England Easter meal advice leaves bad taste after claims it \u0026#39appropriated\u0026#39 Jewish SederBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two toddlers dropped 14 feet border fence new mexico desert","story":"People smugglers dropped two Ecuadorian sisters,  aged three and five, over a 14ft border fence into the New Mexico desert.The horrifying incident, caught on video, was condemned as appalling and vicious by Border Control officials.Footage shows the smugglers straddling the fence and lifting the toddlers over the fence, dropping them several feet to the ground, before running away without even bothering to check that the children were no injured by the fall.The operation was watched by border agents at a control centre who rescued the toddlers.Miraculously the children, who were taken to hospital for evaluation, were not hurt.El Paso Sector Chief Patrol Agent Gloria Chavez, who posted the footage condemned the smugglers.I\u0027m appalled by the way these smugglers viciously dropped innocent children from a 14-foot border barrier last night.If not for the vigilance of our agents using mobile technology. these two tender-aged siblings would have been exposed to the harsh elements of desert environment for hours.Elsewhere a four-year-old Honduran boy was picked up by the Mexican authorities after he was caught walking towards the border on his own.Last month a nine-year-old girl drowned while trying to cross the Rio Grande.The incidents come against a backdrop of a surge in the number of unaccompanied children arriving at the US-Mexico border since Joe Biden took office.Another 300 agents are being deployed to the region to handle the influx of migrants.Border officials are struggling to cope with the numbers.

Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, believes the move may help “keep things ing” and prevent future lockdowns. Covid rates among  to -year-olds in England have risen to their highest level for nearly two months. They now stand a . cases per ,, up from . the previous week. Ministers are awaiting safety data on the AstraZeneca vaccine before making a decision on whether children could be vaccinated. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Prof Finn, speaking in a personal capacity, said: “Since more than % of the UK population are aged under , you simply can’t get above % coverageyou don’t immunise any children.” Senior scientists are expecting another wave of virus at some point, mainly among the unvaccinated but including those for whom the vaccines do not work perfectly. Older children are considered most likely to fuel new outbreaks. On current trends, most of the  million school-age children could be vaccinated before the autumn term. However a decision may be delayed until regulators see how rapidly cases are rising as we go in to winter.

Cambridge University’s Biostatistics Unit estimates the R number for England – the rate at which the virus spreading – is now just above one. Wales is set to become the first home nation to offer vaccine to all over s and to younger vulnerable people. First Minister Mark Drakeford said “This truly remarkable effort is down to the hard work of thousands working tirelessly on the front line.” Why all our kids may need to have the jab - Comment, by Professor Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at Bristol University One of the very few good things about Covid is that it rarely affects children seriously. Many other infections do, which helps explain why most vaccinations happen in childhood.  But Covid’s main target is adults, especially older ones, who are at much higher risk of hospital-isation and death. On the other hand, most vaccines don’t just protect those who receive them but also safeguard others by driving down circulation of the infection. It’s becoming increasingly clear that Covid vaccines can do this too. But to have this effect it’s important that a big enough proportion of the population receives vaccine and has a good level of immunity as a result. Since more than % of our population is under , you simply can’t get above % coverageyou don’t immunise any children.

In a speech to the NASUWT annual conference, new President Phil Kemp will say “the snouts have to come out of the trough” and demand action to protect public cash from the “Wild West” system. Mr Kemp, a teacher in North Tyneside, will accuse some private companies and iniduals of lining their pockets while other teachers scrimp to get adequate kit for their pupils. He was expected to say: “The salaries being paid to iniduals in some of these academy trusts is not just eye-watering, it’s verging on criminality in my view. “So many salaries, paid for from the public purse, rising over the £, mark, and some well-publicised, almost reaching half a million pounds. “The national pay scale for all those in education for teachers and all school leaders needs to be re-introduced as soon as possible and measures put in place to ensure all employers in education adhere to it. “The snouts have to come out of the trough and the public purse protected from those who will take advantage of the increasing deregulation of our education system.” Academies receive funding from the Government but they are run by academy trusts, which gives them more control over things like the curriculum and term dates. Mr Kemp will demand adequate funding for all schools, saying: “funding where it’s not paper or glue-sticks, it’s both”. “Value for money is, of course, vital,” he will add.

It comes after Unlock Democracy asked the ICO whether ... the Government has provided any justication for this proposed exemption. The ICO replied that it held no information.

Father-of-four Jonathan Bailey, known to his devastated pals as aposBazapos or aposBazzaapos, had posted on social media that he was going to take his own le. As he began live-streaming video of his actions on Facebook, his horried friends made a series of  calls. According to Stoke on Trent Live, an inquest into his death heard police were too late to save Mr Bailey. The hearing was told officers had two dferent addresses for Mr Bailey as he had moved just the week before, and they dispatched patrols to both locations within minutes. But by the time the -year-old was found, he couldn’t be revived. He was pronounced dead at his flat in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire on July  last year. The popular gym owner, who was known for his charitable and voluntary work, had struggled with mental health issues since his twenties. He had been diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder of an impulsive type. In the week leading up to his death, Mr Bailey’s mental state signicantly deteriorated. He had cut his wrists and also threatened to jump off a roof. Friend Craig Spillane, who runs the mental health group Men Unite, said: “He was clearly in a dark place.” He described him as ‘an all-round good bloke’ and had been trying to help him tackle his problems. Mr Spillane was at home on July  when his stepdaughter alerted him to an alarming Facebook post, where Mr Bailey said he was ‘going to kill himself’. “I rang . I knew I needed to get straight to his flat,” Mr Spillane said in a statement. “As I was driving, my stepdaughter shouted ‘oh my God, he’s doing it live on Facebook’.” Mr Spillane reached the block of flats and managed to get inside the building. Best friend Stefan Hanks said: “He could barely stand. He was shaking and cold.”  Harplands Hospital staff felt his physical health needed to be sorted before he could receive a mental health assessment, so he was advised to attend AE. Two consultant psychiatrists and another mental health expert carried out the assessment several hours later. Dawn Burston, from North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare, said he was deemed to be ‘high risk’, although he said he had no suicidal thoughts. “The team advised that he would benefit from an admission to Harplands Hospital to support him through this crisis period,” she told the inquest. “Mr Bailey, however, declined that admission.” “I ran up and noticed the door was unlocked slightly, but with a chain. I just shoulder-barged the door, breaking the chain.” He found Mr Bailey hanging and tried to get him down. Police officers then arrived and began CPR while paramedics were on their way. The inquest was told that just the day before his death, concerned friends had spotted Mr Bailey in the street and had taken him to Harplands Hospital. He had taken diazepam. The doctors tried three times to persuade him to change his mind.  At the inquest, family and friends questioned why medics hadn’t sectioned him under the Mental Health Act. Ms Burston, who investigated the case following the death, said they didn’t have powers to detain him as he was deemed to have the capacity to make his own decisions. Mr Hanks and another friend took him home that evening and he seemed to be a bit better.

Scenes of massive crowds at Hyde Park in Leeds and hundreds who gathered at a rule-breaking meet-up in Manchester city centre were among the rule flouters this week, as some blatantly ignored the rule-of-six restrictions. Police cracked down in Nottingham after a boozy brawl broke out as hundreds of students gathered in the Arboretum Recreation Ground.How do you think the lockdown easing is going  Share your thoughts in the comments below...Authorities said they would beginning seizing alcohol from people entering parks from Tuesday this week following the fracas as footage emerged online of people ignoring social distancing rules. Images of parks around England strewn with litter and empty cans and bottles following the first days of lockdown easing caused widespread dismay. There has been no suggestion from the Government of a fourth lockdown, as the vaccination rollout continues to dramatically drive down daily deaths and case numbers.  But experts have warnedpeople mingle too closely over Easter weekend the virus could begin spreading rapidly again. Indoor mixing between households remains banned under Englandaposs lockdown rules. The warning comes as Europe grapples with a third wave of the virus, which this week saw France plunged into yet another lockdown. Europeaposs vaccination programme has lagged behind Britainaposs. And official data this week confirmed roughly half of the UK population now has Covid antibodies.  But young adults yearning for freedom from Covid rules are being warned to stay vigilant as they face a delay in the vaccination queue, after a bumper start to the rollout that saw the jabs effort pass million first doses is set for a slowdown.Professor Lawrence Young told the Sun Online people should not grow complacent about the risks of mingling outdoors as he urged people to follow distancing rules when they met with pals. He said: The virus is still out there and very infectious. While the risk of transmission is low in outdoor spaces, crowding together could result in some spread of the virus and it’s too easy to take liberties which we consider to be low risk but aren’t e.g. close contact by hugging or popping inside to go to somebody ’s toilet. We need to hang on in there with the current restrictions for a bit longer – none of us want another lockdown.

Still ambitious, he hopes to meet his hero, Gordon Ramsay. Omari also plans to release a second book this year. All this after he says his SAT hopes at school were written off by teachers convinced he would fail. “I was a bit down at the time because I thought I could pass those exams,” Omari says. “But I moved on by cooking and being home schooled. How incredible is Omariaposs story  Let us know your thoughts in the comment section “It’s a dream come true to do my book. I might have dyslexia but I managed to get it done. My inspirations are Gordon Ramsay because he’s a personal chef just like me. “Also the actor from Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman. Because he made me realise that whatever goes on in your le that’s miserable, you should carry on.” Omari’s self-belief was such that, aged just , he contacted Roger Wade, CEO of London food hall BoxPark asking for backing. “I messaged him on LinkedIn and askedI could have a restaurant at Boxpark when I’m older. “He said to me, ‘Why wait  You can have it now for free!’” Having waived the £, rent for the week-long stint at his Croydon location, Wade allowed Omari to bill himself as the “world’s youngest restaurateur”, surpassing eleven and-a-half-year-old Flynn McGarry who, in , ran a restaurant out of his Calornia home. Omari debuted Dipalicious, his own brand, bringing Caribbean cuisine to a whole new audience. Why vegan  “Well, I want people to be more healthy,” he says.  “Also because I didn’t like the way that animals were treated for food and clothes.” His offerings ranged from simple dishes such as pumpkin soup and vegetable curry to barbecue jackfruit with breadfruit chips and spinach-like dish callaloo. Omari, who lives with his family in Peckham has also produced a range of kids meals along with his own dipping sauces which remain a big hit online. His first book, Omari McQueen’s Best Bites, was released last month. He started in the kitchen, however, as a seven-year-old inspired by mum Leah. When she was struck down with paralysing migraines, Omari came into his own.  Dad Jermaine had previously taught him how to prepare meals but Omari was determined to go one better. Leah, , explains: “I’d be in and out of hospital and times I was in a wheelchair. Omari went from, ‘Okay, I’m just cooking now and again’ to ‘I’m cooking every day. It’s gonna make you feel better’. He was on a mission to make me healthy again.” His cooking exploits didn’t go according to plan. “When I first started cooking pasta, for example, I couldn’t get the right consistency,” he says. “It would be too soft, too squishy, too hard, or the bottom of the pot would get burnt!”  Once he struck the right formula, however, everything  fell into place. Omari writes his own menus, has his own YouTube channel and, after seeking out a literary agentto get his first book published, has a sequel in the works. Leah says: “I’m proud. I never doubted him. “I took him out of school at Year Five because the teachers said he wasn’t capable of doing his SATs in Year Six with his dyslexia. “In meetings there were so many can’ts. Omari sat in on every single one of those meetings and eventually I told him, “Do you know what – you can, you know ’ “I started buying cookbooks. I knew that all he wanted to do was cook. I bought the Food Tech GCSE book and I’d do tests with him. But he’d do his own research for science. “As he expanded his vocabulary I realised homeschooling really was best for him. Instead of trying to get him to perfect everything, I got him to understand everything he does. “I’ve since seen the teacher in question in a supermarket car park. “She told me I’d done an amazing job. It made me quite emotional. When you decide to home-school your child you take on a financial commitment. You don’t get any extra help. But we were committed.”  The youngster’s CBBC TV show, What’s Cooking Omari, came about after the director’s partner visited the Boxpark and spotted him in the kitchen. Leah says: “She saw Omari cooking up the food, he brought it to her and she said, ‘Mum, do you know what  I’m going to have to take your email address!’ “When we look at all the people we have worked with, the most important thing is that Omari is spoken to in a way that shows he is involved in the decision making. “It’s his vision. And, to be fair, that’s exactly what his publishers and the show director have followed. We’ve already filmed the first  episodes and they have respected his dreams and goals.”  Omari added: “I love the show so much because I get to bring my family into it and it’s fun for other children to watch.” His brother, Laquarn, , has ambitions of his own to become a film producer and is responsible for inspiring the prodigy to show his charisma on camera. Leah, who is also mum to Mahkai, , Kiara, nine, Kainon, seven and their cousin Jaylen, also seven, says: “Omari is my quietest child! It was Laquarn, who set up his YouTube channel and got him to explain what he was doing when he cooks on camera. Among Omari’s favourite dishes are his lasagne or his vegan shepherd’s pie. Jermaine also pushes his son to experiment in the kitchen as the pair enjoy cooking challenges.  Unsurprisingly Omari’s dishes are popular with his extended family. “Last weekend my mum said to him, ‘You’re not going to be on TV doing all this cooking and not cook for me!” Leah laughed. “He made her a three-course meal with banana fritters for the starter, chickpea curry with a roti and rice and peas for main and the dessert was a strawberry cheesecake. He was in the kitchen all day!” The youngster, however, plans to help other children with the dficulties his family has faced.

Every customer aged over  will be forced to sign in - rather than just one member of a big group as was the case last year. It is also unclear whether payment at the bar will be permitted. From April , pubs will be outdoors-only, and in rural areas particularly, poor broadband could make paying for drinks dficultcustomers are not allowed inside. And hospitality bodies are also troubled by reports that the Government will introduce vaccine passports from June , requiring punters to have either been jabbed or provide proof of a negative test. UK Hospitality , the British Beer  Pub Associationand the British Institute of Innkeepersbranded the measures as impractical burdens. In a joint statement, the pub representatives said: Government has promised the country that we will be reopening but we are now being told that this will be with our hands tied behind our backs. It now seems the hospitality industry could be burdened with vaccine passports, over-complicated test and trace rules and an inability not able to take payments indoors at reopening - a triple whammy for hard-pressed publicans who have been forcibly closed for months. Pubs will already be trading at a loss when they reopen with all the existing restrictions and Covid-secure measures in place.  Adding further disproportionate and discriminatory measures threatens the very survival of thousands of businesses. Itaposs unfair to single out our sector again with these added impractical burdens that will have economic consequences and risk our recovery. Carl Ford, an accountant based in Tamworth, told the BBC he was frustrated and confused by the rules. I feel like itaposs almost like going back to school where I have to sign in and out, he said.  I donapost understand why I have to do this in a restaurant or pub, but I donapost need to do this in a supermarket where you have a free for all. People donapost have to sign in and they can pick up fruit with their hands. Pubs will open beer gardens from April  with punters allowed indoors on May . A full reopening with no social distancing could be on the cards from June  when the Government hopes to have done away with all Covid rules. A government spokeswoman said: Public health rules are kept under constant review and we are providing as much flexibility for pubs and other hospitality businesses as possible. The roadmap [to reopening] set out that hospitality would open from step two, and removed any requirements for curfews or a substantial meal for customers. She said no final decisions had been taken on whether Covid-status certication could play a role in reopening the economy. Meanwhile, ministers have been warned against introducing vaccine passports in England by a cross-party group of politicians including senior Conservative MPs and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.More than  MPs, including  Conservatives, as well as peers from the House of Lords, have launched a campaign to oppose the move which they say would be isive and discriminatory. Reports in The Dailysuggested a series of pilot tests for Covid passports were being planned which could include the FA Cup final and other sporting events in May, although Number  maintained any proposals were still under review.Earlier this week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested the British instinct could be against the use of such a scheme.With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

William Anderson, from Edinburgh, spent years hooked on the drug before coming clean last March, and he now wants to help others turn their lives around. The -year-old, who lives in a PSL flat, says the drugs are a massive problem with people able to access them far too easily and cheaply.William told Edinburgh Live he would regularly purchase batches of  tablets for £ a time at the height of his addiction.He says heaposd only have to walk a few minutes from his front door and heaposd be able to get his hands on them.The father-of-four was inspired to reach out to Paul Boggie, who runs a support group, and get help for his problem after an incident where he unwittingly approached his son and a group of friends asking to buy drugs while high.He also took  pills and attempted to overdose, thinking there was no way out of his addiction. However after a year clean he says heaposs never felt better, and shared an image on social media this week to highlight the dference in his own appearance. William first started taking the street valium after coming off a diazepam prescription he had been on for decades around three years ago. He said: What happened was I met a person when I was out and they offered me four times the amount of valium as I was getting through my prescription. I thought it sounded good so I took it.  Then when I went for a urine test they found traces of the drug, and I was taken off my prescription. That was it, I wasnapost able to get back on it. He added: I was in a bad place with my mental health around then. Iaposd split up with my partner and I didnapost feel asI had any further purpose. I just wanted to block everything out. I then fell out with a lot of my family, because of my valium use, and things got worse. That led to me, last February, trying to overdose. I took  tablets, cocaine, Xanax and numerous other pills. All I remember was waking up in my mumaposs house four or five days later. It only takes one tablet to kill you, so I was just lucky.

I still feel that shame, I remember it to this day. That day really gave me the kick up the backside I needed and I contacted Paul [Boggie] not long after that. William says the help he received while trying to get clean helped restore his faith in humanity. He said: I wouldaposve died, so it saved my le reaching out. I was  at the time but it just shows itaposs never too late to turn things around. The support I received from a support group really helped me.

Caitlin Jones was sentenced to more than five years in prison today after admitting the manslaughter of little Francesca Haworth. The eight-month-old was found unresponsive at an address in Blackpool at roughly .am on November , . She was rushed to hospital for treatment but sadly died later the same day, a court heard. A post-mortem-examination ruled the baby had been suffocated - which prosecutors called a deliberate and premeditated act. Preston Crown Court heard that Jones, , had asked at hospitalshe was going to be held responsible for the death.Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror.She also provided inconsistent information to police as they investigated, claiming she had found the tot unresponsive. Detectives seized a number of items including Jonesapos phone and iPad, on which they found searches related to suffocating babies. Analysis of the electronic equipment also found searches askingyou could be prosecuted over the suffocation of a baby, it was said. Lancashire Police believe these searches were made in the hours before the tragic totaposs death. Jones was arrested and later charged with murder in July . She tried to put suspicion on to her partner for a considerable period of time by blaming him for the searches, prosecutors said. But she was today jailed for five years and eight months after pleading guilty to manslaughter at an earlier court date. Det Ch Insp Gareth Willis, of Lancashire Police, said the death was utterly tragic, heartbreaking and wholly avoidable. A baby is reliant on the care and trust of her mother to be raised in safety, without harm, he said. Caitlin Jones was Francesca’s source of le and should have been her source of love.

She has never given any explanation as to what she did to Francesca or indeed why. Whatever her actions that morning she has admitted she intended to cause harm to her daughter which is inexplicable. What we do know is that in the hours before Francesca’s death, Jones made a number of internet searches relating to suffocation of babies and whether or not she could be arrested for such an offence. Just after am that morning she made efforts to carefully delete those searches from her device before contacting the emergency services at .am where she claimed to have only just found Francesca unresponsive with a blanket wrapped around her face. She provided inconsistent information about how she had found Franscesca and what condition she was in. Her behaviour at hospital, askingshe would be held responsible, so soon after her daughter’s death, was both concerning and unnerving. My thoughts remain with Francesca’s father and her family who have conducted themselves with great dignity at what has been a very sad, dficult and distressing time. Senior District Crown Prosecutor Isla Chilton said: This was a tragic death of a young baby at the hands of her own mother. It was a deliberate and premeditated act by Caitlin Jones to suffocate her, and although she raised the alarm and called an ambulance by then it was too late.

Prescila Massia was stunned after winning the keys and said it will set her up financially for le. The -year-oldaposs new two-bedroom apartment boasts floor-to-ceiling windows, two balconies and an open-plan living and dining room. The new pad in Grays, Essex, is a far cry from the four-bedroom house she currently shares with her two parents and three siblings in Stratford, east London. She plans to stay put and cash in on the rent she will make on the new place. Prescila, who recently graduated with a degree in Psychology from Northampton University, bought  tickets for £ - but says she didnapost expect to win because sheaposs never won anything in her le. She said: I always used to take part in raffles when I was kid but never won. Itaposs been so overwhelming. I havenapost had time to take it all in, Iaposve just had so many messages. I am young and usually someone so young wouldnapost win anything like this.This is completely le-changing.

I still need time to process it all.

In October, nurse and single mum Cynthia Kanyua, , won a £, flat in another £ raffle run by the Twenefour Brothers. House raffles have seen a boom since the beginning of the pandemic. Numerous owners struggling to sell have raffled instead as they often make the asking price and more. The Twenefour brothers sold enough tickets to make a total of £, for the home won by Prescila.

The post-Brexit measures have already seen a group of British expats kicked out of Spain just minutes after arriving there. There are also fears for thousands of pensioners who are already living in Spain, but itaposs not the only country thataposs affected by the changes. The rules are to do with the residency status of foreigners living in European countries and as the UK has left the EU that means the protection previously afforded to Brits no longer stand. It has been claimed that some British expats have been aposburying their heads in the sandsapos despite being warned the changes were looming. There have been unconfirmed reports police in the Costas are ready to boot out  aposillegalapos UK citizens while in other EU countries Brits living there will also face challenges. Here we look at the new rules and what it means for you.Have you or someone you know been affected by the Brexit rules in Spain  Contact us at webnews@mirrorWhat are some of the new rules affecting British ex-pats Brits overseas, including tourists and second-home owners, are no longer allowed to spend more than  days in the EU without residency, as of April . Those who fail to apply for a residency or have it rejected needed to leave by March  or be deemed an illegal immigrant. For any future ex-pats, each nation has a tailored requirement for residency that now applies to Brits as non-EU members and it can take months to get a decision. But these arenapost the only rules that are causing problems for some Brits. One of the other requirements in Spain means expats earning less than £, a year could also face deportation. This will potentially affect thousands of British pensioners living there, whose only source of income is the UKaposs state pension of just over £, a year. Spain has also been rolling out a new system to register permanent foreign residents with biometric cards called TIE but due to so many requests the process has ground to a halt. And in France, Brits have been told they must swap their UK driving licence for a French one in a few months time or they will be unable to drive legally.The situation is further complicated by the travel restrictions placed on countries currently due to the coronavirus pandemic, with many European nations facing a third wave of infections. Why is it happening now  When the UK left the EU on January ,  a withdrawal agreement set the terms of the UK’s departure and the transition period ended on December , . This meant EU freedom of movement laws would no longer apply. As such Brits are no longer entitled to the same treatment as when the UK was still part of the European Union, including the right to live and work overseas. Wednesday, March  was the key date as it was  days after the end of transition and so the first time Brits would be affected by the new  day stay limit. Referring to the situation in Spain, a spokesman for the British embassy in Madrid said: When making plans to travel from the UK to Spain, a UK national must make sure that they meet both the requirements to leave the UK and those to enter Spain, bearing in mind that they are not the same. From March , entry to Spain will only be granted to those passengers who can demonstrate that their journey is essential, as well as those who are already legally resident in Spain. Ultimately, the decision on whether to grant entry into Spain is made by Spanish border officials. Can Brit expats still live overseas  If a Brit became a legal resident of the EU before January , , they will be allowed to stay. Those with legal residence can continue to have broadly the same rights to work, study and access public services and benefits as before the UK left the EU. If you have lived in an EU country for less than five years then will be able to stay for as long as you meet one of the residence conditions.Each country has dferent requirements, and you can find out what they are on the UK Government website here.You must spend at least  months in any  month period in your EU country to keep your residence rights. Brits who want to move overseas and become expats in the EU post-Brexit can still do so but will find it a more complicated process than before.

Edina Szilveszter, , was rushed to AE in May last year after suffering a number of seizures. She had told pals she did not feel like herself in the days prior to the episode but did not have any typical signs of illness.Warehouse worker Edina, from Warrington, underwent surgery after her diagnosis to remove the tumour, reports the Liverpool Echo.She then had extensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy and is still receiving support from specialist nurses.Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. Edina said: Before the seizure, I’d never felt any typical symptoms of a tumour such as headaches or blurred vision.But I could just tell something felt off within my head. I couldn’t put my finger on it but I would tell my friends and all of them knew I had these feelings. So whilst my diagnosis was an awful shock, I sort of knew something was happening. Edina had surgery at The Walton Centre, Liverpool, followed by further treatment at The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre. Originally from Hungary, she and partner Laszlo moved to Britain from Romania five years ago. With her family back in Transylvania, Edina relied on friends for support while Laszlo continued to work. My surgery went well and I was discharged five days later. But that first month was tough, she said.  I was so tired, my vision was blurred and I was very emotional. Laszlo had to go back to work but I was unable to do anything for myself. My mum had her flights cancelled to come and support me, so some friends moved in instead to help out. During that time, I felt so worried I would never feel normal again. But I tried not to let Laszlo or my family know how I was feeling. If I was positive, they would be positive. I hid my feelings from them to protect them. The cancer centre helped Edina with a dedicated clinical nurse specialist, who helps her in all manner of ways. She said: When I do need to talk to someone, I have a dedicated social worker who rings me every week.

They support all of us. My diagnosis has also been a trauma for Laszlo but knowing I have someone on the end of the phone. Whether it’s to help me when I’m feeling unwell or someone to express my feelings to, helps us both.Dr Shaveta Mehata, consultant clinical oncologist at The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust, is leading Edina’s care.She said: While brain tumours are very rare, it is common for patients to not experience any symptoms. Unfortunately, brain tumours are often diagnosed in AE, as was the case with Edina. Treating and caring for patients with a brain tumour is very complex. We work closely with other hospitals across the region, such as The Walton Centre, and meet weekly to discuss each of our patients. It’s vital that we offer treatment and support quickly and in the right setting so that patients can benefit from better quality of le for as long as possible. Edina shaved her hair off following her surgery, which she said has made her feel reborn.

The sheets are notoriously dficult to fold neatly thanks to the elastic edges, which is why theyaposre often bundled into a little ball and shoved into a cupboard. So thankfully, organisational guru Marie Kondo has shared how to overcome this laundry struggle in just five easy steps.Most people know Marie Kondo as the author of the best-selling book The Le Changing Magic of Tidying Up and the star of the hit Netflix show Tidying Up with Marie Kondo.Now, with her KonMari method, folding a sheet is - dare we say it - easy. The first step is to lay the fitted sheet on a completely flat surface with the elastic band facing up. Then, fold the sheet in thirds wise by bringing one long side into the middle, then the other. You should be left with one long rectangle, which youaposll need to then fold in half widthwise. Once youaposve rolled the sheet from one short side to the other, youaposll be left with a neat and compact cylinder shape that can easily be stored.

Similarly in the world of baby names, popular celebrities and trends can lead to a whole generation of babies having the same name. But whataposs perfect for one set of parents might be considered extremely unsuitable by another mum-to-be. Deciding on a name for your child is a deeply personal and tricky job to do. Popular website Nameberry has taken a look at what are the most popular names for babies born this year - and there are some excellent additions to the top ten. Pamela Redmond, the CEO and co-founder of Nameberry, said many of the names reflect peopleaposs desire for the outdoors after a year largely spent in lockdown. Currently, Luna is the most-searched-for girlsapos name on the website - the name of the Roman moon goddess. Itaposs also the name of Chrissy Teigen and John Legendaposs daughter, who frequently appears on the coupleaposs Instagram accounts. Arlo has become the most popular boys name, shooting up the chart to replace last yearaposs winner Milo. There are three newcomers to the girlsapos top ten list - Iris, Freya and Hazel. They have replaced Charlotte, Ophelia, Eleanor - which have slipped into the top twenty. Kai, Finn, Ezra, Rowan and Jude are the new additions to the boysapos list after a major reshuffle. Meanwhile, Asher, Oliver, Levi, Theodore, Jasper have dropped out of the top ten.

in a dramatic Championship clash on Saturday night.That followed on from a comfortable - win away to Alloa eight days earlier.Both matches were graced by well-worked goals scored by the Dark Blues via set pieces, with Lee Ashcroft’s head getting on the end of Paul McGowan’s corners.The combination has yielded three goals for Ashcroft himself, while another of his headers off a McGowan delivery was saved by Pars keeper Owain Fon Williams before Danny Mullen tapped in the loose ball.There is no doubt that canny Saints boss Callum Davidson will have that particular threat written down in his notebook for the cup-tie, but McPake will still be hoping they can still hurt the Premiership top-six side.The Dundee boss said: “We spend a lot of time on them and set plays are huge in football.“You see games won and lost because of them all the time.“It was a set play that enabled us to get a foothold against Alloa in the game the other week.“Then we got back to - against Dunfermline thanks to one before our winning goal, which was also scored from a set play.“So they really are important.“I would be lyingI was standing here and taking any credit for that because it is about good deliveries and players being brave.“I think that is now two good wins for us now going into what is a massive Scottish Cup tie, with St Johnstone coming here.“They have had a great season under Callum and made the top six and won a cup so it’s going to be a test of our character again.“However, I know we will work hard again and show the belief that we have been doing.“It is one I am looking forward to.”McPake admitted, looking back, that the Dunfermline match was a must-win for him and his players and is delighted that they passed that formidable test.He added: “It think it was a must-win but you would never come out and say that before the game as you would fall flat on your faceyou didn’t win.“Then you would be looking for answers.“But, with these last two results and the way it’s being going for the players, we are looking forward to Saturday.”LEE WILKIE: St Johnstone clash can give Dundee an indicator of where they#re at and why a Scottish Cup run could be transformative for Dundee United\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: St Johnstone clash can give Dundee an indicator of where they#re at and why a Scottish Cup run could be transformative for Dundee United# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-column-dundee-fc-dundee-united-st-johnstone-scottish-cup embed # secretNhOePHygC\" data-secret\"NhOePHygC\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.44872307-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.44872307-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.44872307-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.44872307-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"pervert oap caught with hundreds of sick images of kids and animals has sentence postponed","story":"A pervert pensioner found with hundreds of sick images of child abuse and bestiality has had his sentencing postponed.

has been shut ever since it was almost destroyed by Storm Frank in  has finally been reopened, after extensive repair efforts by Aberdeenshire Council.The cast-iron Cambus O’May suspension bridge between Aboyne and Ballater was left twisted and mangled by the rising waters of the River Dee, when Storm Frank caused major flooding all across the north-east more than five years ago.In the aftermath of the disaster, the B-listed structure, first built in , lay ruined and inaccessible for years.But today, after a “major undertaking” by the council and fundraising from the Ballater Royal Deeside group, as well as a personal donation by Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay in , it has finally been reopened to all.It is the final bridge that was damaged in Aberdeenshire by Storm Frank to be officially repaired and put back into use.A statement from the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay said: “We are delighted the Cambus O’ May footbridge is at last being reopened after five years of closure due to Storm Frank.Prince Charles steps in to help save historic Cambus O#May bridge ravaged by Storm Frank\" title\"#Prince Charles steps in to help save historic Cambus O#May bridge ravaged

pulled together once again with very generous donations ensuring the bridge will once again be used and enjoyed by locals and visitors alike.”Work on the repairs was due to finish last year, but the project was severely delayed by the pandemic.Over the past number of months, the bridge has been carefully worked on by contractors, but now all the scaffolding has been removed and the public can use it once again.Currently, there are no plans for an official grand opening event, but it is understood one could take place in the future.Donald MacPherson, bridges manager for Aberdeenshire Council, said: “It has been a major undertaking to repair the Cambus O’ May suspension bridge and our thanks go to contractors Moray Blast for the very impressive work they have undertaken.“I would also like to thank Ballater Royal Deeside for their very successful community fundraising effort and the Scottish Government for providing the remaining funding which enabled these works to be undertaken.“This is the last bridge to be repaired in Aberdeenshire following the devastating Storm Frank and it really highlights a determination on the part of the community to protect these important listed assets to the benefit of all.”Susan Cooksley, manager of the Dee Catchment Partnership, added: “We#re delighted that this iconic bridge over the Dee has been fully restored and is once again open to the public.“The power of Storm Frank was a lesson for all of us in the devastating consequences of flooding, and we need to carry these lessons forward as we work together to create a catchment that is more resilient to the effects of climate change.“The Cambus O# May bridge is one of many beautul and popular spots on the River Dee, and we look forward to seeing visitors ing there to enjoy

The figure is % for those aged  to , and more than % of those aged between  and  have also had their jabs.Those figures are expected to rise as appointments continue in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, the number of people in hospital with Covid- has also fallen to its lowest level since October – the start of the second wave of the pandemic.As of March , there were  people in hospital with the virus, a figure which has since fallen into single figures.The north-east’s infection rates are among the lowest in the country, with the number of coronavirus tests coming back positive at less than % of those carried out, compared to a national average of more than %.Cases have levelled off in recent days following a slight rise.The report reads: “In overall terms, all three local authority areas in Grampian have had a lower rate of prevalence of Covid than where in Scotland, with the position having improved since the peak of the second national wave in January.“Whilst noting the positive position locally and the support we have had from the general public and key partners, Covid remains a global pandemic with iation in terms of new cases presenting across each continental area.“The current seven-day positivity rates in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray are .%, .% and .% respectively compared to the national average of .%.”NHS Grampian was also due to exit Operation Snowdrop – its plan for dealing with the pandemic – into a transition phase today.The programme was implemented in January in response to the second wave to ensure hospitals could cope.A report reads: “The process for exiting Operation Snowdrop and the transitional business model were formally signed off by Gold Command during March .“Whilst moving to the transitional model, all the key elements of the board’s Covid response will remain in place for the foreseeable future.”Meanwhile, a separate report to the board revealed the dental profession is facing “signicant recruitment issues” as a result of the pandemic.Undergraduate students have been unable to take part in vocational training because of ongoing restrictions.The report reads: “Although raised by more than one profession, the main concerns around the impact on staff training is from the dental profession.“The pandemic response caused the closure of most dental services and signicantly reduced the clinical training for undergraduate dentists.“As a result, the graduation from all dental schools in Scotland will be delayed although the Aberdeen students will graduate in December .“These graduates will not be able to start the vocational training as the current trainees will not yet have moved on and the next opportunity in Scotland is September .“However in England, there is also a March  intake and there is considerable risk that graduates will take up posts where.“Overall there will be signicant recruitment issues and as the profession is already dealing with a signicant backlog of patient treatments there will be an increased pressure to fill roles.“There will also be only half intake in  and this has the potential to have an ongoing reduced output in a number of years which could raise the possibility of reduced workforce.”The NHS Grampian board was due to meet today at am.Coronavirus in Scotland – track the spread in these charts and maps\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland – track the spread in these charts and maps# #

the UK#s most northern outlet and the only one in Scotland outside the central belt.It follows the closure of Debenhams, which has closed its stores in both Aberdeen and Inverness.The announcement sparked outrage from shoppers and members of the public in the north-east, with thousands of people aiming to convince the retail giant to reconsider.Two petitions have been set up, with a combined total of more than , people signing in support of the campaign.Many also added comments sharing why they want the partnership to stay in the Granite City.Chris Cusack described the store as #an important fixture in the city centre, and an essential part of its retail economy#, while Alison Murray claimed the region would be #bereft#the closure goes ahead.Dawn Allen said: #We desperately need to preserve the jobs and it is a three-hour drive to the next nearest store. Aberdeenshire needs John Lewis, not just the city itself.#And Karen Young added: #I worked in John Lewis for years and it was the best store in town. I think this will be a terrible loss to Aberdeen and it breaks my heart that those amazing staff will no longer do the jobs they live and are committed to.#A taskforce, including council chiefs and business leaders, held talks earlier this week with senior management at John Lewis.The campaign to save the store has also been backed by candidates standing in Aberdeen Central in the upcoming Scottish Parliament election.Scottish Labour candidate Barry Black, who set up one of the petitions calling for the closure decision to be reversed, said: #There is a mixture of anger and huge disappointment at the decision. This is the last department store in Aberdeen.#People do have confidence in the future of Aberdeen city centre but they see John Lewis as a huge part of that future. It#s the anchor of that side of the city centre, and there are a lot of retailers in George Street who have grave concerns because of the people it draws to that part of town.#This is much bigger than Aberdeen city. To the public in Aberdeenshire, Moray, the Highlands and even Orkney and Shetland, it#s their local department store.#Douglas Lumsden, the Scottish Conservative candidate, said: #I haven#t seen a public response like this for a long time.

Aberdeen is quite far up north, it#s far away from everyone , it#s quite a big move to make but having a name like John Lewis it makes it not feel as far away, it puts us on the map.#It#s a big employer, a lot of students can go to John Lewis on placement, so it#s a big part of the community there.#We don#t have any other department stores here anymore and it is important to have that one-stop shop andwe lose this, it will be very sad.#For people relocating, it can be quite a big thing to have a John Lewis in the city and when you are trying to attract people up here, it is definitely a draw.#Ms Morgan has many fond memories of working in the store between  and , and made a lelong friend while travelling to work on the train from Stonehaven.A fellow colleague started up a conversation with her after spotting her badge, and they are still friends today.Ms Morgan said: #I absolutely loved working there, there was a fantastic community spirit, there were other students there from the city and it was such a vibrant place, with a good atmosphere and good social element as well.#It was a great place to meet local people and be part of something, I was proud to be part of it, working in the city and with the brands I grew up with, I#m from Kent originally so I knew John Lewis in Milton Keynes so loved working there.#I learned so many interpersonal skills there as it was such a nice place to work.#John Lewis helped me settle into Aberdeen when I moved here and starting working there as I was mixing with people all dferent ages from the city, and felt like I became part of the city.#The -year-old has lived in Aberdeenshire since she was  and backed our campaign to save the store from closure.She added: #We need the profile of John Lewis being in Aberdeen, we don#t need another empty building of that size.#I don#t knowJohn Lewis#s mind has been fixed, orits too late to save it, but we need to try and convince them that it is financially viable to keep open.#Local people need to get involved and pledge to put their money where their mouth is, we need to really do something as a community, and the councillors to show them the wider picture of the

sculpture trail will arrive in Aberdeen for  days next month – and city art bosses say it will mark ato people enjoying arts in the city centre.Restless Worlds will see moving installations in windows and public spaces offering “magical worlds” created by some of Scotland’s leading sculptors, animators and puppeteers at eight sites around the city centre, from May  to .The art walk is being staged in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow by Puppet Animation Scotland under the banner of its MANIPULATE Festival, with Aberdeen Performing Arts as partners in the Granite City.Ben Torrie, director of programming and creative projects for APA, said: “We’re looking forward to bringing some much needed joy and offering something for everyone to look forward to. The sculptures and artwork are extraordinary and take in some iconic locations around the city so we are looking forward to sharing them.“More than that, right now, it’s a step back to enjoying artistic experiences like we all love to do, but have been deprived of in the past  months.”The eight artists commissioned to create the works have been inspired by Boccaccio’s  novel The Decameron.Ben said: “It is about a group of  people quarantining from a plague, who are telling each other stories to pass the time, stories which get ever more ridiculous. It was like a lockdown for them, the th century version of Covid-.”While all eight sites have yet to be confirmed, Ben said one, possibly two, sculptures will be in the glass foyer of His Majesty’s Theatre. Wherever the sculptures are, they can be viewed from the street, keeping the trail Covid-secure.Ben said: “The full experience involves purchasing a ticket and downloading the full map and all the detailed information about the pieces, with an accompanying soundtrack of both music and narrative.“I think in and of itself it’s a really interesting artwork trail and hopefully will take people by surprise. You will have little moments of curiosity as you are going about the city centre.”Restless Worlds had been planned as part of the MANIPULATE festival, but was postponed due to Covid- restrictions, as the event moved online in February.Dawn Taylor, Puppet Animation Scotland’s director said: “We are so excited to finally be able to share these works with the public after having to postpone our original plans due to the lockdown.“The installation features both leading Scottish artists and exciting emerging new voices, who between them have an extraordinary range of backgrounds, including puppetry, sculpture, filmmaking, object theatre, photography, generative design and theatre.“After so long without access to theatres and galleries, Restless Worlds offers audiences a really unique and distinctive Covid-safe arts experience – part exhibition, part storytelling, and something you can enjoy at your own pace as you wander around the city.”To find out more and purchase tickets, visit MANIPULATEfestival.orgFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/03/KFX-240321-01-09_38344761-scaled-e1616593099578-940x564.jpg ","title":"time is of the essence city taskforce to make last ditch effort to keep john lewis in aberdeen","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAberdeen leaders will launch a taskforce in a last ditch effort to convince John Lewis bosses to rethink the closure of the much-loved city department store.High-level talks have taken place between the company’s management and local politicians who want to put “everything on the table” to preserve the retail space and save  jobs.It comes as the John Lewis Partnership confirmed that no final decision on the store#s fate has yet been made, and as a petition to save it was backed by more than , people.Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce chief executive Russell Borthwick warned that “time is of the essence”the city is to “come together as a community” and persuade decision-makers at John Lewis to change their minds.Mr Borthwick said: #We have a choice.#Do we accept the decision is a done deal, that the future of retail is online and pursue other long term uses for our city centre in the hope that the eco-system can still operate without one of its key components, or do we collectively come together as a community to engage with the decision-makers at John Lewis, to convince them to work with us to build a business model that works – I say, the latter.“What do we collectively have in our lockers that could be used to do this #Time is of the essence. Can we be successful in working with John Lewis to convince them to change their minds #Maybe not, butwe do nothing, we already know the outcome.#Special: Your thoughts on the plans to close John LewisCustomers could face six-hour round trip to #nearest store#Aberdeen branch shutsClosure of Illicit Still rubs #salt in the wound# of John Lewis#s planned departureLetter from the editor: Now is the time to make your voice heard and save our city centre tooThe John Lewis Partnership has said it will listen to proposals put forward by city leaders and politicians in an “appropriate consultation process”.A spokeswoman added it was “too early” to discuss details on any plans but said the firm was “actively having conversations with Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce, stakeholders and local politicians”.SNP candidate for Aberdeen Central, Kevin Stewart, also took part in talks with John Lewis management and called for the new taskforce to work to “ensure all opportunities” have been assessed.The proposals are understood to include a new retail space where in the city centre and the potential for a Waitrose supermarket to be added to the George Street space to increase footfall.Mr Stewart said: “The Scottish Government stand ready to assist in terms of redundancies, but as a city, we need to come together and put in place a credible, and politically neutral, taskforce to put everything on the table and ensure all opportunities have been assessed.#New figures show Aberdeen city centre footfall has fallen by more than % during the pandemic, while % of sales at John Lewis have shted online.Adrian Watson, the chief executive of business development group Aberdeen Inspired, said city leaders were “still fighting” to keep the high street giant.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden added: “Everyone needs do everything they can to get John Lewis to overturn this decision – I think it’s quite short sighted.“On Tuesday we had the huge announcement from the UK Government on the £ billion investment into the energy sector and the £ million that we’ve committed to the city centre and beach regeneration.“I would have liked to see John Lewis open the store again and seesome of these things would have an impact on the store.“You would like to think that our local economy will bounce back because of that investment.“But it’s clear from what John Lewis said that they are only really interested in the online market in the north-east, and that is regrettable and something we really need to keep on at them to seethey’ll change their mind.”For as

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence.

Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day. For just £., it will feed a hungry child every day for an entire school year.And because the childhood meals our mothers made often stay with us, reminding us of being nurtured and loved, we have included a favourite childhood recipe from TV presenter Lorraine Kelly with each gt card.Please visit marysmeals.org.uk mothersday to purchase your gt card or digital gt.I know I’d love itmy three lovely children gave me this special present for Mother’s Day.Gillian McMahon, director of supporter engagement and income, Mary’s MealsSir,Launching its manesto ahead of the Scottish elections, the Stroke Association in Scotland is reminding people that stroke remains a clinical priority in Scotland amid the pandemic.Covid- has been tough for all of us. Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#.

programme focusing on how the role of prime minister has changed over the past  years.vw,vw,px, px\"The BBC spoke with former prime ministers including Tony Blair, David Cameron and Sir John Major ldquoI donrsquot think I did enjoy the job because the responsibility is so huge, explained Mr Blair.ldquoEvery day yoursquore making decisions and every day yoursquore under massive scrutiny as is your family.ldquoSo I didnrsquot knowI enjoyed it.ldquoThe paradox is that you start at your most popular and least capable and you end at your least popular and most capable.The former Labour leader also compared his experience of becoming prime minister to that of a fan being appointed as manager of Manchester United.He said: ldquoThe crazy thing about the job is that itrsquos the only job I can think of in which the importance of what yoursquore doing is so immense and the requirement of experience for doing it is so nugatory.ldquoThe first job I ever had in government was prime minister.ldquoI use the analogy of a football team.ldquoIf yoursquore looking for the new coach of Manchester United and lsquoI tell you what wersquore going to find the most enthusiastic and persuasive fan we can find and put in him charge of the teamrsquo.ldquoPeople would say yoursquore insane.The BBC programme also spoke with former prime ministers David Cameron and Sir John Major, as well as to the current office holder Boris Johnson.Recalling his own experiences of the job, Mr Cameron said that the office is underpowered in comparison to other government departments.ldquoEveryone thinks Number  is all powerful because it is the office of the prime minister.ldquoBut of course Number  is very small, underpowered, compared to these massive departments of state, he said.ldquoI remember joking after a few months that you spend far too much time trying to find what the Governmentrsquos actually doing and quite a lot of time trying to stop it.He added: ldquoI used to find during the day that I would often pop up and make a sandwich for lunch.ldquoBecause you do need a bit of time to be able to be on your own and just think and just breathe.ldquoJust a few moments of peace at lunchtime and making a cheese sandwich and eating it alone.ldquoThese were really valuable moments.Mr Johnson meanwhile paid tribute to the teams which help support prime ministers in their role at Downing Street.He told the BBC: ldquoThe great thing about being in Number , as I think probably any prime minister has found, is that itrsquos a job that is brilliantly supported by a massive team of people who have all evolved over hundreds of years into what is a big department of state now.ldquoAnd what yoursquove got is a th century townhouse, rather beautul.ldquoSo this is an incredible institution that has evolved over time into this extraordinary centre of a G economy.The first of three programmes in the series will air on BBC Radio  at  am on Friday April

Councilrsquos countryside rangers, who are also targeting other sites in the county.A council spokeswoman said that, as the weather improved, the days ened and people exercised outdoors, it was appropriate to remind dog walkers to keep dogs under control.She said: ldquoAt this time of year in countryside sites there may be young birds or nests that can be disturbed by dogs running off lead.ldquoThe posters are to remind dog owners to keep their pets close to hand and not to encourage behaviour that may cause problems to wildle or indeed other visitors.ldquoThis issue of countryside

have an adverse impact on wildle.ldquoIt has been estimated around . million pets had been bought in the UK during lockdown.

We are entering the breeding season and last year was a very poor year for ground nesting birds, which is thought to be largely due to disturbance.ldquoSkylarks, meadow pipit and grey partridge are the key species in Musselburgh that suffer from disturbance.ldquoThe key message is lsquoareas of uncut coastal grassland may have nesting birds presentrsquo.

The message is to think about where to walk your dog. Try to avoid estuaries where birds are feeding and remember that nature reserves and coastal grassland are sensitive areas.Jason Rose, chairman of community group Friends of Musselburgh Links, said: ldquoThis has been an issue on and off over the years but does seem to have got worse in recent weeks.

There is fencing all the way round this area for a reason.ldquoThere is plenty of space where on the links to exercise dogs. Many owners are responsible, and we thank them.ldquoHowever, I also know that, on occasion, when a dog walker has been approached about disruptive behaviour, they have shown disinterest in the issue. These incidents clearly arenrsquot accidents and thatrsquos heartbreaking.ldquoThe lagoons are a Site of Special Scientic Interest and there were already prominent signs making this clear, asking people to stick to the paths and keep quiet.

electing their new representative next month.Four candidates - Euan Davidson , Craig Hoy , Paul McLennanand Martin Whitfield- are in the running for the role.Each week, the East Lothian Courier will give each of the candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Euan Davidson I SPENT last weekend in Dunbar and Haddington with local activists highlighting local issues of concern.The theme running through all of the problems we discussed is a lack of local empowerment.Too often, services are centralised and decisions are taken out of the hands of local people for example, the running down of services at Belhaven Hospital by the Scottish Government.If the SNP Health Secretary had agreed to a small upgrade grant back in -, signicantly more services could have been retained.Across the county, we see the same lack of joined-up thinking, with vast new housing estates lacking the essential additional infrastructure to support them: GP surgeries full, schools at capacity and non-existent public transport provision.A centralised police force has seen officers disappear from our streets.The closure of Haddingtonrsquos court forces victims and witnesses to travel into Edinburgh where there is a signicant backlog in cases.Liberal Democrats want to empower our communities to make decisions for themselves.The SNPrsquos centralising tendency damages our local services.Repeatedly, local decision-making is overturned by the Scottish Governmentrsquos reporters.Of course, media attention is focussed on the launch of the Alba Party and Kenny MacAskillrsquos defection.Mr MacAskill has said thatelected to Holyrood, he intends to stay an MP.Personally, I believe this is unacceptable.East Lothian deserves full-time representation at both Holyrood and Westminster.The other concern is that the SNP and Alba seem determined to turn this election into a referendum on independence.Itrsquos almost aswersquore not pinned down by a frightening pandemic asour economy is not on its knees aswe are not struggling against poverty and climate change emergencies asour education standards are not careering down international league tables.Letrsquos spend the next five weeks talking about what matters rather than a constitutional obsession.Craig Hoy NO SOONER was the election starting gun fired than blows were traded.Unlike normal campaigns, it wasnrsquot the cut and thrust of argument between parties hitting the headlines.Instead, Kenny MacAskill MP arrogantly turned his back on his SNP colleagues ndash and betrayed the trust of voters in East Lothian ndash by defecting to Alex Salmondrsquos Alba Party.I will fight this campaign positively, asking for the support of every pro-UK voter in this constituency.While campaigning canrsquot take place in the usual way, I have already spoken with hundreds of constituents by telephone and have delivered thousands of leaflets.Two clear themes have emerged.Firstly, people are sick of the sleaze, ision and incompetence of this SNP Government.And they no longer trust Labour on the Union.Residents donrsquot want to be dragged back to the ision of another independence referendum.Instead, they want the MSP who succeeds Iain Gray to be a strong voice for the interests of local people.Thatrsquos why I have announced five-point plans for towns and villages across East Lothian.We need to create more jobs, improve education, stop overdevelopment and tackle problems such as drugs and anti-social behaviour.The issue of tactical voting has also come up on the lsquovirtual doorsteprsquo.Labour is weak on the Union and can no longer win this seat.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out giving Holyrood power to hold another independence referendum.Labour wonrsquot agree to form a pro-UK coalition in opposition to the separatists.Voters fear that Labour simply canrsquot say no to Nicola Sturgeon.Anas Sarwar helped Nicola pass the Hate Crime Bill and sat on the fence over her misleading Parliament.I am clear that a vote for any of the smaller fringe parties will only split the pro-UK vote.In East Lothian, there is only one way of using your two votes to stop the SNP.By voting for me in the constituency vote ndash and Conservative on the party ballot paper ndash we can block an SNP majority and another referendum.By doing that, you will guarantee the next parliament will be focussed on rebuilding the economy and our communities.Paul McLennan AFTER meeting a number of environment groups in the past few weeks, Irsquove taken time this week to reflect on how we transform how our economy operates with improved stewardship of our environment.Societyrsquos underlying health and a sustainable environment need to be measured by more than just figures on a balance sheet.The Wellbeing Economy Allianceurges transforming how the economy operates, warning that unless we rethink who wins and who loses out ldquowe wonrsquot have a chance of delivering that goal: social justice on a healthy planet.We can explore immediately green jobs for economic development, protect wild spaces for animals to thrive and iniduals to enjoy, and sustain our landscape.The Trossachs and the Cairngorms are renowned as Scotlandrsquos only two national parks as your MSP, Irsquod work with agribusiness, rural communities, environmental and other groups to investigate the feasibility of the Lammermuirs becoming a third national park.This echoes the call by the National Trust for Scotland to explore further options for national parks in Scotland.A natural boundary between the Lothians and the Borders, the Lammermuirsrsquo stunning landscape and history would attract locals to access nature and enhance wellbeing, boosting the rural economy.Other measures specic to East Lothian are achievable, realistic and right for now, including engaging in Scotland as a recognised lsquoRe-wilding Nationrsquo.As MSP, Irsquoll also support a feasibility study for Haddington train station a planning bill overhaul to ensure new-builds include electric car points and  per cent of transport budgets designated for active transport.As a government, the SNP has introduced world-leading climate change policies.We have pledged net-zero emissions by  and are on course to meet that target.Last year, we generated . per cent of our electricity demand from renewables.This is displacing millions of tonnes of carbon a year, bringing jobs and enormous socio-economic impacts to our communities.Iceland and New Zealand, successful small democracies led by women, joined Scotland as Nicola Sturgeon pioneered the lsquoWellbeing Economy Governments Grouprsquo.Highlighting the inter-connection of personal and national wellbeing, Nicola argued ldquothe goal of economic policy should be collective wellbeing: how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy.I want East Lothian to lead on the transformative change our environment needs ndash we can be the change we all desire.Martin Whitfield I WAS joined by Scottish Labourrsquos new leader Anas Sarwar and local party members at the launch of my campaign.Its key message is that Labour will focus on what unites us and on recovery ndash not another isive referendum.Mr Sarwar told the virtual meeting that a lsquonational recovery planrsquo for Scotland would be the centrepiece of Scottish Labourrsquos election campaign, covering key priority areas for recovery from Covid, including jobs, the NHS, education, climate and communities.Speaking after the launch, Mr Sarwar said: ldquoScottish Labour, under my leadership, will make a national recovery our only priority.

The parking is the major issue and there is already double the number of residential properties in the town centre than parking spaces, so to create even more is just unacceptable in my mind.However, Dunbar community councillor Jacquie Bell, who said that the community council backed the application, described the decision as lsquodisappointingrsquo.She told the committee that the community council had been concerned about the future of the building for a long time.She said: ldquoWe do support the proposals and welcome the reduction in units.

It stemmed from childhood holidays there, and an artist mother who was \"mad about Italian\", he says. \"When we were kids, we grew up on her cooking from lots of Italian cookbooks.\"The London-born chef gets almost misty-eyed when talking about past meals in Italy - particularly the first time he tasted spaghetti alle vongole .He has a particular obsession with the Italian deli, confessing hes \"an obsessive shopper - I will go to a particular shop to buy one item, and Ill probably buy three dferent jars of passata\", who often comes home laden with anchovies, olive oil and as much cured meat as he can carry.\"I would say I havent got an Italian bone in my body, but I have an Italian soul,\" Randall muses - and he suggests we could all learn a lot about the countrys approach to food.\"Its about keeping things really simple and not overeating,\" he explains. \"Less is more - sometimes a really delicious plate of pasta is all you need, or maybe its a baked dish or a risotto -thats done really, really well, it doesnt have to have  ingredients in it. It could just be courgettes, butter, parmesan and some fresh basil.\"Randall champions the Italian way of \"frugal cooking\" too. \"Its making use of what youve got, rather than going out and buying things that are completely out of season, or making things too elaborate,\" he explains.\"I think were quite wasteful in lots of ways: people go to the supermarket, theyll do their shop and buy lots and lots of stuff. Theyll put it in the fridge, itll be in some sort of cellophane wrap, and about four or five days later, they realise they bought this asparagus and its gone off, so they just throw it away.\"When it comes to Italian food, the biggest mistake we could be making is usually with pasta. \"I think this is where we go wrong: we cook so much pasta that you end up having this huge bowl of pasta and you sit in front of the TV, then you go back for a second portion, and then about  minutes later youre lying on the sofa thinking, Oh my God, my stomach is about to explode because Ive eaten so much carbohydrates,\" Randall says with a moan.This is incredibly easy to do, particularly as most of us can whip up a pan of pasta with our eyes closed - and thats exactly what Randall wants us to avoid. \"We do things automatically, we become like robots and cook things and we have our own ways of doing things,\" he says. \"I think we need to open our eyes and look at Italian produce, and see whats out there and whats available.\"The chef thinks we should all be chasing that feeling of \"having something where youre literally licking the bowl and thinking, God, I wish I cooked more, but  minutes later youre actually fine, because youve digested\", he says.Good quality ingredients can help you get this feeling, which is why Randall has written a cookbook dedicated to the Italian deli. \"I think food has a personality, its very important that there is a story behind some of these things,\" he explains - and talking to experts in a deli can help uncover these stories and give genius tips for the kitchen. Little tweaks to classic meals can make a huge dference: Randall recommends cooking dried pasta two or three minutes less than the packet says, and adding some pasta water to the sauce for extra flavour.Immersing yourself in Italian food beyond a bowl of pesto pasta could help you out of your lockdown cooking rut: as Randall says, its \"very versatile, the kind of food you dont really ever get bored of\".Randall certainly hasnt got bored of Italian food in lockdown, and it doesnt look like he will any time soon. Anyone familiar with the cuisine will know its all about family big bowls of pasta and trays of pizza to be shared with your loved ones. Randalls son and daughter, Max and Lola, have even managed to inherit some of his Italian soul, with the chef exclaiming: \"Maxs love of pasta is almost equal mine!\"The Italian Deli Cookbook by Theo Randall, photography by Lizzie Mayson, is published by Quadrille, priced pound.

Not least because it will be a standing reminder of the controversy surrounding her governmentrsquos handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond.Opposition MSPs on a Holyrood committee combined to declare that she had misled them. However, she was cleared by an official inquiry of breaching the Ministerial code and she comfortably won a confidence motion.:BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralEarlier this week, SNP strategists were quietly hopeful that the worst of this issue was behind them. Ms Sturgeon must now hope that the momentum of an election campaign itself will subsume her former friendrsquos appeal.And so begins the first socially distanced election. The cynics among you may say that most people will find little trouble in staying far away from canvassing politicians. But, still, this contest really counts.Consider the cataclysmic changes since this Holyrood Parliament was elected in . Firstly, Brexit. The SNP will build upon that, but cautiously.They will recall that Scotland voted to remain in the EU and will argue that departure strengthens the case for independence. But, perhaps understandably, there will be few specics at this stage as to how and when Scotland would recreate links with Brussels.Secondly, the hideous plague. Self-evidently, the pandemic is the backdrop to the entire contest.Anecdotally, it would appear to be the received view that Nicola Sturgeon has worked tirelessly, although understandably Opposition parties will point to flaws.But what about broader strategy  The SNP will seek to build a post-pandemic economic and social consensus that ldquoScotlandrsquos recovery should be in Scotlandrsquos hands.That is couched to offend as few as possible. It most certainly includes the prospect of independence but does not explicitly rule out other devolved options, at least in the interim.In essence, it is a single transferable message: appealing to the underlying patriotic mood which created the SNP in the first place but also brought devolution into being.Of course, there is an added dimension. Most Nationalist speakers delivering their virtual stump speech will say ldquohellipin Scotlandrsquos hands, and not Boris Johnsonrsquos.They will seek to posit the Prime Minister as an external threat to Scotlandrsquos well-being, as antithetical to the Scottish perspective.Look at the four per cent pay offer to NHS staff in Scotland. SNP Ministers reckon that is genuinely merited and in keeping with the Scottish outlook. But it also helps that it is in contradistinction to the relative parsimony of the UK Government offer.It is also of course designed to quell Labour complaints, as is the move to take Scotrail into public ownership. Stand by for more universalism in the SNP manesto.The Conservative objective will be, as it was in , to corral supporters of the Union into voting Tory. They will depict their rivals as weak and vacillating, specically with regards to the prospect of a further independence referendum.Why then, you might ask, does Boris Johnson not pre-empt the issue by insisting that he will veto a referendum in any circumstances Because, of course, that would undermine the core of the Scottish Conservative campaign. They mean to depict the SNP as zealous fanatics, intent on independence, no matter what.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Alex Salmond launches pro-independence Alba Party ahead of Scottish election\",\"description\": \"Alex Salmond launches pro-independence Alba Party ahead of Scottish election\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media vRZxBmNB poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests vRZxBmNB.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": They plan to argue, further, that the only way to stop indyref is to prevent the SNP from gaining a majority at Holyrood. And they offer themselves as the ones to provide that obstacle, partly by depicting the SNP as ided, citing Alex Salmondrsquos latest initiative.More generally, an edict delivered by the PM would tend to reinforce the SNP message of external interference in Scotlandrsquos affairs. Douglas Ross knows that, especially in Holyrood elections, the voters want politicians to stand up for themselves and to stand up for Scotland.However, the Tories will say the best way to reinforce those Scottish interests is to use what they call the ldquobroad shoulders of the UK to rebuild the economy. Hence announcements such as the transition deal for North Sea oil.Labourrsquos new leader Anas Sarwar has three big challenges ahead. He too wants to thwart an overall SNP majority. But he wants to overhaul the Tories and regain second place.More generally, he wants to reverse a dismal Labour record. The party has slipped back in popular fortune at every Holyrood election since the very first in , when Donald Dewar entered coalition power.Mr Sarwar wants Labour to speak with a dferent tone. Less overtly aggressive and confrontational.

According to Professor Curtice, Mr Salmondrsquos sunny predictions of a pro-independence supermajority could turn to ashes on election day. Unless Albarsquos candidates secure a sufficient percentage of votes in the constituency lists their efforts may deprive the SNP of the handful of these they require to gain an overall majority.This of course, will rest on Mr Salmondrsquos personal popularity rather than on the attributes of Albarsquos other candidates. With every fresh vicissitude the former first minister of Scotlandrsquos sense of self-worth seems to swell. In similar circumstance most others would slink away, thankful simply to have survived the onslaught.Read more:Why on earth would Scotland want to be part of the EU anyway Of the other senior politicians only Anas Sarwar, new leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, responded with any measure of dignity. The rest, by degrees, exhibited many of the haughty and juvenile tendencies that have alienated so many rank-and-file voters. Nicola Sturgeon ndash now the primary target of her predecessorrsquos vengeance ndash couldnrsquot resist a pathetic dig at Mr Salmondrsquos perceived gambling habits. The partyrsquos Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, described Kenny MacAskill ndash the highest profile SNP defector to the new party ndash as ldquoan embarrassment.Mr Blackford, a nasty and vindictive politician, is still remembered across the political spectrum for the callous nature of his campaign against the tragic former Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy. Recently, he was forced to apologise for attempting to inflict mob justice on an innocent freelance photographer for breaching travel restrictions . At Westminster, Mr Blackford presided over meetings of his group which were barely-disguised, psychological ambushes to bring down his colleague, Joanna Cherry. One of these figures is indeed an embarrassment and itrsquos not Mr MacAskill.The nature of Mr Blackfordrsquos response encapsulates several of the reasons for Mr Salmondrsquos optimism. He and his senior colleagues have presided over the SNPrsquos transitioning from a party that exuded openness and bonhomie to one now characterised by authoritarianism and mind-control and built around the cult of their leader.Thus, the foot-soldiers of the wider Yes movement, those who turn up in all weathers to march under one banner for independence have lately felt a disdainful chill coming from those who gather around the SNP leadership. These people have felt betrayed and only too aware of how they are routinely portrayed by those using the Hate Crime Bill and gender theory to marginalise them. The suspicion persists among many of them that these ideological proclamations are convenient fig-leafs to cover the SNPrsquos failure to improve the le-chances of Scotlandrsquos poorest communities.Contempt for those who may be tempted to back Alba was apparent too in much of the media commentary. One writer dismissed all those thousands who have already pledged allegiance to the new party as ldquocranks, misfits and zoomers, these being the favoured slurs of middle-class commentators to dismiss anything they consider too rough to be worthy of actual engagement.Read more:Whats the SNPs problem with the working class Another idea thatrsquos taken root among the cafeacute politicos is that by playing more than one pro-independence team in the contest nationalists are ldquoGaming Democracy. Basically, this suggests that cornering the market in list seats as well as first-past-the-post ones is just not cricket, old boy, and undermines the spirit of the contest. Behave yourself.Democracy itself is the gaming of equality. Itrsquos how civilised, educated and opulent people mask the class-driven and unseen levers that still pull in their direction. You might think we exist in a state of one-person one-vote equality but the multi-billion-pound lobbying sector the adoption of neo-liberal power structures and the paths of least resistance always taken by politicians who promised to be radical indicate something . Boris Johnson dropped the pretence last week when he lauded the corporate \"greed\" thatrsquos apparently rescued us from the pandemic.The SNP leadershiprsquos fury at Mr Salmondrsquos re-emergence after hersquod been presumed permanently deleted should be viewed in the context of gravy trains being de-railed and comfortable lestyles jeopardised.

What unity  The parliamentary SNP has become a haven for preening, elitist performance artists while locking out working class people. It exists as a career opportunity for a cadre of mediocre middle-management types who gather to congratulate and affirm each other in issuing risk-free political emoluments. From time to time they pause, but only to abjure the thick proles for not being sophisticated enough to get on board with the progressiveness.We may all be entitled to take a certain view of Mr Salmondrsquos past conduct and his actual reasons for leading the Alba Party, but spare me the sanctimony and hypocrisy. Nicola Sturgeon, Ian Blackford and their parliamentary drones have fostered more ision in the SNP than anything that might be wrought by Mr Salmond.

You wonrsquot know just how fearful farmers are about this until you see the results of a devastating dog attack on livestock hellip it can be horric.With sunshine forecast across the country from Friday, the masses are gearing up for a great big green escape to the countryside. But therersquos a major change this spring and that has been the explosion of new dogs over the last year which are about to be unleashed for the first time.Glancing down at my familyrsquos rough-coated Jack Russell terrier gnawing loudly on a Nylabone chew at my feet, I realise what a salvation our furry canine friends have been during this dficult time but am equally struck by the enormity of responsibility which comes with owning a dog and the training involved.My hat goes off to new dog owners who have invested in online training classes over the last year, but in the coming weeks, for many, it will be the first time their dogs will be let off the lead in an open space ndash putting their recall training into practice. That open space is likely to be on farmland, and our fields are quickly filling up with new-born lambs as farmers and crofters embark on one of their busiest seasons of the year.  Right to roam is a wonderful thing, but with unfettered access to the countryside, comes the duty of responsible access. So, in short, keep your dog on a lead around livestock and be wary of ground nesting birds and other wildle.This might seem mind-numbingly obvious to most reading this column, but the fact is, there are more than . million households in the UK who have brought a new pet into their families since the start of this pandemic. This includes a lot of new dog owners who may not be aware of the devastating consequences their cute fluffy pet could have on new-born lambs.I will never stop reminding people about the fact that any dog has the capacity to chase, maim and kill livestock, as every day I am confronted with painful stories and devastating images of farmers who have suffered the horric consequences of an out-of-control dog savaging their sheep.This past week, South of Scotland MSP Emma Harper received unanimous support for a Bill which sought to toughen the penalties on offer to the courts when convicting irresponsible dog owners involved in livestock attacks. Now, guilty iniduals could serve up to  months in jail and or a fine of up to pound,. For years, farming organisations and the police have been running educational campaigns warning dog owners of the consequences loose dogs can have on livestock, but now this new Bill will add further weight and deterrence.Since I started my job with the Scottish Farmer in , I have supported Emma Harper with her proposals and have followed her journey as she met up with farmers across the country, listening to their concerns and promising to bring them justice, so I felt a huge rush of emotion on Wednesday night when this Bill was debated for the third and final time in Holyrood and will now proceed for royal assent before passing into law in six monthsrsquo time.This is a huge moment for Scottish farming and offers much hope for the future that these incidents are being recognised and will be dealt with more fairly. The whole industry is indebted to Emma Harper and her team who have campaigned unreservedly on this over the past four years and these tough new penalties will hopefully send a strong reminder to dog owners of what is at stake,their dog chases or kills livestock. Keeping your dog on a lead around livestock isnrsquot the only thing that should be a no-brainer, but so should picking up your dog poo. This isnrsquot just a responsibility reserved for walking on our beaches or our streets, but also in our fields.Neosporosis is one of the hidden diseases which can be carried in dog faeces and poses a serious risk to livestock and other dogs. More dogs are being infected by the parasite neospora as a result of the growing trend for feeding dogs raw meat. The parasite sheds eggs passing out in dogsrsquo poo andleft behind in a field, can remain infectious for up to six months. If consumed by cattle, in contaminated water, grass or in hay this disease can cause abortions and is responsible for more than  per cent of abortions in cattle.I spoke to a local farmer from Ayrshire this weekend who told me that  acres of one of his silage fields was so saturated by dog poo that he was unable to use it to feed his cattle this winter. He had to accept that  bales ndash equating to around pound, ndash had to be discarded. He told me that despite there being a woodland running alongside the field with a route for dog walkers, that the public preferred to walk through his field and were oblivious to what their dogs leave behind. He is rightfully worried, that from this Friday, the hordes are about to descend, and his field will be ruined once again, and his livestock put at risk.We all should exercise our right to enjoy our beautul countryside, but be mindful of whose workplace you are passing through, and afford it the same respect you would ask for in ."},{"url":null,"title":"send-clowns-short-story-nick-scobie","story":"SEND IN THE CLOWNS, BY NICK SCOBIEChief Inspector Aitken vowed as he left Ashfield Square that the next time he confronted one of Joe Smiths rallies he would ldquo crush him. The police had been heavily criticised on all the news channels for failing to keep order. He wanted revenge. At the Anti- Poverty Rally organised by community activist Joe, black-clad anarchists had suddenly appeared and sparked a mini-riot.Joe Smith had secured a job as a hospital porter in Chloes Hospital in addition to his usual job as a joiner so that he could spend extra time with Chloe. She was  years of age but had leukeumia. He knew and she knew that she was very ill. He had discovered that Chloe was able to analyse everyday political events. He felt he benefited from her views. She was confrontational and feisty ndash just like her mother.ldquoDaddy ndash why cant people protest peacefully  \" asked Chloe as Joe sat beside her on a visitor`s chair one night. ldquoWhy cant you take the clowns with you when you want to say what you think is wrong  People listen to clowns.\" Joe left the hospital ward and thought about what Chloe had said. He and his friends often dressed up as clowns to raise funds for Chloes ward.Joe thought long and hard about what Chloe had said. He had an ideahellip..ldquoMy Daddy is a clown ldquo said Chloe to the ward sister ndash Sarah Burt ndash a few days later. ldquoAnd he is going to help the working class. No-one is better than anyone . And my Daddy is a clown who is going to do something about it.\" Sister Burt sighed inwardly and thought to herself: ldquoWhat is this child talking about  \"On Saturday  November  history was made.  police officers sat in expectation of a ldquo ruck at Ashfield Square. Joe Smith had organised an Anti-Poverty Rally and thousands were expected to attend. A helicopter buzzed overhead, while the police support units were on standby. Chief Inspector Aitken could barely conceal his excitement. That toe rag Joe Smith was going to get his just desserts.Chief Inspector Aitken radioed over to his ldquospotter ldquo in plain clothes around  noon on the Saturday. The rally was due to start at pm. In Ashfield Square there were very few people about but the spotter Sergeant Combes, in plainclothes, had advised him that crowds were gathering at the Ashfield City Football Stadium, half a mile from Ashfield Square. He suspected that they were going to all rally there before marching down to the Square. An hour later he confirmed that there was a crowd of around  but that they appeared to be enjoying a pop and rock concert and a circus. ldquoA circus  \", queried Chief Inspector Aitken. ldquo Yes, Governor,\" replied Combes.The crowd in the Ashfield City Stadium enjoyed the music and the circus. The clowns were a particular favourite. Everyone was having a good time apart from  or so black-clad anarchists.Chief Inspector Aitken was getting more and more bemused as it was now .pm and there was no sign of the crowd moving out of the stadium. Then a minute later his radio crackled into le and Sergeant Combes said, ldquoFour Hells Angels on Harley-Davidsons have arrived in the stadium.\" Five minutes later Combes radioed in to say: ldquo The bikers are on their way to you Governor, but I think I should warn you about something.\" ldquoNot now, Combes,\" barked Aitken, ldquoI am in command mode now.\"The police surrounding Ashfield Square braced themselves ready for action as four Harley-Davidsons thundered into the Square itself. The bikes stopped and from the back of each one, a clown alighted carrying a case. The clowns waved off the bikers who promptly left the Square. The police watched in astonishment as the clowns slowly unpacked their cases and then set up a table and four chairs. Then they all sat down and set out tea cups, a tea pot and cakes. The clowns poured themselves tea and chatted away to each other.ldquoWhat do we do now, sir \" asked CI Aitkens second in command Inspector Brian Donnelly. ldquoWe wait,\" said Aitken confidently. ldquoObviously this is meant to lull us into a  sense of security. Smith and his rabble will be here enough soon enough.\" An hour later, Aitken was about to have a coronary. The huge crowd was still up in the Stadium peacefully enjoying themselves while he was facing a table load of four clowns drinking tea.Eventually he snapped. ldquoDonnelly ndash arrest those four\", he shouted. ldquoOn what charge sir \" queried Donnelly. ldquoClowning around,\" yelled Aitken. ldquoAnd wasting police timehellip.anything you can think ofhellipAs each clown was led away in handcuffs by about six officers each, they showed clearly to the waiting news cameras the slogan on their chests ndash ldquoChloes Clown Army Says No To PovertyldquoChloes Clown Army  \" asked John Butler, Sky duty news editor, as he watched the first pictures coming in of the events at Ashfield. His news crew had been sent up to report on a possibly hostile Anti-Poverty Rally, but it was not expected to be very newsworthy. Now he was intrigued. His reporter on the ground went up to the stadium and reported back to him.John Butler immediately ordered his Six OClock News Team to work on the background to the story. Meanwhile in Ashfield Central Police Station Joe Smith and his fellow three clowns sat in separate cells and slowly smiled to themselves. CI Aitken had been in to tell them that they were all in very hot water and he expected the CPS to throw the book at them. Which was not the view of his  junior officers as they went off duty wondering why they had been told to expect a riot that afternoon.ldquoCan I watch the news on television, Sister  \" asked Chloe at around . that afternoon. ldquoOh wel,lyou must Chloe,\" replied Sister Burt. The TV was switched over to Sky and at pm the main news came on. Sister Burt nearly had a canary when Chloe shrieked ldquo Thats my Daddy !\" Sister Burt turned to see a report coming in from Ashfield Stadium and Square. There were shots of the crowd in the stadium, clowns on motorbikes, clowns having tea in the Square and then finally clowns being arrested.As she listened in she heard interviews outlining the iniquities of poverty. Members of Joe Smiths committee outlined how they had been determined to have a peaceful rally, so had deliberately kept the main crowd entertained in the Stadiumand gone for a thought provoking, very quiet event in the Square. And then one spokesman delivered his main punchline. \"We cannot thank Chloe Smith enough for inspiring us to Send In The Clowns.\" Sister Burts face was a picture. ldquoI told you my Daddy was a clown, said Chloe proudly.Well ndash the story hit the internet and soon went viral. The pictures of riot police arresting four clowns having a tea party resonated around the world. Joe Smith and his three fellow clowns were released on the Sunday morning after the Home Secretary intervened and demanded to know from the Chief Constable of Ashfield whether it was his intention to make the British Police the laughing stock of the world. CI Aitken was put on immediate sick leavehellip.And as for Chloe   Well, as you read this she is still very ill in hospital, and only time will tell. But her request to her Daddy to ldquoSend In The Clowns\" has been vindicated.JUDGES COMMENT: Very good and topical too.

She probably saw more of him than his we.Mr Salmonds response to the character issue has been: show not tell. Albas -strong candidates list today has a majority of women. It includes two leading feminist SNP defectors: Dumbarton councillor Caroline McAllister, and North Lanarkshire councillor, Lynne Anderson. They were recently elected as the SNPs Womens Convener and Equalities Convener respectively. Anyway you look at it, that is a remarkable coup.Read more: Hating Boris isnrsquot enough ndash this election will be dficult for the SNPThey were also signatories of the Womens Pledge on sex-based rights. Ms Sturgeons forthright promotion of trans self-ID may play well on Twitter, but many older feminists are profoundly opposed. Most voters find the idea of men becoming biologically female mystying at best. The SNP is keen to keep this policy under wraps until after the election.Gender overlaps with an age class ide that has opened up in the nationalist movement. Mr Salmonds appeal is very much to older working-class supporters of independence, rather than the managerialist elite who dominate Ms Sturgeons inner circle. Mr Salmond would have willingly led those massive independence marches in . Ms Sturgeon preferred to march with middle class Remainers in London, rather than the uncouth crowd in Edinburgh with their motorbikes and Wallace kitsch.At an Edinburgh Book Festival event, Ms Sturgeon even suggested changing the name of the SNP because she didnt like being tainted with the N-word. She hates being called a ldquonationalist. Mr Salmond accepts it. It is what it is. He still accepts the recruitment of boxer Alex Arthur, who is a star in Scotlands housing estates, but only known on social media for his offensive remarks about Romanians.The SNP and many commentators have portrayed Mr Salmond as a right-wing, Nigel Farage-style populist leading a rag bag of racists and misfits. And truth be told, there is something of the Brexit Party in Alba. It is a nationalist party that has come from nowhere and is built around the personality of an insurgent, populist leader.The big dference is that Mr Salmond remains avowedly pro-European.Mind you, Alba doesnt seem to have settled policy on Europe. It thinks Ms Sturgeon has failed to recognise that SNP policy is redundant post-Brexit. Since Britain left the EU, the SNP has tried to pretend that nothing has changed, that the borderless  prospectus still applies. Yet everything has, and Alba is right to call out this pretence.There will obviously be a hard border with Englandand when Scotland leaves the UK and joins the European Union. More precisely, there will be a trade and regulatory ide, since the pre-existing UK Common Travel Area will mean passports and visas are unnecessary after independence. Alba sees this as an issue that has to be addressed. Though in opening this Pandoras Box, Mr Salmond could end up with more than he bargained for.A lot of SNP supporters, and Alba fellow travellers, are distinctly unenthusiastic about rejoining the European Union, and not just because of Ursula von der Leyens threats to start a vaccines trade war. There has long been a eurosceptic strand in the SNP. Many on the left favour the Norway option of joining the single market but not the political institutions of Brussels. The SNP has tried to keep a lid on this debate too, but not for much longer.Read more: Scots may loathe him, but Boris doesnrsquot give a damn about Plan BMr Salmond has also called Nicola Sturgeons bluff about a Scottish independence referendum being imminent, delivered by a new Section  order from Westminster. That is simply not going to happen. It is fancul to believe that Boris Johnson is going to risk breaking up the UK just because the SNP wins a majority in Holyrood. He will simply keep saying that now is not the time for indyref, as Britain emerges from Brexit. Sir Keir Starmer will back him to the hilt. Mind you, there is equally no guarantee that Mr Johnson would recognise an SNP-Alba supermajority. He might just echo Ms Sturgeon saying it is ldquocheating.However, this argument that having a pro-independence party standing for list seats alone is somehow undemocratic, or ldquogaming the system as Ms Sturgeon puts it, is simply wrong. The Scottish Green Party is a pro-independence party which is also standing only in list seats. As the Times reported earlier this month, the SNP leadership has been in discussions with Patrick Harvie about a formal Green-SNP coalition and even used the term ldquosupermajority to refer to their combined electoral strength.From the point of view of an ordinary SNP supporter, voting Alba for list seats is a no-lose proposition. Older working-class voters will likely see Alba as preferable to the ldquowoke Greens, whose policy on transgender issues is so controversial that their star MSP, Andy Wightman, had to leave the party because he wasnt permitted to speak about it. At any rate, SNP voters will have to be given better reasons not to vote Alba than that Mr Salmond is a bad man and that standing on the list is cheating. Ms Sturgeon may have forgotten, but only a few years ago the Scottish National Party renamed itself ldquoAlex Salmond for First Minister on list ballot papers.This man is a huge part of SNP folk memory. The attempt to write him out of history, like a nationalist Trotsky, was never going to succeed. Rather than attacking him personally Mr Sturgeon would be better advised to stay silent. Let the electoral system do its work and see what the voters deliver. After all, she is still vastly more popular among Scottish voters than Mr Salmond.

The drip, drip, drip of information about the views of iniduals either joining, supporting or running for Alba of late has been nauseating. One candidate made shameful comments about ldquobeggars, Romanians, HIV, and vaccines. Another called Nicola Sturgeon ldquoa cow. Itrsquos clear why many in Alba get slightly antsy at the idea of a clampdown on hate.:Salmondrsquos Trumpian circus distracts Scotland from the issues which matterWe already know Alba has the support of convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan, and includes some of the most reactionary voices from the SNP now within its ranks, including defecting MP Neal Hanvey, once suspended for using anti-semitic language. Nor can it be overlooked that when it comes to Alex Salmond, as Sturgeon has said, there are ldquosignicant questions about the appropriateness of histo public office given the concerns that have been raised about his behaviour previously.Sturgeon also says shersquoll refuse to have any dealings with Salmond as hersquos not shown any ldquosign of acknowledging how people feel about how he behaved while he was First Minister. Alba has already been dubbed, somewhat grotesquely, ldquothe Sleepy Cuddle Party. Creepiness abounds.The catalogue of unpleasant stories about Alba is too long for the purposes of this column, but put simply, this isnrsquot a basket of deplorables, itrsquos a whole supermarket trolley full. Yet perhaps the most galling of all Albarsquos antics is the fact that some of its supporters not only have a history of peddling the most disgusting, intimidating hate in Scotland, they continue to do so despite Salmond vowing at the launch of the party that its campaigning would be ldquoentirely positive.Hersquos clearly wrong. To pile duplicity on top of hypocrisy and offence, there are many voices across the Yes movement ndash mostly the older, more socially conservative wing ndash who persist in their ldquoWheesht for indy nonsense despite the truth about Alba staring them in the face.The sheer audacity is breath-taking. I donrsquot speak for the SNP ndash far from it ndash but Alba supporters have monstered the SNP, and in particular Sturgeon, endlessly for month upon month. They, and others, now want the SNP to play nice  Grow up.Itrsquos said that attacking Alba undermines the cause of independence. What have todayrsquos Alba supporters been doing for years now  Attacking everyone in sight. If theyrsquod learned to persuade instead of hate after , support for independence would be well beyond %, one imagines.Itrsquos downright gaslighting, which is no surprise really given the party in question and some of its supportersrsquo attitudes to women. These are the same people who claim Sturgeon is entirely to blame for the rise of Alba and should cosy up to Salmond. Get your head around that oneyou can without tripping over the word lsquomisogynyrsquo.But forget the SNP. There are much bigger questions around this Wheesht for Indy gang and their negative effect on the Yes movement.Whatrsquos the purpose of politics  Clearly to win people to your side. How on Earth are any soft, moderate, undecided voters going to be won over by a movement too sleekit to call out whatrsquos wrong within its own ranks Among the conspiratorial, paranoid wing of the Yes movement therersquos a fondness for the slightly menacing phrase ldquowe see you when they think therersquos some ldquotraitor, ldquoplant or ldquoquisling around. Well, be sure, the Scottish people see what this Wheesht for Indy crowd is up to: theyrsquore trying to hide dirt under the carpet. It looks crafty, manipulative, and amoral. Theyrsquore passively accepting the unacceptable because it suits their political ends. There can be nothing more damaging to independence. Be honest and yoursquoll win respect and votes.Unionists, understandably, look on this spectacle with glee. The Yes movement is tearing itself apart, in whatrsquos essentially a culture war between progressive social democrats in the SNP and Greens, and the agglomeration of Albarsquos alt-nat and alt-right voices, riddled with conspiracy theories, disinformation and paranoia. The Holyrood election is now mired in the madness that Alba brought in its wake. The vote in May, which should be about policy, has become a circus. On the issue of independence, sane voices are crowded out by extremists. And yet the Wheesht for Indy mob seem to be okay with this. Theyrsquore either politically immature or on the road to radicalisation themselves. This can only benefit the No supporting parties.If the behaviour of Alba figures isnrsquot strongly called out, itrsquoll send Scotland on a dangerous path. We cannot simply stumble into a place where we normalise the attitudes and behaviour this party represents. It masquerades as left-wing, for instance, while acting as a vehicle for some deeply reactionary characters.The defence of boxer Alex Arthur ndash whorsquos standing for the party and made some appalling comments online ndash is a case in point. Wersquore told hersquos just a working class lad and thatrsquos how working class people act. As someone from the working class, unlike many phonies who claim to speak for ordinary folk, let me be clear: this isnrsquot how working class people typically behave, and saying so is about as left as Enoch Powell.The American right normalised the antics of Trump and the lunatics who jumped on board his iteration of Republicanism. They did so because it was politically expedient. Look where that led and what that did. It ended up eating them alive. Thatrsquos what will happen here unless people have the gumption and decency to simply say what they see in front of them.:The Yes movement has been corrupted by hate and conspiracyIndependence is meaningless unless it builds a better Scotland.

Sarah Smith introduced the Alba Party for some reason, wasting important inclusion from the audience and allowed Douglas Ross to bully other participants when speaking.Today listening to Good Morning Scotland on Radio Scotlandthe BBC appeared to indicate it has become the pro-Union voice. Reporters and news segments continually repeated the \"another independence referendum\" rhetoric at every opportunity. If the number of times the debate participants and GMS presenters mentioned independence is counted it would prove the BBC participation in Unionist messaging, restricting debate on other topics. Why have a political debate when the BBC reporters and presenters are doing the job of the unionist parties  Why are they not similarly holding the unionist parties to account  Why are we not hearing of the parties vision for a future prosperous Scotland  That is what voters want to hear.Anti-independence voices are being given an unfair amount of time to make their case there should be a balance. If the BBC is facilitating the debate to be about independence then both sides should be given equal time to make their arguments.Christine Smith, Troon.* HAVING just watched the leaders debate, I have come to recognise how just how important the issue of a referendum on Scottish independence is in the world of Scottish unionist politics.While the programmersquos questions covered a range of issues, it was the prospect of a referendum that was given overwhelming importance, as Douglas Rossrsquos repeated references made clear. Without it he would have had to explain Conservative policies on climate change, the economy, education, condemning abusive attacks on MSPs et al. Thankfully for him, the partyrsquos obsession with a second independence referendum got him out of having to do so.TJ Dowds, Cumbernauld.* THE first Scottish leaders debate was rather a dull affair, presented by the unionist BBC featuring questions mostly about indyref. Only the women stood out, with a spirited performance from Lorna Slater and a controlled and competent one from Nicola Sturgeon. Douglas Ross was a disaster with his endless diatribe against independence, which Anas Sarwar and Willie Rennie tried to counter. As to the question of Union or independence, facts and figures may be discussed, but with conflicting views, littered with deceit and lies, a fair conclusion is dficult.However one question is now clear. If a supposedly highly-subsidised Scotland is such a burden to the UK, why is Westminster so desperate to keep us in the Union  The answer is that apparently poor, wee Scotland holds the majority of the UKs energy resources, including lucrative food and drink exports and has the talent and ability to manage all.Indeed Scotland is certainly \"big enough, rich enough and smart enough\" to prosper as a fully independent country again and make no mistake, Westminster is very well aware of this as they would miss our financial contribution massively.Grant Frazer, Newtonmore.* NICOLA Sturgeons below-par performance at the leaders debate was promulgated by two factors. Fourteen years of the SNP in power leaves little wriggle room to cover up all the mistakes, and independence is definitely not the flavour of the month. Alex Salmonds intervention has been the final straw in what was already going to be a hard policy to sell.The public are genuinely fed up with stre. They are getting enough of it from nature without some politicians adding to it. This election could yet prove to be a bridge too far for those seeking independence.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.AUSTERITY ON BOOSTERS BECKONSTHANK you for your coverage of the Institute for Fiscal Studies report on Scotlands public expenditure , especially in the light of the approaching election.It comes as a timely reminder that every time Nicola Sturgeon opens her mouth to brag of past achievements or to commit to new expenditure, voters should remember that much of it would be impossible without revenues redistributed from better-off parts of the UK. Furthermore, in Mondays leaders debate, Ms Sturgeon pledged the SNP to Scotlands rejoining the EU in the next five years. Not only does this require a referendum on independence within the sort of reckless timescale favoured by Ian Blackford, but it would demand that Scotlands public expenditure is permanently slashed to meet the requirements of the EU Stability and Growth Pact.When these are added together, it is clear that to vote for the SNP is to wave goodbye to the devolution goodies and to say hello to austerity on boosters.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.DONT BLAME IT ALL ON STURGEONI THOUGHT Jim Sillarss roots were somewhere in Ayrshire and not Mars .Is he not aware that there is another independence-supporting party which has been successfully garnering list seats and, while supporting independence, has proven to be no patsy for the SNP  I refer, of course to the Greens.Nicola Sturgeon was right to dismiss the idea of an SNP ldquoreserves party being formed to capture the list vote and ldquogame the system. Does Mr Sillars take the electorate for mugs  They would have seen this for the cynical ploy it would have been and, I suspect, many soft independence voters would have been repulsed by this anti-democratic gerrymandering.I am under no illusions that it is ldquoSaint Nicola who leads the SNP but when will this group of predominantly white, middle-agedmen stop blaming the current situation on her and face up to the fact thatit were not for the inappropriate behaviour of their leader we would not be in this situation and would be striding forward to independence, dignity intact Itrsquos not proud Edwardrsquos army that needs to be sent homeward to think again. Itrsquos Eckrsquos battalion who need to get a flea in their ear.William Thomson, Denny.HONEST APPROACH WILL WIN OUTI AM sad to say that the respect in which I held Jim Sillars has been somewhat tarnished over recent years, however, I was unprepared for his rather seedy suggestion that Nicola Sturgeon should have agreed to the establishing of a \"separate but linked list independence party\" which would have had \"some degree of SNP control\" basically, a pop-up party designed to beat the Holyrood system.Ms Sturgeon has stated that \"weve got to win independence fair and square. We cant game or cheat our way to that\". I think that the First Ministers straight talking and honest approach will be the one which will resonate with the voters in May.Ruth Marr, Stirling.* I DONrsquoT want Jim Sillars to shut up, heaven forfend, Scottish politics has been very much poorer since he faded into the background, but I do wish he would put up. Despite Ian Blackfordrsquos childish remark, a jibe that was more suited to himself, Alba already has a very able, established voice in Kenny MacAskill, butMr Sillars committed himself to the new party it would add greatly to its standing.Meg Henderson, Montrose.WHY ARE THERE NO PROXY VOTES I HAVE two grown-up sons currently working abroad.They recently asked me to contact the Electoral Registration Office in Glasgow, to arrange a proxy vote for them in the forthcoming Scottish election. Both are registered to vote in Scotland.I contacted the office and was informed that UK citizens living in Scotland had no right to a proxy vote in Scottish elections. This right only applies in Westminster elections.Like many others, I recently received the Scottish Governmentrsquos pamphlet, entitled ldquoYour Scottish Parliament election voting guide. On Page  it states: \"British citizens living overseas canrsquot vote in the Scottish Parliament election.Notwithstanding this exclusion, there are a number of other groups who are allowed to vote, including, again on Page , \"a qualied foreign national who has permission to enter or remain in the UK, or who does not need such permission\".It is my submission that those who, like my two sons, are working abroad, have retained their UK domicile. However, for whatever reason, they have been disenfranchised by being denied their right to set up a proxy vote.Historically people have always had to fight hard for the right to vote. It is to be hoped that whichever party forms the government after the May election will rescind such discriminatory legislation as a matter of urgency.Kathryn A Carroll, Glasgow.Read more: Sturgeon only has herself to blame for arrival of Alba"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-letting-youngsters-learn-play-age-seven-bring-great-benefits","story":"During the postponement of full-time education owing to the pandemic over the last year, there was plenty of time to recalibrate our countrys education system to restore its credibility.

It is evidently not sufficient to presume that staff in general hospitals will have specialist infectious disease training nor that these hospitals will be suitable for treating rampant infections.Whatever, this pandemic has shown up the weakness in our current NHS system and the need to urgently review how infectious diseases are treated and contained.This must include facilities separated from our unsuitable existing general hospitalsboth staff and patients are to be kept safe.Elizabeth Marshall, Edinburgh.LETS LOSE THE REALISMDAVID Clarkaskshe is alone in deploring the lack of speech clarity arising from the adoption by broadcast media of \"realistic\" dialogue in place of the clear \"stage speech\" which used to allow viewers to follow the plot without dficulty.

Most radio output I now also switch off because of the muttering and the present use of those higher-pitched \"little girl\" voices that presenters announcers actors, and the other females who inhabit the radio waves have to use, so over to Radio  I go where music does not \"mutter\".

This figure, alongside the fact that the upcoming Holyrood elections are taking place during a global pandemic - where door-to-door campaigning is limited - means that social media is going to be a key battleground in the run up to May .:Could Alex Salmond get seats in Holyrood Even in elections that took place before the pandemic, political parties that had the most effective social media campaigns have gone on to electoral victory. From Obamarsquos groundbreaking use of online advertising and voter mobilisation in , through to the cutting simplicity of the Tories lsquoGet Brexit Donersquo digital messaging in , via of course Trumprsquos lsquoMake America Great Againrsquo memes in , it is clear that social media matters in determining who wins on election day.As we are yet to see any polling that includes the Alba party, and given that social media shapes elections, we can turn to social media engagement figures to give us a preliminary sense of how much support Alex Salmondrsquos party has.In the space of a week Alba has amassed a following of just over , Twitter followers, but on Facebook they have only gained a following of  people. These do not seem like the levels of support needed for a party to have electoral success.Data from CrowdTangle, a public insights tool owned and operated by Facebook.Indeed, the small social media following is surely a disappointment for a party that is led by a former First Minister, ran by a former SNP digital strategist, and has the support of several controversial yet supposedly popular pro-independence bloggers.By using the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle we can see the Facebook interactions that Alba has gained over the past week, and again the numbers will be disappointing for anyone who is under the illusion that Alba represents a large grassroots movement.Alba only has a daily average of  Facebook interactions .

Last month, the council’s interim chief executive offered an unreserved apology after an investigation found that the order had failed to adhere to procurement policies.But in a true twist of fate, the authority#s calamity could now generate more than its weight in stone for the local economy, according to archaeologists.#This is a very rare and unique find,# said Dr Avril Foulis, an archaeological consultant from the Friends of Orkney Lithology Society.#The figurine is in near-perfect condition, despite being approximately , years old, and having travelled the -mile journey to Orkney within the stone shipment.#This could present a breakthrough opportunity for Orkney archaeologists and the tourism industry alike. If we take the right steps, it could bring in millions of pounds in academic funding as well as additional footfall from visitors. This could be just the post-pandemic boost Orkney needs.#Dr Foulis and her colleagues believe the find could be just the first of many to come.#We have assembled a team to examine and oversee the remainder of the stone which is being shipped from Oban,# she continued.#If there are any more discoveries to be made, we hope to be able to unearth them with little dficulty or disruption to the work at Cursiter Quarry.#We have been lucky to get the use of a fleet of wheelie bins in order for us to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak.#While it has been assumed the figurine will remain in Orkney, authorities in Oban have already made representations for it to be ed to its place of origin.Kirkwall East councillor John Ross Scott was quick to defend OIC#s position, and suggested that plans may be afoot for a permanent visitor attraction, to be built on the Cursiter Quarry household Waste and recycling centre .In the meantime, a temporary portacabin has been sourced to house the figurine, he says.#The stone is legally ours, and we paid handsomely for it, so therefore the figurine is ours too,# he said.#I went out to visit the site, last night, as soon as I found out about the discovery. I wasn#t able to get in to see it, but I look forward to sharing photos of it on Facebook at the earliest opportunity.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Just today we have heard from Nova Innovation that they are now powering electric cars in Shetland directly from tidal energy, a clear sign of the potential for direct benefits in the immediate future.“These things are all happening and the industry is on the up, but without the final leg up from government – whether in Contracts for Dference or other fiscal support – then someone  will step in.#This is a chance for high-value jobs to be created across the UK and particularly in island communities, rather than importing technology that we could be leading on here.“The need for commercialisation support will only go away when that need is fulfilled, whether it is by the UK or others. With COP [the  United Nations Climate Change Conference] rapidly approaching, it is an opportunity for us to make a statement on a major green technology for the future – it is time to commit.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon.

Not a disaster by any means, particularly in this part of the world, but my own lowest tally ever, as usually I’m looking at somewhere around the  to  per cent mark.I suspect an underlying issue with fluke at tupping time. Fasciola hepaticais a tiny mud snail which is ingested through grazing and attacks the liver. It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

You could say she was pursuing the romantic Celtic dream, but with Father Allan and the people of Eriskay she found it, and it was no more a dream than was she herself.We should be immensely grateful to her. Her style of writing may seem slightly arch to some today, but none other than Padraic Colum was happy to write the foreword to her book, full of praise for her writing skills.She was a kind of predecessor of Margaret Fay Shaw, that most redoubtable of ladies, made of Pittsburgh steel, chain-smoking and with a bourbon to hand and her beloved piano just across the room.

Daniel Kane found herself in Malawi - the fth poorest nation in the world. Malawi, with a population of almost million and only a handful of ventilators and very little PPE, was totally unprepared for the pandemic. Charlotte assisted in the initial response to the first surge of the coronavirus as it spread throughout Malawi. Currently, however, a second and more deadly wave is gripping the country with devastating consequences. Charlotte said: “There are ten times more cases than during the first wave and a projected exponential increase in the infection rate. “Access to hospitals and modern health care is extremely limited. Many covid- patients are being treated in temporary wards in carparks with oxygen cylinders and . “There is no ability to give patients ventilatory support and take them into intensive care. Frontline healthcare workers risk their lives every day without adequate PPE and basic essentials such as hand gel.”Another huge contrast with the UK is that it may be some time before poorer countries like Malawi can get the vaccine. Here in the UK, the vaccine rollout has been a massive success with every person eligible for a free vaccination on the NHS. In poorer countries it will take much longer even for the vaccine to reach frontline health workers and the most vulnerable. The “Economist” reckons that it will be  at least before there is widespread vaccine roll out. “This means that Malawians have at least two years to get through before there is effective vaccine cover. As the vaccine rolls out in advanced economies and many of us are starting to see a glimmer of hope that normality willsoon, the story in Malawi couldn’t be more dferent,” says Charlotte.For health systems which are already woefully under-resourced, dealing with a second wave and a new strain of COVID- is a monumental challenge. Hospitals and clinics are operating without the basics to protect their staff and patients. Basic levels of PPE and hand gels are in very short supply. Without this support fragile health systems will be decimated of their most precious resource at this time – healthcare workers as many are at home sick with COVID- or sadly dying. This comes at a time when hospitals are buckling under pressure and desperately need health workers to be able to work.Charlotte now works as a doctor in Liverpool where the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has launched Bump It Forward campaign to help bring PPE and vaccines to Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe in an attempt to redress this massive health inequality. The fund raising campaign actually came about as the result of a dream.A Christian friend of Prof Melita Gordon, who works in Malawi fulltime as part of the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, dreamt about how she was to receive her vaccine free of charge and an idea emerged to ‘pay forwar’d the cost of that doseage to help people in countries who did not yet have vaccines. It was a very direct, personal idea that people in the UK who have had a vaccine get it for free while the people in Malawi don’t. People love the idea of the BumpitForward campaign as it provides the opportunity to give back the cost of the vaccine in the order of pound. which they get it for free to help protect healthcare workers in Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe until the vaccine reaches them and save lives.Dr. Kane says she would love to see a local response to the campaign after her experience at the Mulanje District Hospital.Charlotte says: “The hospital is doing a great job, providing quality, safe and dignied care in extremely dficult circumstances.“Just like in the UK, they have had staff shortages related to staff testing positive for COVID which has made things all the more dficult. The senior nurses have designed a protocol to make best use of reusable gowns and are very grateful to receive the PPE donation. “I worked at Mulanje for the first six months of  and they have been brilliantly supportive partners in MLW-led research into reducing deaths from sepsis and HIV associated TB, so it is a pleasure to be able to support our partners when they are in need of PPE at this time. #Bumpitforward is a wonderful campaign which I couldn’t recommend highly enough.Give the equivalent of your Covid- vaccine to protect frontline staff in African countries who will have to wait for theirs. You can help keep them safe by donating the equivalent cost of your vaccine, to protect them until they can get theirs. There has already been a huge response to the Bump It Forward campaign and it continues to grow! It has now raised over pound,.

Q: Can I take part in physical activity with others A: Up to  people — including children — from a maximum of two households can now take part in outdoor sports activities.Outdoor sports facilities can reopen but only to permit their use for those allowed in the health regulations.You can play again at your local golf club, have a game of tennis or go for a walk or run with friends over Easter.Club houses must remain closed under the Covid- restrictions, apart from essential toilet facilities. Car-sharing, sporting celebrations and any congregation of people watching sporting events should still be avoided.Q: Is there anything I can do to safely celebrate Easter with my loved ones A: Despite the Covid regulations in place there are still many ways we can celebrate the holiday either in person or online.With the easing of regulations in private gardens, you could host an Easter egg hunt for the children in your family or have an egg and spoon race.Many people enjoy painting eggs or making an Easter-themed wreath.Why not host a Zoom party and do those activities together with your friends and loved ones or do it yourself and give them as a gt Many churches across Northern Ireland will also be hosting an online service to mark Easter Sunday.Q: When will the restrictions ease further and what does that mean for me A: On Monday, April , Northern Ireland will take another step out of lockdown. Training for up to  people from sports clubs will be able take place outdoors, contactless click and collect will be permitted for all non-essential retail, and up to  people from two households can meet in private gardens.The Executive’s next formal review of the restrictions will take place on or before Thursday, April .Belfast Most ReadUTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases as Bobby Storey funeral dominates discussion in Assembly and Policing BoardFormer IRA men Arthurs and Quinn facing prosecution over Francie McNally funeral Rev Ian Paisley won political battle with republicans, Bernadette Devlin McAliskey tells UTV#s Face to FaceVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionLatest CoronavirusHealth experts say fresh surge unlikely due to vaccine successCovid enforcing shouldn#t have been the PSNI#s job, says police unionGolfers hit the fairways to heaven as courses reopenFionola MeredithOpinionPPS call on Storey funeral shows what#s wrong with NIUlster Unionist Party join calls for PSNI chief constable to resignLatest from Belfast UN condemns violence against Myanmar protesters and deathsYouTube beauty star James Charles admits messaging underage boysPolice issue warnings ahead of further Kill the Bill protestsWhat the papers say – April Ministers warned against introducing domestic vaccine passports,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Merchant Square is an indication of what Belfast can achieve.”Noel Lander, director at JLL, said: “The landmark sale of Merchant Square demonstrates the investor appetite for best in class regional offices with secure income streams and strong environmental, social and corporate governancecredentials.”Oakland was advised by JLL, AL Goodbody and KPMG. The purchaser was advised by SPS Investment, King  Spalding International LLP, TLT LLP and BDO LLP.Speaking to the Belfastearlier this year, Kevin MacAllister, PwC Northern Ireland regional market lead, said its move into the new offices — expected later this year — coincided with a new era in work. “Undoubtedly the world of working and how we deliver professional services will change, but it’s not either or, office or home working. We’ll be into a much more blended, flexible working regime.“We’ve been developing it quite closely with our people, and quite a signicant part of the floor space will be a wellbeing area. We’ll be providing things like onsite healthcare with GP services, yoga classes — anything that has a wellbeing angle to it.”He added: “We’re trying to bridge the gap between home and office and sort of blur the lines a little bit, so you make an office an extension of home.”The NI Civil Service has said it’s consulting with trade unions on a future remote working policy for its staff of ,.Belfast Most ReadUTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases as Bobby Storey funeral dominates discussion in Assembly and Policing BoardFormer IRA men Arthurs and Quinn facing prosecution over Francie McNally funeral Rev Ian Paisley won political battle with republicans, Bernadette Devlin McAliskey tells UTV#s Face to FaceVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFirst Minister calls SF actions ‘above the law’ and says police abdicated responsibility before, during and since Storey funeral PlayDrone shows amazing Co Down mill propertyLatest Northern IrelandHealth experts say fresh surge unlikely due to vaccine successCovid enforcing shouldn#t have been the PSNI#s job, says police unionGolfers hit the fairways to heaven as courses reopenUUP joins calls for PSNI Chief Constable to resignUlster Unionist Party join calls for PSNI chief constable to resignLatest from Belfast YouTube beauty star James Charles admits messaging underage boysPolice issue warnings ahead of further Kill the Bill protestsWhat the papers say – April Ministers warned against introducing domestic vaccine passportsForeign holiday hotspots ‘will be graded using traffic light system’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Headed by matriarch Katherine, played by Amanda Burton, the clan was infiltrated by Marcella , who went undercover as Keira Devlin.Series location manager Chris Myers said Larchfield House was ideal for the shoot as it was large enough to suggest the status of our story#s resident family but not so daunting in scale as to be unimaginable as a home.While the family#s dark behaviours might have shocked many viewers, it seems the beauty of the area still appealed.Coming in at fourth place in the top  of drama locations that have helped spark a property boom is ITV police drama The Bay, written by Co Armagh man Daragh Carville.Property prices in the coastal Lancashire town of Morecambe rose by .% - a jump of % on nearby Scale Hall.

Dunlop saw an increase of .% in property prices in , more than double that of nearby East Kilbride.Other locations to make the list include Beaconsfield for Afterle, Sutton Hoo for The Dig, and Richmond-upon-Thames for Bridgerton, which saw prices rise by .% to an average of £,.Miles Robinson of Trussle said: The last year has seen a big sht in homeowner priorities.Searches for properties in small towns and villages doubled as city dwellers opted for countryside living.Increased time spent indoors led to one in seven adults considering a move to a home with more space and it seems our favourite TV programmes are inspiring us too, becoming much more than an #escape from reality#.Drama locations influenced property hikes before the pandemic too. Shows such as Poldark and Doc Martin saw more people want to relocate to Cornwall, while the Broadchurch effect resulted in property prices shooting up in West Bay, Dorset.Belfast Most ReadUTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases as Bobby Storey funeral dominates discussion in Assembly and Policing BoardFormer IRA men Arthurs and Quinn facing prosecution over Francie McNally funeral Video: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionRev Ian Paisley won political battle with republicans, Bernadette Devlin McAliskey tells UTV#s Face to FaceTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFirst Minister calls SF actions ‘above the law’ and says police abdicated responsibility before, during and since Storey funeral PlayDrone shows amazing Co Down mill propertyLatest Northern IrelandHealth experts say fresh surge unlikely due to vaccine successCovid enforcing shouldn#t have been the PSNI#s job, says police unionGolfers hit the fairways to heaven as courses reopenUUP joins calls for PSNI Chief Constable to resignUlster Unionist Party join calls for PSNI chief constable to resignLatest from Belfast What the papers say – April Ministers warned against introducing domestic vaccine passportsForeign holiday hotspots ‘will be graded using traffic light system’Health experts say fresh surge unlikely due to vaccine successShannon Murphy: Male directors face stfer competition from women for work,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The two men helped plan and lead an IRA escape from the Maze Prison in the s. He is highly unlikely to apologise publicly for being at the funeral.The North Belfast MLA represents the older guard of the party. It is his job to keep the republican base on board, leaving the diplomacy in times of crisis to the newer wing of Sinn Fein.The party is in a tricky position, balancing the anger of those who sacriced family funerals because of the Covid restrictions with not being seen to be subservient to the demands of the DUP.Ahead of the Easter break, when republicans commemorate their dead, sackcloth and ashes apologies will not play out well with their base.What does this mean for the DUP, which needs to be seen as tough on Sinn Fein or face further criticism from Jim Allister, who has the party chasing him around for the working-class loyalist vote Mr Allister said earlier this week that all unionist politicians should walk away from the Policing Board in protest at the decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to attendance at the funeral. Not so long ago, this would have been viewed as a radical suggestion, but his calls appear to be gaining traction with DUP Junior Minister Gordon Lyons, who told the BBC the party was considering its position on the oversight body.Walking away from public bodies may make a statement in the short term, but where does that leave unionism#s long-term strategy going forward,those whose resignations it has called for simply choose to ride out the storm The criticism of the Chief Constable, allegations of two-tier policing and questioning the motivation of the PSNI at a time of loyalist unrest is a very dangerous game for the DUP to be playing.With tensions around the sea border and loyalists in some areas withdrawing cooperation with police on community bodies, any ramping up of tensions could be used as cover by those hell-bent on taking opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol onto the streets.The announcement by the PPS on Wednesday that the decision on the Storey funeral was to be reviewed by independent counsel may well buy some time for unionists to revise their strategy.Meanwhile, on what should have been a quiet holiday week, the Executive is facing yet another political crisis, leaving many askingthe devolved government is fit for purpose.Belfast Most ReadUTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases as Bobby Storey funeral dominates discussion in Assembly and Policing BoardFormer IRA men Arthurs and Quinn facing prosecution over Francie McNally funeral Rev Ian Paisley won political battle with republicans, Bernadette Devlin McAliskey tells UTV#s Face to FaceVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayFirst Minister calls SF actions ‘above the law’ and says police abdicated responsibility before, during and since Storey funeral PlayDrone shows amazing Co Down mill propertyLatest Northern IrelandHealth experts say fresh surge unlikely due to vaccine successCovid enforcing shouldn#t have been the PSNI#s job, says police unionGolfers hit the fairways to heaven as courses reopenUUP joins calls for PSNI Chief Constable to resignUlster Unionist Party join calls for PSNI chief constable to resignLatest from Belfast What the papers say – April Ministers warned against introducing domestic vaccine passportsForeign holiday hotspots ‘will be graded using traffic light system’Health experts say fresh surge unlikely due to vaccine successShannon Murphy: Male directors face stfer competition from women for work,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is not the first time that the double naming of our hometown has been a source of confusion but the mind boggles as to how this mistake was not realised sooner in the process. “I have called on NISRA to resolve this issue, however in the interim I would advise anyone contacted about non-compliance to explain the situation which can then be recorded on the Census system.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Well, a Derry girl has torn up the rule book and thrown it away after tying the knot in a dream wedding in one of the worlds most stunning locations. After a three-year engagement, Aoibheann Gillespie-Mules recently married long term partner, Raffy Casinares, on the island of Negros Oriental in the Philippines, where she has been living and working for the past seven years. Following the ceremony, the happy couple, who both work for Marine Conservation Philippines, wasted no time in sealing their match-up with a loving kiss during a e in the warm waters surrounding the island, something Aoibheann was very comfortable with, seeing that she is a master e instructor. googletag.cmd.push However, due to coronavirus restrictions, the -year-olds family were unable to attend the ceremony. She, Raffy, the Mayor of Negros Oriental and two friends work colleagues were the only ones in attendance.  Aoibheanns mother, Daisy, said she wasnt disappointed at not getting to attend the wedding. She said: “She told me via What’s App about getting married. We’ve always used the internet a lot, to keep in touch. I was delighted. They’d been thinking about it quite a bit and trying to work out where, the Philippines or here , so it wasn’t a big surprise. “Neither wanted a ‘classic wedding. Aoibheann felt that would have been very stressful and expensive. They wanted something simple just for them. Her Derry friends organised a mad ‘hen-Zoom’ party the week before which was wonderful and it allowed friends from all over the world to participate. I lasted a couple of hours but it went on for several. googletag.cmd.push “They were married by their local Mayor. I don’t think I would have gonethere had been no Covid as they wanted it just for them. “There was no live link, she What’s Apped me with photos soon after. I was sleeping. They got married at .am which was .am. in Derry.” So, the big question is... what does Daisy think of her new son-in-law  She said: “Raffy is wonderful - a very gentle, quiet, hard working man, who adores her and is a very calming influence on her, too. “He’s visited Ireland twice over the past years and went to Australia with Aoibheann to celebrate my th in December  – he had never been out of the Philippines until he met Aoibheann.     “They are now about to embark on a new adventure. Unfortunately, there’s little work in the Philippines, due to Covid, so  they’re soon coming to Ireland, with their dog, Conan, as Aoibheann has been offered a job in Waterville, Kerry, starting in May. “I’m delighted, even though it’s at the other end of Ireland, at least it’s on the same land mass as me.”Daisy conceded she was apprehensive when Aoibheann first went to Bali as she was travelling alone, but was happy as she was following her dream. Daisy added: “She was pretty grounded so I trusted she’d be OK. As a parent I reckoned my role was to help my wee’uns gain their wings. So, of course, they’re going to fly. “Her elder sister, Kate, is  years older. She went to Australia after uni, so maybe she had an example there. Her brother, is a marine biologist in Scotland.” Daisy said Aoibheann first took to water when she was just eight months old when she into the sea in a safe bay in South West Donegal where she is originally from. Daisy added: “She swam with City of Derry, was on their swim team and competed a lot with them during her primary schooland then when at Oakgrove Integrated College. “Her big sister, Kate, lives on the Gold Coast, Australia, so when Aoibheann was eight, we and her brother Ruadhaacuten, who was  at the time, visited her The highlight for Aoibheann was snorkelling on the Great Barrier reef from Cairns.” Daisy said Aoibheann first got the ing bug while attending the National University of Ireland in Galway where she graduated with a Marine Science Degree She added: “She went to Mozambique one summer to tag whale sharks on a volunteer programme, set up by the university as she had to learn how to e. From then on, her dream was to e more. “When she graduated she headed to Bali to do her Dive Masters training. She then found a e instructors’ programme on Phuket, Thailand, that she liked and so trained there to be an Instructor. She stayed there for a few months, after completing the training, to teach and to learn more from her trainers. “She came home in the Spring of , worked in Peadar’s while she thought what next  That September she got a job in El Nido, on Palawan, Philippines, as a e Instructor working for Submariner Diving Centre. She met Raffy there, who was also working for SDC. Three years later they decided to look for something dferent so they were offered jobs with Marine Conservation Philippineson the island of Negros Oriental. There, she trained the volunteers who came to work for MCP. They had  at any one time from all over the world living with the staff at their base. “As well as working on Conservation. She upped her skills - qualied as a master e instructor, worked as a Green Fins assessor, got a Tec e qualication, too. She developed her photography skills and set up her own website.”The last time Daisy saw all her children was during a visit to Kate in December . “Ruadhaacuten, came, too, with his partner Helen. He’s a marine biologist who works for Marine Scotland. They are hoping to get married in Scotland this coming June, after two postponements due to Covid.” So, Daisy would appear to be faced with a dilemna – does she buy a hat or a ing suit!  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Redcastle hotel is located in the once proud and independent peninsula of Inishowen. The last of the Irish chieftains with whom this site is associated was Cahir ODoherty. Cahir became chieftain at the age of  in , after the death of his father, Sir John O Doherty. In order to secure his position, Cahir changed his family’s side in the Nine Year War year and swore loyalty to Queen Elizabeth, because of Inishowens important strategic location and the defeat of the Confederates at Kinsale in . googletag.cmd.push The war ended in . It resulted in the Flight of the Earls from Rathmullan in  and the Plantation of Ulster. Cahir thought his reward for his help and loyalty would be great. But apart from being knighted and acquiring the title Sir, he was to be disappointed. In frustration the -year-old chieftain rebelled in , sacking the English held city of Derry and burning it to the ground. He was killed shortly after this in the Battle of Kilmacrennan, just outside Letterkenny. Because of this rebellion King James I ordered the great walls of Derry to be built. After Cahir, the last Inishowen Chieftain, was killed, all his lands in Inishowen were seized by the James I for plantation and ided between The Established church and Arthur Chichester. The two separate entities that were then Inishowen and Tyrconnell were joined and made into one county. It was named Donegal. googletag.cmd.push The first house built on the site of the Redcastle hotel was built by the Carey family. The Cary family were landlords who received plantation lands from Moville to Muff. The family lived here from about  to , almost exactly  years. Unfortunately for the Careys, they had money problems and eventually were forced to sell the Redcastle house and Estate in . Thomas Doherty from Muff purchased the house from the Careys, but because of legal issues it took  years for them to complete the sale. The most famous of the Careys was Joyce Carey. Joyce Cary was listed in the top  writers in English by The Sunday Times. Some of his books were made into film. His son and grandson continued in the creative theme and were involved in TV series such as Dr Who and Captain Pugwash.     Thomas Doherty left the estate to his youngest daughter, Jane, who was married to Dr Richard Doherty, a lecturer in midwery in Queens University, Galway. Dr Richard Doherty died in  and his we Jane in . Richard converted to Catholicism late in his le and left the Redcastle estate to his daughter, Elizabeth and her husband Captain Ernest Cochrane, on the condition that the children be brought up as Catholics. The year before Elizabeth died she was in dispute with the local land league on the reduction of rents. Armed men were employed to secure her crops after locals refused to harvest them. They were unsuccessful at getting the crops harvested, but it is said they did get through quite an amount of Jameson whiskey and food. Captain Ernest Cochrane was the son of the famous and notorious Lord Thomas Cochrane, on which the films Master and Commander and Hornblower are based. Earnests famous bloodline does not end there as he is also a descendent of Robert the Bruce who actually invaded and occupied Northburg Castle in Greencastle for a short period. True love must have been very much in the air as the condition that Richard Doherty left for marriage and inheritance at this time would have been quite a diplomatic feat, given that Earnest was also the high sherf of Donegal. But they managed it. Captain Cochrane went to church in his Model T car. Reg number Hand Elizabeth and her children in their horse and carriage to Drung Chapel. To this day they are still separated, Earnest in a grand monument grave in front of the now derelict Church of Ireland Church in Redcastle. Elizabeth Francis with her children and her parents are interred at the alter area of the old Catholic Church, Drung. After the ious land acts that were introduced after , landlordism went into terminal decline. Lands were sold off and the large houses were either left to rot away or knocked down to avoid taxes on them. Redcastle House survived. Captain Earnest Cochrane died in  and Elizabeth Francis in . The Cochranes remained and turned their hand to farming and in the s opened the Redcastle House as an Hotel. The Cochranes sold Redcastle in  and the hotel is now once again back in the ownership of a Doherty.

There is not a girl woman anywhere who doesnt like a piece of jewellery or an aromatic fragrance. You could include a few men in that, too! Among them are two young Derry girls who love all things glittery and sparkly – and a nice fragrance – so much so, they have used their time during Covid- lockdown to start up their own fragrance business. Sisters Mia, , and Bella Doherty, , from Cornshell Fields in the Ballyarnett of the city, named their enterprise Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella- a combination of their names – and after almost a year of research, trials and checking out regulations, they have their enterprise up and running. googletag.cmd.push At the minute, they are making wax melts of ious fragrances and shapes along with room sprays to match the wax melts smells. They are also currently looking into other products as well. Mia, who attends St Marys College, said they began researching soon after the Covid- restrictions were introduced in March last year. She added: “We undertook online courses in candle-making tohelp our wee idea become a reality. “We tried out dferenttypes of soya wax andfragrances with our family being thetesters, much to their delight for a goodfew months. “We wanted to be % happywith our product before we decidedthey were ready for purchase.So the launch of Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella began last month. googletag.cmd.push “We are both currentlyusing our mum’s kitchen but she doesn’tmind as we clean up after ourselves and her house always smells solovely for her. “Also, by law, we have to follow certain regulations, so have to ensure CIP labels are made for every fragranceoil and then bepresently packaged. This can all take a lot of timebut we really love being creative and by adding glitter and colour and trying out dferent designs makes our wax melts stand out compared to others.Having nice packaging and how they are presented is very important to us “We make wax melts by melting soya wax and adding fragrancesoils and pour into moulds, although this sounds very straight forwardthere is temperature taking anda few step-by-step instructions that need to be adhered toin order to maintain a good quality product that will last.”     Despite the success and the enjoyment of making fragrances, Mia said she was looking forward to going back to school. “St Mary’sis a fantastic school and I love getting up to go to school every morning.” She admitted she was a bit concerned about how much catching up she will have to do but said she was sure the teachers would put everyone at ease when they were all back in the classroom. “We definitely missed schoola lot,especiallynot seeing our friends was dficult but starting this business has helpedkeep us occupied and easeanyboredom. “Learning our craft and keeping upwithschoolwork has made the wholeCovidsituation fly in for us. Weare so busy at the minutewith orders for delivery that our mum had to help out as well. She is able to help at the minute as her business is currently closed due toCovid- restric- tions.She was a great help at the start as she was able to guide us in the right direction - we have even roped dad into helping by doing the deliveries.” She added: “I hope we go back to normality as I like the hands on physical activities at school like technology and science experiments.” Bella, who ed to P at Steelstown Primary School on Monday last, said despite the enjoying of producing Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella products, school work was her priority. “I was a bit nervous about ingto school but it was great. I have a new teacher and she is really lovely. It was great seeing all my friends as well. This is my last year in primary school so I am really happy to be getting backto see everyone before I have to make the transition to secondary school.” Bella said they had been inundated with very positive reviews for their range of products. “Everyone seems to love the product going by the lovely messages we receive.Customers wish us every success andfor more orders so this makes us very happy. “When we are back at school full-time and not able to commitour time as much to the business as school is the priority, my aunties are willing to help out to keep us well stocked up with our products. “The people in our cityand beyondhave been really supportive inshopping local, it feels good to know we’re doing something right.” The girls mother, Maria, is understandably so proud of her two girls, being the owner of Miabella beauty salon next to the car wash on Racecourse Road in Shantallow which has been closed for nine months of the past year. She said: “If there’s one thing I can take from lockdownis that I work too much and the girls missed me, so spending quality time and helping them out with their wax melts was amazing. I’ve learned so much from them and how much of a work ethicis instilled into them, “I am so proud of them both andhow they have juggled both school work and their newly established business. “They both are managing perfectly so farand I can go back to work and know they are perfectly capable of staying on top of orders. “As their mum, though, I will keep on top of the social mediato ensure their safety - their page is linked to my phone so I can keep them safe.” Maria conceded she has found lockdown extremely dficultat times. She added: “I really miss my clients, as a lot of them have become friends over the years. It’s always good to catch up with each other.I’m so looking forward to seeing each and every single one of them when I canalthough trying to fit everyone in will prove to be a dficult task. “Somehow, I’ll man- ageshould I work night and day to get you all beautied again.I don’t like to disappoint anyone when they look for appointments, my clients are lovely and are very understanding.” So Chanel, Jimmy Choo and Gucci, take note of the name - Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey announced earlier today that she has agreed that the Fort George site can be the location of a new health centre. The site is owned by the Department for Communitieswho is leading on its regeneration. There has been many years of debate over what the prominent riverside should be used for. However, to date, only a large office block has been built on the land. After an Expression of Interest exercise, DfC entered an agreement with the Western Health and Social Care Trustso that they could further develop their proposal for the health and care centre to be located on the site. googletag.cmd.push Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said: “Fort George is a strategic regeneration site that has huge potential to create real social and economic benefits for the City of Derry and beyond. “I am delighted to announce that I have agreed to provide part of the site to the Western Health and Social Care Trust for their Health and Care Centre. My Department is committed to maximising Fort George’s potential and is delighted to work with the Trust to accommodate this ambitious development which will deliver key health services to the community in Derry.” The department says that the development of a Cityside Health and Care Centre is anticipated to create  new permanent jobs as well as centralising approximately  posts in a modern state of the art facility. googletag.cmd.push The positions will include nursing, social work, allied health professional and administrative roles as well as the relocation of a number of GP surgeries. However, SDLP Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan has expressed reservations about the proposal for the Fort George site. “While it would be foolish not to see the merit in a new health hub, particularly in the current climate, Fort George is perhaps not the most suitable location, said Mr Durkan. “People will no doubt see this announcement as falling short of earlier proposals, promises and plans. In short, it could be deemed a reduction in terms of ambition.     I am of the opinion that this strategically important development site would be better utilised for something that adds real value economically to the city and beyond. “However, that being said, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing our health service pre-pandemic. A system already at breaking point has struggled under the weight of the past year- this state-of-the-art facility will I hope, take pressure off that system and ensure the effective delivery of integrated health services for the surrounding areas. The creation of  permanent jobs is also good news, particularly in conjunction with the transfer of Health Sciences to Magee University, which I hope will encourage more students to train and remain.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The shutting of the outlet at Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre is one of  stores earmarked for closure across Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England. The companys other store in the city at Foyleside Shopping Centre on the cityside is to remain open. The closures have been prompted by ongoing challenges to high street trading, which have been exacerbated by the Covid- pandemic. Semichem, which is owned by community retailer Scotmid Co-operative, said it was in talks with landlords in several locations and would make a final decision on a small number of the  stores in the coming months. googletag.cmd.push A total of  Semichem staff have now entered a formal consultation process. Management at Scotmid Co-operative, owners of Semichem, said they were exploring opportunities to redeploy as many as possible within its wider business. Karen Scott, head of Semichem, said: “The high street was already struggling to adapt to the pace of change in shopping habits, including out-of-town developments and the rise of internet shopping. That change has undoubtedly been accelerated by the Covid- pandemic. Sadly, we have reached the point where it is no longer viable to keep some of our stores open. “We are grateful for both Scotmid and subsequent government sup- port, which has undoubtedly prolonged the le of many stores. Our priority now is to support affected colleagues at this dficult time. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Many of the pieces have been dedicated to inidual key workers in the city as a thank-you for all their tireless efforts throughout the pandemic. Recent visitors to Foyleside Shopping Centre will definitely feel that Spring is in the air with the installation of the colourful handiwork which is aptly entitled ‘New Beginnings’. Beautul bunnies and charming chicks are just some of the cute characters featured in the vibrant craft masterpieces together with an assortment of intricately stitched throws guaranteed to bring smiles to the faces of visitors of all ages. googletag.cmd.push  The seasonal installation will reach an audience of millions after award-winning local production company, AlleycatsTV, produced a short film in celebration of the women whose devotion to crochet has helped them overcome the challenges of lockdown. The queen of crochet is Margaret Crabtree who has been teaching the craft for almost three decades after volunteering for a fundraiser at her daughter’s nursery school in the s. Coming from a family of crafters, Margaret now loves to share her expertise and see other women thrive with their new-found skills. Through her business, ‘Keep Her Knit’, she teaches more than a dozen classes in Derry city as well as in Counties Derry, Tyrone and Donegal. googletag.cmd.push Classes have moved online during lockdown, providing a leline for her students, many of whom are older and or living alone. Margaret said: “We wanted to do something to show that we’re together, even though we’re apart. The crochet groups I take are like a family. I’ve been taking classes by Zoom during the pandemic, but we all really miss the social aspect of meeting up. “Working on the ‘New Beginnings’ pieces gave us something to focus on and it’s fantastic to see them all up in Foyleside, they are a mix of ability levels and some of them are real masterpieces but it’s so good for everyone’s self-esteem, regardless of the level.     “All the ladies in my groups keep saying to one another, ‘what would we have done all daywe hadn’t been crocheting ’ so it’s good to know that it’s helped them get through the boredom and isolation of the lockdowns. They are a real community, stitching the city together the skill level is phenomenal and a tribute to our heritage of sewing which is in the genes and it’s just great to be able to showcase it. I’m always striving to bring these talents to a wider audience.” The project was funded by Bluebell Arts Derry through the Department for Communities. Two of Margarets students, Mary Walsh and Theresa McSwiney, are both interviewed for tonight’s programme. Niamh Minihan from AlleycatsTV said: “I have been aware of the fantastic talent amongst the Keep Her Knit members for a long time. Some of my own family love to crochet and have been taught by Margaret Crabtree. It has been a real pleasure for me to direct this film and shine a light on such a positive story for our city. Alleycats are a Derry-based company and we are passionate about telling stories from our hometown.” Fergal Rafferty, Manager of Foyleside Shopping Centre, is delighted to see its spacious mall transformed for Spring. He said: “Foyleside always loves to support and showcase the skills of local people and the communities we serve. The New Beginnings display is really eye-catching, the level of talent in our city is remarkable and the colours and theme will be so uplting for all of our valued customers and staff coming into the Centre over Easter. We have no doubt that viewers of ‘The One Show’ will love it just as much as we do too.” Tune in to ‘The One Show’ on BBC One this evening, March , at pm, to see Margaret, Theresa and Mary from the Gasyard classes and Foyleside in all its Easter glory!  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new study highlights that the Peace Bridge and the bringing of Protestant cultural events to the cityside has had an evident impact on cross-city mobility. googletag.cmd.push The new report was launched on Monday. Speaking during a discussion to mark the launch, Mr Middleton welcomed the new report and said initiatives such as the construction of the Peace Bridge and the  City of Culture celebrations had helped make the local Protestant community feel more welcome in the city. “Thatplayed a huge role in getting people across to ious events right across the city where they felt, you know what, it doesnt matterI am Protestant or Catholic or whatever background I come from I can feel part of this and I am welcome,” he said.     Mr Middleton praised ongoing cross-community projects but said it was important that they had an impact and were not just tokenism. “There needs to be a feeling thatwe are going to be involved in this, then there is going to be a genuine partnership, it is not tick box exercise. We want a lasting legacy from some of the projects we are going to be involved in.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson also spoke at this weeks event and said there were some very positives from the new report. She also praised the cross-community work of local groups and said that efforts must continue to make people from a Protestant background feel welcome in the local area. “As someone who had felt that I was born into a state that did not want me or welcome me, I do not want people in the Protestant unionist loyalist community that they are in a city which doesnt want them or welcome them,” she said. “The fact that the research has said that a signicant number of them feel that they are not wanted or that they feel that the other community wants them to leave. “I certainly do not want people from the Protestant unionist loyalist community to leave. “I think the research is a great foundation stone on which we can build to outreach and engage respectfully and have conversations going forward,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is the daunting schedule facing Connor Coyle next week as he steps into the ring for the first time in  months. The Derry middleweight will fly to Mexico for the equivalent of a long weekend as he aims to get his professional career back on track in . The -year-old, who is -, has not been in action since January last year when he defeated Miguel Dumas, and he is eager to get going once again. On April th, he will step into the ring in Chihuahua, Mexico against hometown boxer Esteban Villalba , after a break of  days due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push It has been a long, long wait for Coyle, who has never stopped training in the hope that he would get the phone call for his next fight. “I didn’t think I would have been out this long. I’m just happy that there’s now something in front of me,” he said. “It’s completely dferent when you have a focus. I haven’t stopped training since my last fight but you push yourself to a dferent level when you have a fight in front of you. You feel a massive dference in the gym when you now you have a focus, especially trying to get your weight down. googletag.cmd.push “You need that motivation and that hunger to be training for something. The excitement is there and I have a lot more energy because I am pushing myself for something, rather than just ticking over and training to keep myself in shape. Because I haven’t stopped from my previous fight, that helped keep the momentum up whenever I really had to put the head down.”  Daunting Schedule There is no doubting that Coyle faces a dficult schedule next week. He has very little time to adapt to the change in setting, with what plans to be a hectic few days, with just two days in Mexico before he steps into the ring.      “I’ve never done this before,” he admitted. “I know when I travel to Florida I arrive at night time and sleep that night so I’m up fresh the next morning to go training. This is basically going to be the same thing. I’m flying over at night-time so when I get over I’ll be able to get some rest and get up and weigh in and rest again until the fight. I don’t think I’ll have any problems because it’s straight over and back. I’ll probably feel it coming back because it will catch up with me but on the way over I think I’ll be okay.” Villalba will be Coyle’s third Mexican opponent in succession, but despite a rather inconsistent record, the Derry man is expecting this particular Mexican to be on a dferent level. “I don’t know too much about him but I know he’s a tough operator and he’s very, very durable,” he explained. “We’re fighting in his home town so he’ll have no travelling to do, he’ll get up out of his bed and go and weigh in, or go and fight or whatever. He’ll be well rested. “All Mexicans are tough operators so I’ll be going into the lion’s den in this one and I’ll be expecting hard rounds, so hopefully we can get him out of there early. My last two opponents were Mexican, but this guy takes it to another level. He’ll be tougher.” Ultimately, the goal for Coyle is to get back to America, with this fight seen as something of a warm up for the real action when he gets back to the States. “They are making it very dficult with the travelling and the restrictions so I’m going to try and make the most of it when I go where and stay for a few fights,” he stated. poundIf all goes well and I go over in August or September, I’ll possibly stay until Christmas time and get in as many fights as I can until then.” Sponsors Connor would like to thank the following sponsors for their continued support, especially during such a dficult time. They are: Thirsty Goat, Celebrity Slots, Classique Floor Designs, Central Site Development, Doire Designs, The Bentley Bar, Conor Curleys Cars, Frankie Ramseys, Brooklands Fencing, Archibald Construction, RB Tiling Services, Pauls Butchers and Olympus Fitness. He would also like to give a huge thanks St. Josephs Boxing Coach Cahir Duffy for the last  weeks of training as well as Strength and Conditioning coach Kyle Wallace.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Since , the local authority has been progressing with plans to restore the natural and built heritage of the forest park with several key stakeholders including Forest Service.The councilrsquos vision is to create a heritage-led destination which protects the heritage of Castlewellan Forest Park for future generations, whilst also providing opportunities for local people and visitors to learn more about the landscape.The lsquoRe-rooting our past in the Future: Castlewellan Historic Demesnersquo project will connect people with the built and natural heritage within the forest park, as well as restore and celebrate its unique bioersity.This includes the restoration of a living arboretum, containing some of the most signicant collection of trees and shrubs on the island of Ireland.As part of the project, the Grange will be developed into a visitor core with the creation of a welcome centre, community space and cafeacute facilities, with the Courtyards transformed into a vibrant visitor hub and dedicated centre for community use with interpretation, activities, events, environmental education and skills development.In addition, the landscape will be conserved and managed sensitively, protecting its plant collection and important bioersity.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said the flagship project has been designed to deliver the local authorityrsquos vision of transforming the picturesque forest park into a ldquodynamic, heritage-led destination, restoring, celebrating and interpreting the natural and built heritage of the historic demesne.And she paid tribute to members of a task-board that has supported the development of the project since .ldquoI live in Castlewellan and have been on the task-board from day one and am delighted that the council has received this financial support,she said. ldquoI look forward to the delivery of the project as it will generate local economic, social and environmental benefits.As the former demesne of the Annesley family, the forest park is steeped in natural and built heritage dating back to s.The park is an integral part of the Castlewellan community and provides locals and visitors with recreational space for outdoor activities such as, cycling, horse riding, fishing on the lake, canoeing and orienteering.At the heart of the park is the arboretum and walled Annesley Garden, the latter which provides a central focal point for the National Arboretum with the pound.m investment package designed to re-establish the historical nature of the planting in the arboretum.The Heritage Fundrsquos Northern Ireland Director, Paul Mullan, said landscapes and nature ldquoform the bedrock of our culture and heritage, improving wellbeing, sparking curiosity, and protecting and providing for the communities surrounding and inhabiting them.He continued: ldquoNational Lottery players have highlighted natural heritage as especially important, which is why we are proud to award Newry, Mourne and Down Council a grant to create a heritage-led destination at Castlewellan Historic Demesne.ldquoThe Heritage Fund is incredibly proud to be playing a role in ensuring our natural heritage is safeguarded for generations to come, but also that the projects we fund give people the chance to connect with the nature that is on their doorsteps.Council officials say it is widely acknowledged that parks and open spaces play a hugely important role in supporting local communities, both in terms of providing recreational space, but also for supporting health and wellbeing.They add: ldquoAs we move towards recovery from Covid, the implementation of this project is timely and will benefit the citizens of the district through reconnecting people with their heritage, community and nature creating a safe, vibrant welcoming park for all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-50.jpg","title":"50 not out as Jeff clocks half century at Dundrum  ","story":"JEFF Maguirersquos love affair with cricket started  years ago.The Dundrum Cricket Club stalwart says itrsquos a love story which ranks second only to that with his family.Jeff says he is proud of the journey which has blessed him with friendships for le. These affinities were formed all across the globe, from as far away as India, Sri Lanka, Australia and across the island of Ireland.ldquoItrsquos hard to believe that I am  years going to the Meadow at Dundrum Cricket Club and I still get a buzz when going through the new gates, says Jeff.ldquoI can still remember playing in the winning side in the Downshire Cup final at the best new ground in the Northern Cricket Union at Strangford Road in Downpatrick.Jeffrsquos Dundrum side defeated Downpatrick Cricket Club, with his brother Noel scoring  odd to defeat a strong home side that featured superb players, including Alfie Linehan, Noel Ferguson and Jim Patterson, who all played for Ireland, Alfiersquos brother, Hugh, who Jeff believes should have been capped, and superb all rounder Brian Ferris.Jeff reminisces fondly of that game. ldquoI got to play in front of a decent crowd alongside two of the best club players our village ever produced, one being my brother Noel and the other being Alan Neill. I remember going to bed a little tipsy, the true version would not be believed long before the snowflake culture.Jeff proudly captained the first team for seven seasons, winning back-to-back McGready Cup finals at Dundrum after beating North West Cricket Union teams Bonds Glen and The Nedd.ldquoBoth games had a fantastic atmosphere. They brought a full  seater bus packed with refreshments and both teams stayed long into the night at the Bay Inn as they enjoyed the village hospitality.However, there were hard times for Dundrum as Jeff recalls a second arson attack against the club  years ago.ldquoIt simply showed the fighting character of the committee and members. I wrote lots of begging letters and phone calls for help, he recalled.ldquoI got a massive shock when I received a cheque made out to myself for pound, from the Foundation of Sports and Arts. I give special thanks to former Australian player James Burston for his input.The club received a further pound, from Down District Council and used local firm Seamus Walsh and Sons to build the excellent present pavilion at the cost of pound,, signying the start of rebuilding the club in every aspect.Paying homage to the clubrsquos ground staff who Jeff calls ldquothe real stalwarts, he gives praise to Tommy Curlett , who has looked after the square for over  years. Over the last decade, Tommyrsquos brother, Jack, has also been assisting, with Jeff mentioning Jack as ldquoone of the clubrsquos best ever all rounders.Jeff also applauded two more Curlett brothers, Bobby and Jim, who built the superb new electric score box free of charge.Also earning praise is new treasurer Stephen Calvert, who Jeff describes as the ldquodriving force behind the scenes, displaying fantastic forward thinking and planning everything down to the last detail.He continued: ldquoStephen now prepares the wickets, and I have never seen a harder worker in my le. From clearing the banks to planting the hedges and securing grants, he is a very tight treasurer that all clubs need.Not only a celebrated player, it is clear that Jeff has became an influential figure at the Dundrum club.Twelve years ago the club backed his request to employ the first of many successful overseas coaches, Sri Lankan Manoj Fernando.ldquoIt is the main reason the club isthriving, he said. ldquoThe junior section has been very successful with six of the players now playing for the first team and many more playing for the seconds and thirds.ldquoThe juniors have been on tour to Scotland three times, whilst also going to Telford. There is another good crop of kids coming through.Alongside his achievements on the field, Jeff nods kindly to the accolade he received in  when he was presented with the Jim McMorran Waterford Crystal Bowl for voluntary services to cricket from the Northern Cricket Union.ldquoFor my th birthday, I ran a fundraising soft ball fun match and barbecue, which raised pound, towards new set covers. I will remember as much due to the coverage legendary reporter David Holmes gave me on social media.All good things must come to an end as Jeff recalls two operations in  which forced his thoughts on retirement.Jeff decided to run a fundraiser inviting players from dferent clubs to attend. ldquoAs a thank you to a sport that has given me something that money could never buy, I ran two T games with refreshments and a raffle. I could not believe we raised pound, towards a new electric scorebox.ldquoIt was a very emotional day for me as I wandered around the ground with my grandson James. I was amazed at the decent crowd as I bowled the first ball and walked off to enjoy the day. But deep down, it hurt that I could not play.Jeff will be holding his last ever fundraiser this July, with the money going towards new enclosed two bay practice nets. He is set to organise two T games with added barbecue and refreshments as a final swansong to his beloved cricket.ldquoThe game of cricket has been a massive part of my le,  not out and burn the whites declared Jeff.He does, however, look eagerly ahead to the new season, which is planned to start the first week in May.ldquoItrsquos a testament to all the hard work at the club that it can now field three senior teams, with captain James Martin leading a very decent side for the new season. They can, no doubt, be very competitive.Looking to the future, he added: ldquoThe club is also excited about new coach Dan Kearsley, who begins his position after Easter and will be at Shimna Integrated College every Thursday.ldquoThe club is committed to attracting new young boys and girls to the great game of cricket..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Conor.jpg","title":"Conor keeps in contention for number one position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK goalkeeper Conor Hazard gave a very impressive display on his Windsor Park debut for Northern Ireland on Sunday evening.Hazard made a number of fine saves throughout the friendly match, but was unable to stop his side losing -

Itrsquos a point that anglers disagree with.DERA explained the work on the banks of the river created two dedicated disabled parking spaces in the car park where previously there had been none and that it is not satisfactory for disabled anglers to make their way to access current angling facilities located away from the car park.A spokesman for Downpatrick anglers said they are pleased that consideration is now being given to providing two new dedicated disabled fishing stands.ldquoWe welcome DAERArsquos confirmation that officials are also keen to meet with us to discuss our concerns which is an important step forward, he said.ldquoThe fact that the rights of disabled anglers at the Quoile River are now being recognised is also a welcome step forward. Redeveloping the car park and providing disabled parking spaces but no area for those with mobility issues to fish from was an error which now looks as though it is going to be rectied.The spokesman said he hopes that DAERA will also inform Newry, Mourne and Down Council about the plan to now provide disabled fishing stands at the riverbank car park.ldquoWe would hope councillors are informed via email or letter so there is a record of the commitment to carry out this work, he said.ldquoMoving forward, we believe that there is a need for DAERA and the Environment Agency to join forces to develop a training programme for their respective staff on how to handle the needs of disabled anglers in particular.The spokesman said lessons need to be learned from the Quoile River debacle and hopes that everyone involved can now move forward in partnership.ldquoDisabled anglers have been stopped coming to the river to fish for over a year since work to redevelop the car park got underway. Had the needs of disabled anglers been uppermost in the minds of government officials at the planning stage, it would not have taken  months to reach the point we are now thankfully at, he said.ldquoEveryone associated with Downpatrick Anglers is looking forward to seeing the new fishing stands in place soon and the welcomeof disabled anglers. They are part and parcel of the fishing community and must enjoy equal rights when it comes to their support.The spokesman added: ldquoAs we have always said, fishing is very therapeutic and we would strongly argue that the provision of new disabled angling stands on the banks of the Quoile should be a priority and will be of tremendous benefit..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Shirley.jpg","title":"Fountain Foodbank thanks public for help in lockdown  ","story":"THE Fountain Foodbank is continuing with its vital role in supporting families across the district.A year after going into lockdown, the cross-community organisation based in Downpatrick mdash staffed by committed volunteers mdash continues to meet a pressing need.In its latest newsletter, the foodbank says it continues to be extremely well supported by local people and organisations and that every penny it receives makes a dference.Shirley Lennon, the foodbankrsquos co-ordinator, has revealed that decisions regarding how the organisation could operate during a global pandemic had to be made quickly to deal with the evolving situation and continually revised as time moved on.She explained that initially, the foodbank operated a lsquodrive-thrursquo service which soon had to be replaced with a delivery service for the first period of lockdown.ldquoWe were grateful to many younger people who helped with both the packing and delivery of these parcels.

These workers are not using buses or cars and it is good financially that they donrsquot have to pay for car parking or fuel. And for Downpatrick, there will be dozens more people on the streets in the town, bring lots of benefits.Mr McGrath also acknowledged that the move towards regional hubs could result in empty office space in and around Belfast where a huge number of civl servants were traditionally based.ldquoThatrsquos the challenge mdash to repurpose those buildings mdash but we certainly cannot have vacant government buildings in the city centre being held on to for five,  or  years, he continued.The local MLA also believes that moving civil servants away from Belfast could provide an economic spin-offs for towns like Downpatrick.He added: ldquoIrsquom a fan of decentralisation in the public sector. It guarantees footfall in regional towns and that brings fairness to the rate and taxpayer. They get the benefits of having a workforce near them, especially the hospitality and retail businesses.ldquoIf you have  or  civil servants there they will spend a certain amount of money every week in those businesses while the city centre has a dferent product it can sell to attract those people at weekends.Developing Rathkeltair House as a regional jobs hub has been welcomed by a number of

eight pumps, convenience shop with deli counter, canopy and underground storage tanks.The proposal also features three electric vehicle charging points, car parking for  vehicles, a jet wash, play area, landscaping and site and access works.Planning papers confirm that the site will be accessed off the Magheraknock Road with the proposed development offering over  car parking spaces, four of which will be reserved for disabled drivers and another two for mothers and toddlers.The papers say that due to the ldquomodest scale of the development and low numbers of cars generated, it is not anticipated that the development will have any detrimental impact on noise and air quality of the surrounding environment.Planning permission for a filling station, shop and car wash was previously granted for the development site in , with the planning papers outlining the proposed play area will be located at the south western boundary of the site and lead to a new pedestrian connection from the site to an existing footpath along the Ballynahinch Road.This has been designed to allow children within surrounding residential developments to use the play equipment.The planning papers say previous planning permission for  square metres of retail space is insufficient to meet the needs of the local neighbourhood which is devoid of local retail provision.ldquoThe application represents

Integrated Collegersquos new poundm campus in the autumn.Local planners have given the green light for the construction of the new -student school in Newcastle andit is hoped that building work will be completed in .The modern new three-storey school will be constructed to the east of the current main building at its sprawling Lawnfield site at King Street which will eventually be bulldozed.Included in the ambitious development plan are a range of new sports facilities which we will be shared with the Newcastle community.The new school proposal is being supported by the Department for Education and Integrated Education Fund with principal, Kevin Lambe, delighted that formal planning approval will be rubber-stamped by local councillors next week.Mr Lambe says the entire Shimna community is delighted that planning permission will go ahead for ldquoour wonderful new building.He said everyone was ldquoextremely excited that work on the new school will begin in the autumn term and that the new Year  students joining Shimna this September will be able to look forward to sitting their GCSEs and A levels in a purpose built, state-of-the art building.ldquoOf course, we have always been very proud of our current, semi-permanent building, which was begun in  mdash financed by parents on a bank loan mdash and which has grown with us through  years, Mr Lambe continued.ldquoIt will, in many ways, be a sad day to see that building come down. However, important though excellent facilities are, the core of a school is the student, staff, parent and governor body and they deserve a new building to match the commitment, enthusiasm and of course the Integrated ethos which drives this school.Mr Lambe thanked the Department of Education and the technical team behind the new school for the energy and creativity they have brought to the project.He also extended gratitude to Newry, Mourne and Down Council for addressing the schoolrsquos application for planning permission.Mr Lambe added: ldquoWe are particularly excited that the sports facilities for the new school will be shared with our local community and all the community partners who already meet in Shimna.Shimna College currently shares its sports halls, grounds and main building with a number of local groups and in  celebrated its th anniversary with its need for new accommodation one of a number of projects earmarked for financial support in the Fresh Start Agreement.The hugely successful integrated college opened in September  with just  pupils, but has since grown to become of Northern Irelandrsquos leading schools.However, the current school does not meet its needs or the standards specied in the current Department of Education Secondary School handbook.In February , education officials approved a development proposal to redevelop the integrated college to deliver a modern, post-primary school capable of accommodating the increased demand for integrated education in the area.The planning papers due to be formally approved next week outline a proposal to build ultra-modern accommodation to the east of the current school, with new sports accommodation extending to the west, encompassing part of the footprint of the existing school.A new single storey sports suite will extend from the schoolrsquos northwestern elevation of the new buildings and includes a hall, gym, fitness area and ancillary accommodation with the main school building intentionally designed to allow Shimna College to continue operating during construction work on the new-build.It is understood that phase one will focus on the construction of the main school building, excluding the proposed new sports provision. All of the existing school will be bulldozed when the new-build is complete, apart from the existing sports hall.It is believed that this part of the current post-primary building will only be razed to the ground when work on the new sports facilities have been completed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer action to make comeback  ","story":"LOCAL soccer clubs are in preparation after the resumption of training was given the green light.The Stormont Executive announced a plannedto training from April .Celtic Bhoys FC, Downpatrick and Killough FC are among the local clubs which have welcomed the news with open arms following a frustrating last few months.Celtic Bhoys FC have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare for training to take place at their newly built Ballyhornan facility.Club chairman Patrick Moore said: ldquoWe are really excited to be able to start afresh this season and make the most of our new state of the art G pitch and clubroom at Ballyhornan.ldquoWe will aim to maximise this as a community hub for local people and families throughout the coming year and we firmly believe this will provide a  for the club to grow and prosper in the post Covid- world.He continued: ldquoThere is no doubt that this has been an extremely dficult year for so many, particular those who have lost loved ones as a result of the pandemic.ldquoThe club is excited to have the opportunity to once again provide sporting and social activities to young and old in the local community.

The highest recorded speed was an eye-watering mph at Camlough.The number of drivers detected travelling at mph over the past three months by the seven speed indicator devices has reduced from  during April, May and June to  mdash a reduction of .%. The average percentage of cars travelling in excess of mph has also decreased slightly.Additional speed indicators are due to be erected at the Dundrum Road in Clough, Downpatrick Road in Ardglass and Ballynahinchrsquos Saintfield Road, with the PCSP planning to install seven more during the new financial year.But demand for the devices is high with a total of  requests lodged with the PCSP for them to be provided in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Willie Clarke have expressed concern that some drivers are continue to speed in built-up areas but have welcomed confirmation that overall, speeding in a number of hot spot areas is decreasing.Mr McGrath described the speeds recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick as ldquohorric and chilling.He continued: ldquoWhata local resident or child was to step onto this busy road  The footpaths are narrow in places, the lighting in the area is poor and residents are at times walking and driving in fear for their lives.ldquoSuch high speeds will not help allay their fears and I will be writing to the PSNI and asking for regular speed checks on this road to regulate the speed and ensure residentsrsquo safety.Cllr Clarke said while some of the speeds are very worrying, he said the data recorded by the speed indicator devices provides police with the information about where they need to be and at what time to catch those who are breaking the law and putting other road users and pedestrians at risk.ldquoI welcome the reduction in speed which the data reveals, but more needs to be done. Police now have the data they need to catch offenders and this is something that many people want to see happening, he continued.Cllr Clarke said the Department for Infrastructure also has a role to play in helping address the speeding issue.ldquoThe speed devices are having an impact and with plans for many more across the district, it is important that the critical data they provide will enable the authorities to apprehend those who are not only breaking the law, but placing themselves, other road users and pedestrians at risk, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford it’s like nowhere else on earth  ","story":"STUNNING Strangford Lough features prominently in a new Sunday Times guide with the area regarded as one of the three best places to live in Northern Ireland.While the accolade will not come as a major surprise to those who live and work on both sides of the internationally acclaimed waterway, the arearsquos recognition by one of the UK and Irelandrsquos top selling Sundays is nonetheless extremely noteworthy.While Holywood has been named as the top place to live in Northern Ireland in the Sunday Times Best Places to Live guide mdash ahead of Magherafelt mdash local focus will rightly be on Strangford Loughrsquos inclusion in the top three.The Sunday Timesrsquos expert judges behind the guide assess a wide range of factors, from schools, air quality, transport and broadband speeds to culture, green spaces and the health of the high street.They look for improving towns, villages or city centres, for attractive, well designed homes and locations bursting with community spirit which the coronavirus pandemic has shown to be the most vital quality of all.Of Strangford, the judges said: ldquoLive in Strangford, Portaferry or any of the villages around this beautul island-studded lough and yoursquove got unbeatable wildle and scenery on the doorstep ndash and itrsquos even betteryou can get out on the water.

For physical health and emotional health and wellbeing it is so important.”The club has , members, including  who play as well as social members.Players went out in pairs to play just nine holes instead of the full  so that as many members as possible could book a round.“Normally a round of golf has got four people, which is called a four ball, but because of the restrictions they are only playing two balls,” she said.“We’re only playing nine holes instead of the normal , and that’s to facilitate as many members as possible getting out.“The clubhouse is closed too. It is dferent, on a normal day we would have a lot more golfers but the restrictions allow just two people at a time.”At Hillmount Garden Centre, owner Robin Mercer was handling  click and collect orders and said he had to bring in extra staff to cope with the demand.“It’s OK for the supermarkets, they are geared up for click and collect, whereas our website is more general, for deliveries and letting people see what we have, so we have had to react very quickly. It’s been a learning curve for us this morning,” he said.“It’s better than nothing but it’s not ideal. It’s annoying when you see garden centres in England, Scotland and Wales open.“I can’t understand it.

Boris Johnson advised public buildings, including theatres, to close and mass gatherings to stop.This week,  months on, campaign group We Make Events Cymru, reflects on the impact of Covid- and how the lockdown restrictions has had a devastating effect on their industry.The impact of the announcement back in March last year meant that the UK event sector came to an outright standstill, resulting in events being cancelled, theatre and music shows could not be staged and thousands of Welsh event professionals could not work.We Make Events Cymru, , has spent the last  months lobbying the Welsh Government to highlight the need for continued sector support in order for the events organisers, iniduals and supply chain to survive Covid- restrictions.After a year of campaigning, We Make Events Cymru continues to push for opportunities to re-open the sector in light of the Welsh Government Coronavirus Control Plan , which does not allow gatherings of more than  people in Tier .As a result of many conversations with the Welsh Government, We Make Events Cymru has created a survey to gather the much needed data to evidence the number of people involved in the sector and the contribution they make to Wales and its economy.Stephen Burkitt-Harrington, Director of Production  one of Walesrsquo leading Creative Events Companies, said: ldquoThe Welsh Government has been saying all along that it could not reopen events of any kind without industry specic data. We were surprised to learn that they were not collecting this information though.\"This is why we have put together the biggest survey of our industry ever undertaken in Wales. Companies big and small, venues, events, and every inidual involved in even the smallest way can contribute now.\"By giving us as little or as much as people are prepared to contribute, we can then provide the government with the much talked about data they say they need to see how valuable our wide ranging industry is to the Welsh economy, and how important it is to get it open again as soon as it is safe to.Alongside the survey, the group have also recently launched their own website which gives sector colleagues access to wellbeing and financial advice, access to a database of Welsh event organisers, suppliers and iniduals, as well as a forum to chat and exchange ideas ndash resources that the team believe is vitally important during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:We Make Events Cymru is in regular dialogue with Welsh Government to lobby, and is part of the working party preparing for Covid-safe outdoor and indoor test events. These test events are an integral stepping-stone to get the industry in Wales back working again .Sarah Hemsley-Cole, Director of Cardf based SC Productions and the Lead Coordinator for the campaign said: ldquoWhilst we have to accept large mass gatherings are not possible in  ndash it is essential that we keep up the pressure on Welsh Government to allow covid safe cultural activities in the Summer of .\"We are a creative and innovative sector, and by working with Welsh Government to develop appropriate guidance and to generate factual data and evidence from the test events, we can get performers, artists, technicians and the eco system back to work and audiences back to what they love.Working alongside partners such as Equity, Creu Cymru, BECTU, Cardf Music Board, Cult Cymru, Freelancers Make Theatre Work Freelances Task Force, What About Weddings and The Musicians Union ndash We Make Events Cymru has helped give the industry and events people a crucial voice during these unprecedented times.Following on from the recent budget announcement, We Make Events Cymru acknowledge the essential package of support already received from the UK and Welsh governments, and is pleased to hear of the further support expected with the extension of furlough, additional SEISS grants ndash which now includes newcomers to the industry who started their businesses in the   tax year, as well as the Cultural Recovery Fund.We Make Events Cymru are now waiting to hear about additional financial aid and get a better understanding of how long this relief money is expected to last business and iniduals in Wales. There are still thousands across the country who have been excluded from any kind of financial support ndash these people need to be recognised and also offered funding.The campaign group is also calling for the events industry to be considered on a par with other industries like hospitality and the Film and TV sector for things such as insurance and financial schemes.The UK is internationally recognised for delivering impressive cultural events. Within it, Wales plays a signicant role with its tremendous highly skilled workforce, many of whom have now had to ersy to work in other jobs.The impact of the lockdown will be felt within the Welsh events industry for many years to come.

Among the most prominent events to be affected in Wales in  have been the National Eisteddfod, the Royal Welsh Show, Hay Festival, Abergavenny Food Festival, Cardf Half Marathon, Llangollen International Eisteddfod, Green Man and Ironman.

Wales Millennium Centre, Motorpoint Arena Cardf, Pontio,Venue Cymru and Aberystwyth Arts Centre were just some of the venues that lent their support to the campaign.We Make Events Cymru is calling on anyone who contributes to events in Wales and its eco-system to complete the survey in order to evidence the valuable contribution the sector makes in Wales.For more information about the survey, visit: https:www.wemakeevents.cymru . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That passing trade is something we rely on, and wersquore blessed to be in a great location.ldquoThe problem is, when people have a drink they forget about social distancing.\"Asked what he thinks of the latest changes, he said: ldquoItrsquos so important we try and get open outdoors as quickly as we can, more so for people in more remote areas where people are unlikely to drop by for a takeaway.     ldquoFor the good of the industry we need the beer gardens to open as soon as possible. I canrsquot see any reason why that wouldnrsquot be being spoken about now.ldquoPerhaps therersquos something we donrsquot know. If that is the case, then come out and say it because none of us want a third wave ndash that would kill businesses. The critical thing is we can have an uninterrupted summer.Is he expecting the high numbers some of his customers are predicting this weekend ldquoYes, probably ndash there has been a buzz since they let people travel locally, so Irsquod expect another rise in numbers again.ldquoWe need to be careful for our residents. We are a public service and we donrsquot want to cause trouble. Traders have got to remember that.Residents and friends Tracey Scott and Debra Cooper have enjoyed visiting the unusually quiet beach at weekdays through the pandemic, but said they will avoid the seafront this weekend.ldquoI hope people continue to be weary, Ms Scott, who lives alone at her home in Llandough, said. ldquoBut it seems to me recently people have stopped social distancing as much.ldquoI come here with friends and family sometimes three times a week, but I have to avoid it on weekends now.ldquoThere are just hordes of people not keeping to social distancing rules. Itrsquos a great shame.ldquoI walked with my mother here not long ago and was being bumped into by people. I canrsquot put myself at risk, and I canrsquot put others at risk.ldquoItrsquos so dficult because I live alone and I keep away from people Irsquod very much like to hug. Then someone comes and brushes past me. I know it sounds odd, but you do feel almost violated when that happens.ldquoItrsquos dficult, because I really do want the businesses to thrive here and I would like to support them on the weekends.ldquoMy message to people would be lsquogive it time, and letrsquos play it safe ndash donrsquot all rush at oncersquo.Ms Scottrsquos son and his partner, in their twenties, are also avoiding weekend trips to the seafront due to her son having asthma.Ms Cooper said: ldquoFor months now Irsquove only gone out in the week because it gets so busy. Itrsquos strange ndash the nice weather comes and the residents keep out the way.Hugh Pickford, who owns Pickfordrsquos Gallery and Bar With Rooms on the seafront, says he feels for residents, and itrsquos become dficult for traders to police overcrowding.ldquoItrsquos probably bred by us not being able to open indoors and police the situation ourselves, he said.Social distancing signs remain after the road had to be temporarily closed due to people packing the Esplanade over ChristmasldquoAt the moment people come and get a takeaway and go across the road. The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side. The seafront has really seen a revival in the last couple of years. Even at am now Piotr at Stol Coffee draws a crowd here. Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly. Itrsquos people flouting new rules that will cause a second wave.Claire Dunning said: ldquoWaiting for the next lockdown. People will take liberties.
