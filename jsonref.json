But now a portrait of one of history’s most formidable women by one of the world’s greatest painters has been rediscovered – and it will go under the hammer next month.The Portrait of Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj, painted in the mid-17th century by the Spanish master Diego Velázquez, has undergone painstaking authentication and conservation by Sotheby’s since it was brought to the auction house’s Amsterdam office 18 months ago.With an estimated price of £2m-£3m, it could be bought by either a private collector or a world-class museum. “Velázquez is one of the absolute stand-out titans of European and world painting. This portrait is unquestionably of interest to scholars and admirers of Velázquez alike,” said James Macdonald, Sotheby’s senior specialist in Old Master paintings.It is also a rare depiction of the most influential, avaricious and manipulative woman in 17th-century Rome. Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj was the power behind the papal throne, and the reputed lover as well as sister-in-law of Pope Innocent X. Nicknamed Papessa – the lady pope – Donna Olimpia was an ardent feminist, championing Rome’s prostitutes and nuns alike.She was a “baroque rock star”, according to Eleanor Herman, author of Mistress of the Vatican: the True Story of Olimpia Maidalchini. “Women from all over the Catholic world came to Rome to station themselves outside her palace and cheer as her carriage rolled out.“They could not believe that a female from modest beginnings had risen to such heights, running the nation of the Papal States and the Catholic church, an institution where women were not – and still are not – allowed any power at all.”Donna Olimpia determined foreign policy and chose cardinals. Kings and queens across Europe sent gifts of gold and diamonds to curry favour. No decision was taken by Pope Innocent before consulting his sister-in-law. “People in Rome hung banners over the pope’s name on public buildings that read Pope Olimpia I. Medals were minted showing her wearing the papal tiara and sitting on the throne of St Peter,” said Herman.But the men of the papal court despised and feared her. One cardinal deplored the “monstrous power of a woman in the Vatican”. Another contemporary said that never before had a pope allowed himself to be “so absolutely governed by a woman”. Another cardinal said that the government of Rome was “in the hands of a whore”.Roman artists, musicians, playwrights and sculptors enjoyed her patronage. She was behind the commissioning of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, the extravagant fountain in the Piazza Navona that is today a major tourist attraction.“She was a woman of fierce passions, keen intelligence and great charm, who protected weaker women against the injustices of men. She was also greedy, calculating and at times chillingly cold,” said Herman. Soon after her death from bubonic plague in 1657, the Catholic church “moved to eradicate the scandalous memory of this audacious woman who had ruled them all”.Several years earlier, Velázquez had made his second trip to Rome, during which Donna Olimpia sat for the master. “Her character was captured in this portrait – you can see she was a pretty stern inidual,” said Macdonald.Ownership of the portrait – a companion to Velázquez’s Cardinal Camillo Massimi, which now hangs at Kingston Lacy, a National Trust house in Dorset – was meticulously documented until 1724. “Then the trace went cold,” said Macdonald.Now it is known that the painting ended up in the Netherlands, where in the 1980s it was offered at auction as the work of “anonymous, Dutch school”. It was bought by a private collector, who bequeathed it to its present owner.Sotheby’s showed the painting to Velázquez experts in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Macdonald recalled: “Bit by bit, the jigsaw fell into place. It was incredibly exciting. Everyone who saw it was amazed that this picture, long deemed lost and thought probably to have been destroyed, had actually risen from the ashes.”The painting will be offered at a Sotheby’s sale of Old Masters in London on 3 July, alongside works by Gainsborough, Constable, Turner, Rubens, Botticelli and Brueghel, collectively estimated to be worth up to £66m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19a2880336b0ce20a7360d39a5308c9a6461fcba/608_1279_7041_4225/master/7041.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98c0016d993ab96e1099f3c6606c9be2","title":"yorkshire sculpture international review","story":"Various venues, YorkshireTrawl through all the self-conscious noodling in this high-pedigree collab ning four galleries and two cities and you’ll glimpse of authentic, balletic brilliance – but is it worth it?The Yorkshire Sculpture International ought to be better than it is. A collaboration between Leeds City Art Gallery and the Henry Moore Institute next door, the Hepworth Wakefield and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, it is an up-and-down affair. There is no real sense of collaboration or unified curatorial overview, over and above the idea that “sculpture is the most anthropological of the art forms”, an axiom provided by sculptor Phyllida Barlow. Discuss.Korean Kimsooja has installed a mirrored floor (not again, you splutter) in Yorkshire Sculpture Park’s chapel, and put film on the windows to refract the light, casting rainbows round the chapel. It doesn’t do it for me. Maria Loboda has dead, exotic insects poking out from behind the specially installed alabaster light fittings in one space at the Henry Moore Institute. Huma Bhabha has installed a specially commissioned, cyborg-like figure between a statue of Queen Victoria and the war memorial in Wakefield. Carved from styrofoam then cast in bronze and painted, it grins at nothing and no one, like a recent arrival from another planet. At least it is an escape from the Damien Hirst sculptures in Leeds town centre, and towering over the sheep in Yorkshire Sculpture Park. I guess they are here to add a bit of oomph. I have nothing to say about them.A Hirst ram with golden horns occupies a room of Victorian paintings at Leeds Art Gallery, where Rachel Harrison shows an abstracted grey head that appears constructed from cardboard packaging and burlap. Trapped under one corner is the wrapper of some equally cobbled-together industrial snack bar. The visible bit of the wrapper tells us this undoubtedly flavoursome treat contains cured bacon, berries and sunflower seeds, with no added antibiotics or hormones. I guess the sculpted head grew up on a similar diet.Joanna Piotrowska has carpeted a nearby gallery and dotted it about with works from the museum’s collection. Around the walls she shows black and white photos shot in people’s homes in different countries. She asked the inhabitants to create shelters using rugs and piles of books, tables, boxes, houseplants and whatever else they had around, and then photographed the tenants in situ, cowering under the kitchen table, crawling out from their make-do tents and half-hidden behind their indoor barracades. These are fun, but the overall installation doesn’t mean very much.Upstairs in the recently restored Great Court, with its wonderful (and only lately uncovered) Victorian skylight, Ayşe Erkmen has built a skeletal full-size model of the barrel-vaulted roof in the gallery below, whose floor was a later addition to what was a full-height atrium space. Standing on the floor, you look up though Ergman’s welded, polished aluminium structure to the real roof above. The experience is strangely dislocating. I wonder for a moment if I am one of those figurines architects use to populate their model buildings.Give me instead the slightly Ghostbusters blob-thing that has sidled up to a pillar in Nobuko Tsuchiya’s group of works here. Her disarming, somehow friendly sculptures and arrangements have also mostly been made with what’s to hand. Playfulness is not to be underestimated as an art-making tactic, especially when it engages the viewer’s own imagination. You want to go home and do it yourself. Or hide under the table and never come out.At the Henry Moore Institute, Rashid Johnson has covered three big trestle tables with mounds of shea butter. Piled up like whole cheeses, sculpted into rough head-and-shoulders lumps, or left in broken and smeared pieces you are invited to play with, rub into your skin, smell or lick, Johnson’s Shea Butter Three Ways treats the waxy substance, derived from a nut grown across the African savannah, as something more than a sculptable material. You can use anything to make sculpture, but everything comes with associations. Shea butter is used as an emollient, as cooking oil, in cosmetics and traditional medicine. It is laden with cultural associations. This work is the closest we get to an anthropological nexus in the entire series of exhibitions.Upstairs in the library, Sean Lynch has resuscitated Flint Jack, a notorious 19th-century forger of flint arrow- and axe heads and other supposedly stone-age finds he discovered on his wanderings across England and Scotland, many of which he sold to collectors, antiquarians and museums. He made them all himself. An expert, self-taught artisan, he lived and worked by his wits and guile, and even conjured an old tea tray into a Roman shield. Flint Jack was the genuine article: a real fake, preying on the collector’s avarice. People half-knew they were being had, willing themselves into belief. A metaphor for the artist, then.Wolfgang Laib’s installation uses handfuls of rice to cover a large gallery floor at the Hepworth Wakefield , setting a few small stone sculptures, covered in ash, amongst little piles. I find this inordinately precious and dull, and refuse to believe, though there are many sincere suckers for this sort of thing.There is quite a bit of self-conscious noodling-about and ho-hum sculptures wherever you go. The best work at Wakefield, by miles, is by Iranian-born Nairy Baghramian. Using rough cast sheets of aluminium, and smooth resinous forms made from a hard pigmented wax used to polish metal, she choreographs the space. The stepped and rounded rhomboids, wedges and blocks have a great solidity and weight, yet seem capable of gliding about. An edge lifts from the floor. A tilted plane slumps, another form accommodates itself to an aluminium slab. Sometimes two forms are pressed together by oversize clamps. These cleavings and conjunctions feel like a slow, controlled ballet, with its holdings and releasings, leanings and supportings, convergences and separations. These movements all have a choreography of care about them, as well as drama, even as the brittle shine and sharp, friable edges of the unfinished metal sheet buffs against the softer thickness of the waxy forms. I love all this. Bahramian really knows how to use space and light as well as form. There is a sense of flow arrested, time suspended. Even her photographs of smoking chimney stacks, the vapours steaming and trailing across empty skies, adds something to the overall installation. The more you look and walk around, the more you notice details, yet somehow it is all very quiet and understated.The Yorkshire Sculpture Park has mounted a survey of American sculptor David Smith, taking us through his career from the 1930s to his untimely accidental death in 1965. Principally a welder, Smith’s development is followed through a series of galleries and out into the open air. This is an instructive, self-contained exhibition, which follows Smith from his prewar development, influenced principally by Picasso, Julio González and Giacometti’s surrealist period, and his work in car plants and wartime tank factories in the US, to his increasingly abstract postwar work. Later, Smith became a bit too frontal for me. He veered between a kind of totemic figuration and abstraction. In his later work there is all too often a front view to be looked at, rather than a sculpture to be walked around. The work’s installation reinforces this view. His best work was a kind of steel and iron bricolage, here you feel him working things in the round. The rest is just all heft.A trip to the four galleries and two cities over the next 100 days is unlikely to prove or disprove anything much at all, other than that there doesn’t seem to be any shared idea here about what sculpture now might be, never mind about the anthropology. The Yorkshire Sculpture International is going to have to up its game to make further editions worthwhile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f12d29f2ed766a188a567a301032d6d2d97d40e7/0_0_4485_2827/master/4485.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e7ca66d408fb731202256e8cc2532a50 2020w","title":"darwin earthquake city centre evacuated after 72 magnitude tremor","story":"Bureau of Meteorology says no tsunami threat from quake, which occurred at a depth of 200km in the Banda Sea, north of AustraliaDarwin residents have reported buildings swaying and parts of the city centre have been evacuated after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit the city.The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Banda Sea, north of Timor-Leste, on Monday and prompted reports of large tremors in the Top End city.The Bureau of Meteorology issued an alert just after 1pm saying there was no tsunami threat to Australia following the earthquake.Residents in Darwin reported large tremors and feeling tables shake but there were no immediate reports of major damage or injury.Jonathan Bathgate, a seismologist at Geoscience Australia, said the 7.2 magnitude earthquake had occurred just before midday approximately 700km (435 miles) north of Darwin. The quake had hit at a depth of about 200km below the sea.“It was certainly something that was felt quite strongly in the Darwin CBD area,” he said.A Darwin resident, Leah Potter, told  Australia it had felt like “everything was rocking”.“It felt like there were two,” she said. “First there was just a little one and my son came in wondering what was happening, then there was a pause and there was a really a big one and the place was rocking.“We went outside and there were backpackers, I don’t know what country they were from, but they were holding on to the railing looking pretty scared. But, yeah, everything was rocking for a while.”A Palmerston resident, Kavinda Weerachandra, said some small cracks had appeared on his wall after the quake. He was at home working when “all of a sudden everything started shaking”.“I can hear my house creaking and rattling. And things on my desk started to fall. And I was genuinely worried for my life for a second there.”Parts of the city’s central business district were evacuated after the tremor.Domenic Fracaro was one of hundreds of residents and office workers evacuated during the earthquake. He told the ABC he had been preparing lunch at a kitchen bench “when I heard this roar”.“I thought it was a jet aircraft down very low, and my wife started running for the front door,” he said. “All the drawers started opening in the kitchen, and I said to her, ‘What’s going on?’“And she said, ‘It’s an earthquake, come on, let’s get out of here.’“So I left everything there and we ran down the fire escape, but while we were in that stairwell, the stairwell was rocking that hard, just side to side.“I lost my balance, a couple of times. It’s the worst one I’ve ever experienced in the four years we’ve been here, that’s for sure.”Bathgate said earthquakes of that magnitude were not uncommon in the Banda Sea.“We get magnitude sevens not often but on a regular sort of basis,” he said. “The last magnitude seven in this area was in 2012 at 7.1, and prior to that there was a 7.1 in 2005. They happen sort of once every 10 years or even more frequently than that.”The quake came just hours after a 6.1-magnitude earthquake hit Papua, also in the eastern part of the south-east Asian archipelago.That quake hit about 240km west of the town of Abepura in Papua province, at a relatively shallow depth of 21km, according to the United States Geological Survey.There were also no immediate reports of casualties.A shallower 6.3-magnitude hit the area last week, but the damage was not extensive.Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity owing to its position on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, where tectonic plates collide.A University of Melbourne earthquake scientist, Assoc Prof Mark Quigley, told  Australia that seismic activity in the region tended to “ebb and flow”.“The seismic activity waxes and wanes all the time – it’s one of the more seismic active parts of the planet,” he said.“So we get ebbs and flows and sometimes they talk to each other, they communicate stresses along the plate boundary and set others off. There’s nothing particularly sinister about major earthquakes there because they’re literally happening all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44245f3cd2f69368fac1e4fc1757cc730a22240c/0_132_3320_1992/master/3320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=052ddd9fa70ec5f81bab0f7a493b80e3","title":"on chapel sands laura cumming extract memoir mother","story":"In an exclusive extract, the Observer’s art critic tells the remarkable story of how her mother was abducted as a child – and how it was covered upThis is how it began, and how it would end, on the long pale strand of a Lincolnshire beach in the last hour of sun, the daylight moon small as a kite in the sky. Far below, a child of three was playing by herself with a new tin spade. It was still strangely warm in that autumn of 1929, and she had taken off her plimsolls to feel the day’s heat lingering in the sand beneath her feet. Short fair hair, no coat, blue eyes and dress to match: that was the description later given to the police. She had come out of the house that afternoon and along the short path to the beach with her mother, Mrs Veda Elston. They had already been there for some time, with biscuits in an old tartan tin, digging and sieving the sand. The tide was receding when they arrived, the concussion of waves on the shore gradually quietening as the day wore on by now the sea was almost half a mile in the distance. In this lull, on their own familiar beach, and so comfortingly close to home, Veda must have let her daughter wander free for a moment. For she did not see what happened next.Someone moved swiftly across the beach and began talking to the little girl. Someone she perhaps knew, because no sounds were heard as they coaxed her away. One minute she was there, barefoot and absorbed, spade in hand, seconds later she was taken off the sands at the village of Chapel St Leonards apparently without anybody noticing at all. Thus was my mother kidnapped.I see the scene again and again, always trying to grasp the unfathomable moment in which she vanished and everything changed. The place where she was playing empties into air the tide freezes the beach turns blank. Time stands still on the shore. How many minutes before her absence begins to register, before Veda becomes uneasy and then fearful, before the silence is broken by shouting and rushing to the spot where the spade lies fallen? The waves continue their impervious lapping, gulls drifting on the surface as the afternoon fades. How long before anybody missed my mother?I have the police report of that day. It is scant. Mrs Elston takes her daughter to the beach at or around 2.30pm. Approximately two hours later, the child disappears so fast that she couldn’t have got anywhere near the water. Unable to find her on the sands, Mrs Elston retraces their steps, searching the path and even the house in case she might have found her way home. Neighbours help look for the child. An urgent telegram is sent to the father, who is away for work, summoning him back to Chapel.All of this is duly reported to the police, but not until the following day and not, I suspect, by Veda. I hear instead the brusque authority of my grandfather George. Veda appears silent with shock. All she offers, via her husband, is the possibility that the child must have wandered up the beach behind her and out of sight. She herself was sitting on a blanket, knitting or staring dreamily out to sea in the mild afternoon sun, as I imagine it, with one eye on the child, occasionally plying her with biscuits – until she just slipped out of view. Perhaps the crisis was not immediately apparent. After all, the beach at Chapel was so innocent, like the child and her little legs could not have carried her far. But then came darkness with no trace, and more stricken searching, before Veda had to spend the first dreadful night alone without her daughter.How could she have disappeared? The beach, to begin with, is completely flat. A broad street of spotless sand, scattered with angel-wing shells, it seems to stretch forever in both directions. There are no coves, dunes or rocks where an adult could hide a child everything stands in open view.To reach it, you must walk up and over an artificial incline of heaped sand that is supposed to act as a barrier to the sea a barrier so ineffectual that houses, cattle and villagers have been swept away in historic storms. This little embankment runs for miles along the coastline and from its top people can be seen walking far away in the distance. Tennyson, the Victorian poet born and raised not far from Chapel, was drawn back to it all through his life. “I used to stand on this sand-built ridge,” he wrote in old age, “and think it was the spine-bone of the world!”Veda’s mother once saw Tennyson on Chapel Sands: pressing along against the strident north-easterly winds, black cloak blowing, hat held on in brows-down melancholy.Come over this ridge and even more surprising than the flatness is the way the sand appears to merge with the sea. The beach is tawny brown and so is the brine, because it washes over beds of clay. On a still day they become one vast continuous expanse, an optical illusion only dispelled when a chink of reflected blue sky gles the water or a sudden gust troubles the surface. Perhaps that stillness slowed the events of the day. Veda did not notice what was happening quickly enough. Nobody scrambled up that ridge in time to spot any hurriedly departing figures. Footsteps muffled by the sand, voices dispersed on the mellow sea air, all it took was a prolonged moment of parental inattention. No commotion. Nobody saw, and perhaps there were few other people there to witness the incident, for it was a weekday afternoon in October. Nor was this yet a crowded beach as it is today in high season. Black-and-white photographs from the 1920s show deserted sands or very occasional hikers in hobnail boots and straw hats buying tea from a hut by the Pulley, as they still call the narrow passage where horses once pulled cargoes of tobacco and paraffin over the ridge into the village.The beach was always Chapel’s livelihood. Boats went out for whiting, people searched for mussels, shrimped in the waves at low tide. Ships sometimes ran aground, stalled in the shallows, their debris washing fruitfully ashore. There might be wood for the fire, treasurable in those days before electricity and on Sundays people took bags and went coaling. Stranger things turned up too. A ship running guns lost its dangerous cargo at Chapel and soldiers had to be brought in to handle the live ammunition. A case of glassware was shared out among the villagers, not a single piece shattered. And once a crate of grapefruit spilled out across the sands, odd yellow globes never seen before by anyone except Mr Stow, proprietor of Stow’s Stores by the Pulley where in the world had they come from?All along the sea’s margin, curds of delicate foam arrive on incoming waves. My mother used to hurl them gleefully about, risking her father’s instant reproach. In winter, sea-driven winds direct from Scandinavia skim sand into the air, stinging the eyes and gritting the mouth. There are spring tides when the water feels warmer than the grey rain spattering its surface and blazing summer days when you can swim forever, it feels, along the unchanging shore. This level strand, with its inviting sea, was the great playground of my mother’s youth. She went there with George, paddling in the shallow froth, clambering about the tide pools, digging holes, drawing in the sand. He took photographs of her with his Box Brownie and even in those monochrome days, they show the beach at Chapel exactly as I knew it too, from the holidays of my own childhood.Photography gives us memories we hardly knew we had: the house where we were born, our infant selves, the embarrassing clothes we once wore. But the camera is also capable of giving us memories we cannot actually have because we were not there in the first place. This rare gift, this strange illusion of deja vu, characterises all of George’s pictures for me. He photographs his daughter on the shore, laughing in a swimming costume I remember as pale lilac, embroidered with a butterfly, though of course I neither saw nor wore it. She sits in front of a bell tent with a kettle brewing on a portable stove, its meagre flame the result of the purple methylated spirits that fuelled it, and I scent that sharp stinging reek. There is a picture of her beaming at the bottom of a gigantic hole which I know George has been excavating all day, the sand damper and colder the deeper he digs into the secret innards of the beach. She is carefully seated inside, in clean clothes for the camera. I am with her, smile pinned to my face too, waiting to be lifted back out.Every beach shot is ecstatic, and almost proverbial: my mother looks happy as a clam. Years of happiness, or so it seems, on Chapel Sands. I particularly love the sight of her perched on the shoulders of a sunbrowned man who bears his load with patient resignation. She is about five, so tanned her eyebrows look white, and the lilac costume is nearly slipping from her thin body as she lifts her arms like a gleeful reveller at a festival. The man’s name is Frank, and he is a friend of George, who is in his customary position behind the camera. But a line of apparently innocuous foam is stealing up behind them. Not many weeks after the picture was taken, Frank fell deeply asleep on an inflatable raft on this beach. The tide stole him away to his fate, a dark disappearance somewhere out in the North Sea.All the beach photographs in the Elston family album were taken by George. He would not yield his Box Brownie to anyone else, which is why he never appears on the shore with his daughter. But on the other hand, neither does Veda. I did not notice these absences as a child, leafing through the illuminated treasury of my mother’s early life, images to go with the stories she told, but of course they strike me every time I look as an adult. George Elston is there, recording the moment, but his wife is not. My mother has not a single memory of going to the beach again with Veda.The photographs in the family album are few and tiny, no larger than a matchbox, in a landscape-shaped book that is barely 10 inches by eight. This modest volume has only 22 pages, yet half of them are completely empty. All my life this puzzled me. For years I thought it was a matter of thrift but film for a Box Brownie was relatively cheap, even for a poor family like the Elstons. In fact, George appears to be selecting only the best images from many rolls of film for his album there are rejects in the back, and considerable time passes between one picture and the next. And time is precisely what I should have noticed. There are no photographs of my mother before the age of three. There are none of Veda, George and Betty together, and the whole narrative runs out when she is around the age of 13. One decade in the light, then many black pages.“Betty, Chapel.” This is written in George’s firm hand on the back of these photographs of his daughter. Other people drift in and out of shot, nameless strangers, now forgotten. But she is always given as Betty. Except in one stray image, slipped inside the back cover of the album, never attached, that does not fit anywhere in the sequence. This picture shows my mother as a young child on Chapel Sands, but with a different name on the reverse in an unknown hand. Here she is not called Betty. She is Grace.My mother was born on 8 August 1926 in the shadow of a windmill in a Lincolnshire village. One month later, she was christened Grace in the parish church. No father is cited on the birth certificate the child was to be considered fatherless. At the age of three, she was passed to George and Veda Elston, given this new name Betty, and taken to live in Chapel St Leonards. The Elstons were going to be her parents now. Henceforth, she was to be considered lucky.But she did not feel that way. As an adult she began to call herself Elizabeth, having always hated the name Betty, specifically for its associations with George. It was incredible to me, when young, that this abundantly loving woman could so have loathed her father that she would change her own name to be free of his reach. But I knew very little of her story yet, and neither did she. My mother did not see her own birth certificate until she was 40. She did not know that she was once called Grace, had no sense of her existence before the age of three. The knowledge of her early life came – and went – in waves over the years. Something would be established, believed, and then washed away then it would happen all over again, the arriving wave disrupting the old in a kind of tidal confusion. Even now, in her 90s, she has no idea precisely how or why she ceased to be Grace, but I know that it was before she ever reached the home of Veda and George. She stopped searching long ago now I must discover the truth of her story.The name they will be calling in desperation on the sands that day is Betty – Betty Elston, three-year-old daughter of the Elstons at No 1 St Leonard’s Villas, who are well known in Chapel. George Maybrook Elston – he always signs his name in full, with some flourish – is a travelling salesman. He sells industrial textile soaps, setting off by train every Monday morning with a suitcase of samples to extol to factory managers across England all the way through until Friday. He is away on that autumn day in 1929. So Veda must try to reach him wherever he is, perhaps in Leeds or Liverpool in a commercial hotel. They do not have a telephone, and neither do any of their neighbours, so she goes to the post office at the back of Stow’s Stores to send that frantic telegram. Mrs Stow offers comfort Mr Stow gathers other villagers to join in the search. I suspect they have private thoughts about where she is, and even who might have taken her. Perhaps that is why the police are not involved until the following day. But their guesses will all be wrong.The hue and cry ran along the coast from one village to the next, from Chapel to Ingoldmells and Anderby Creek. If the missing child left any footprints in the sand they led nowhere, or faded out too soon. If there were witnesses who could offer something more useful than the colour of Betty’s dress then they never spoke up, even when the policeman called. The first day passed with no news of her, and then another by which stage the police could surely offer only dwindling reassurance. Three more days of agony followed. And then Betty was discovered, unharmed and dressed in brand-new clothes – now red, as if through some curious Doppler shift – in a house not 12 miles from the shore.My mother has no memory of these events. Nobody ever spoke of them at home, in Chapel St Leonards or anywhere else. It was another half-century and more before she even learned of the kidnap.The dead may be invisible, but they are not absent so writes St Augustine. We carry their influence, their attitudes, their genes. Their behaviour may form or deform our own. The actions of all these villagers have affected my mother right up to this day, most particularly the behaviour of her parents and those who took her. Her life began with a false start and continued with a long chain of deceptions, abetted by acts of communal silence so determined they have continued into my life too. The mystery of what happened, how it changed her, and her own children, has run through my days ever since I first heard of the incident on the beach 30 years ago. Then it seemed to me that all we needed was more evidence to solve it, more knowledge in the form of documents, letters, hard facts. But to my surprise the truth turns out to pivot on images as much as words. To discover it has involved looking harder, looking closer, paying more attention to the smallest of visual details – the clues in a dress, the distinctive slant of a copperplate hand, the miniature faces in the family album.I picture each scene, as we all do with puzzles, assembling the evidence in the mind’s eye. But the habit is also involuntary. My mother is an artist, my father was an artist it is the family profession. Every evening, after teaching at Edinburgh College of Art, my father would draw for hours in his sketchbook. These drawings took the form of lyrical abstractions of the golden mean, the cuneiform alphabet, the newly revealed wonders of the subatomic particle, occasionally a couple of highwire acrobats for his children. But recollections of the day would materialise too: a student at an easel, a bowl of spaghetti cooked by my mother, and all conceived within frames just as her doodles during a phone call would appear as finished tableaux. She might even draw the telephone itself, with its spiralling cord, add an elaborate table, then set the table with dahlias, all while hanging on for a dentist’s appointment.She taught me how to remember paintings in those long-ago days before I could take their image home from the museum in the blink of an iPhone: first draw the frame, then summarise the main shapes and volumes in rapid thumbnail. Rembrandt sketched a Titian in just the same way at an Amsterdam auction. Even the picturing of pictures is ingrained.This is almost the only way that I can think, in fact. And I have thought of this day on Chapel Sands all these years, trying to imagine who took Betty – “presumed stolen” is the police phrase – and how it could have happened, to gauge the force of it, the effect on her and on everyone involved. I picture Veda, bewildered, afraid, inexperienced, not long in charge of this child who is suddenly lost, perhaps never in charge of her again on the sands George, trying to control the situation at a distance, rushing home to take charge Betty, an inkling in blue, moving about the beach in the last of the light, and then gone. The more I have discovered, the more I realise that there was a life before the kidnap, and a life afterwards, and they were not the same for anyone.• The above is extracted from On Chapel Sands: My Mother and Other Missing Persons by Laura Cumming, published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus on 4 July (£16.99).

It’s fun, You get the health benefit but unconsciously as it is so much fun you have done seven miles without noticing it.” Butler-Adams is aiming to sell at least 6,000 ebikes this year and will take the bike, which was developed over six years with help from Formula One team Williams, to Germany and the US in the next few months. The bike is already on sale in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and France, as well as the UK.Brompton already has more female riders than many other bikes, as it is relatively light and easier to carry. But the company is trying to do more by opening its own stores in high-profile locations, such as Covent Garden or Westfield shopping centre in London, employing some female assistants and making the outlets more like a normal retailer than a traditional blokey bike shop.It is also putting £1m into expanding its bike hire scheme – under which a Brompton can be rented for £3.50 a day – to 50 more sites over the next three years, which is about double the number it has presently.At a cost of more than £2,500 for an ebike, and at least £725 for a traditional folding version, a Brompton is not obviously accessible for a wide audience.But Butler-Adams says the company is struggling to keep up with demand as the bikes are built to last, easy to store and carry on public transport and built by employees who are paid the London living wage plus a share of profits.“If you said to me 10 years ago that someone would spend £800 on a phone I would have laughed you out of the joint. Why are we spending that? Because it’s useful.”With 35 designers, and a team of IT experts now in place, Brompton is working on a family of bikes which will broaden its appeal further.“Our houses are smaller and smaller and we buy more and more crap to put in our small houses. We need to move to not having a new phone every two years and chucking it in the bin but having things that are better quality and more relevant and longer lasting and sustainable consumerism.”Butler-Adams says that more people are turning to companies like Brompton which “walk the talk” on the environment and looking after their staff, and those which don’t will ultimately be winkled out given the ease of finding information online.“Unless you start giving a shit you are going to go bust. With younger people, if you don’t engage with their values then they will walk. Not just in the UK but all over the world,” he says.As Brompton tries to keep up with demand, Butler-Adams says the company has been eating into its £1.5m stockpile of parts because it is producing more bikes than expected this year. It keeps its stocks in a warehouse near Heathrow to act as a backup in case of any Brexit-related problems with imports.But Butler-Adams says £1m of the stockpile will be staying in place for about two years in an attempt to combat the potential stresses caused by Brexit-related changes in import and export charges, and procedures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/458574b7b4255bd5a42b973dd4bb0308c49ed8a8/0_0_6875_4128/master/6875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d57e33362a11c619ee431cc01ffc8bf","title":"brexit three years economy fairness politicians","story":"Has Brexit been a success? Now there’s a question. Remember how Zhou Enlai famously (albeit apocryphally) declared in 1972 that it was “too early to say” what the impact of the French revolution had been. He must be turning in his grave at this, because the UK hasn’t even left the EU yet – and may well never do so.However, Brexit is a process, not an event. Whatever happens over the next few months and years, it will dominate UK politics and economics for the foreseeable future. Given this, the third anniversary of the referendum feels like a good moment to take stock.And so we have. But first, some background. In February 2017, we at UK in a Changing Europe set out four “tests” for Brexit. We deliberately did not base them on what was going on in negotiations between London and Brussels. Rather, we decided to focus on outcomes. We argued that the referendum campaign, while iding the country – as Brexit continues to do – also revealed some key themes underlying the British political debate.And there was – perhaps surprisingly – considerable common ground across the referendum ide about what we should be seeking to achieve as a country. Generally, both sides argued that the UK should remain an open, outward-looking country that both economic growth and social cohesion mattered that we should invest in, and improve, our public services and that we needed to maintain the UK’s international influence while preserving democratic control of our own destiny.Three years, three meaningful votes, numerous European council summits and who knows how many negotiating sessions on, our approach has been vindicated. While the timing and form of Brexit is, if anything, even less clear now than it was in 2017, the same themes – growth, fairness, openness and control – continue to frame the debate. And so we’ve gone back to our tests, and tried to evaluate where we’re reached.Our verdict is unequivocal on the impact to date. While the apocalyptic predictions of the remain campaign have not materialised, the economic damage has nevertheless been significant. The vote to leave the EU triggered not just a one-off inflation shock, but also more persistent impacts on investment, trade and migration. So the economy as a whole has suffered, and the UK is already a somewhat less open economy. Nor are we, in any measurable sense, a fairer society. Finally, the seismic political impact of Brexit means that the UK has, perhaps paradoxically, lost control, at least temporarily, over some aspects of its economic future.But these are early days, to say the least. The transitional arrangements set out in the withdrawal agreement foresee a period during which much will continue as now. Though it’s worth noting that the United Kingdom will enjoy far less influence over EU policies than it does as a member state, and hence even less control over its own destiny.Our judgment on the prospects for the future is necessarily more tentative. The consensus amongst credible economists – that Brexit will, overall, be negative for the UK economy and public finances – remains intact. Note how few of those who have published forecasts have seen the need to revisit them. Indeed, that consensus has if anything been strengthened by developments so far, as the prospect of any Brexit that retains single market membership and free movement appears ever more remote.Correspondingly, however, the UK will enjoy considerably more control over a range of policies – trade, regulation and migration – than at present. The challenge of how to translate that gain in notional sovereignty into a genuine sense among the electorate that they have a real say will be central to British politics after Brexit.The prospect of greater control means that the question of openness remains, well, open. Some new barriers to trade with the EU seem inevitable. But so far, perhaps surprisingly, developments in both Westminster politics and public opinion mean that prospects for a relatively liberal immigration policy look better than for some time.The most difficult and uncertain issue remains what future governments will do to address the underlying discontent that, at least in part, drove the Brexit vote. In other words, what can and will be done to make the UK a fairer society. Theresa May spoke of addressing the “burning injustices” in our society, and many – regardless of their views on Brexit – hoped for a “reset moment”, with new policies to address those numerous structural issues that have been neglected in the past.So far, however, the government has simply not had the space, time or capability to develop the domestic policy proposals and instruments – on investment (public and private), skills, regional policy and so on – that would be needed.Will this change should the UK leave the European Union? Unfortunately, the performance of our political system in the three years since the referendum hardly inspires confidence. The infighting, paralysis and accompanying media focus on the Brexit process in Westminster (and yes, some of us must share responsibility here) have both detracted and distracted from any serious or coherent approach to these substantive issues. At the moment, there appears little chance that this will change – but if we want Brexit to be a success, change it must.• Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe.

Consider last week’s news about Facebook, and the fact that three years of corporate disgrace – and rising noise from legislators about bringing the tech giant to heel – have yet to slow its terrifying quest to insinuate its workings into every area of our lives. Now, in a move that could have been taken from a futuristic novel, it wants to create nothing less than a new global currency.Naturally enough, the idea is presented not in terms of profit maximisation, but the philanthropic feelgoodery that seems to make northern Californians billionaires as a matter of accident. One element of the initiative is making person-to-person transactions possible at either low or no cost – so that the migrant worker, say, can wire money home to their family and be assured that no one will be taking a cut. Moreover, thanks to the ease of wage and bill payments, people so far left out of financial services can cease to be “unbanked”, and thereby gain more personal freedom. This is hardly a new idea, but, as with most Facebook initiatives, it’s superficially a very good one.But, capitalism being capitalism, there are likely to be more venal motivations at work. There are vast markets in the developing world where Facebook and its subsidiaries have millions of users but are held back from creaming off advertising revenue by the simple matter of poverty. Libra offers new revenue opportunities, partly by inviting people to exchange national currencies for the new medium, thereby gifting Facebook and its partners a vast pool of funds. In these territories, and more affluent places, the new currency also offers Facebook the chance to accelerate what sits at the heart of everything it does: the harvesting of endless data, which can then be monetised.Facebook is at pains to address such anxieties, but its initial outline of how the new currency will be used in Messenger and WhatsApp via Calibra is not exactly reassuring. At the very least, Facebook will know the people and companies with whom its users have financially interacted, but that is likely to only be the start. “Calibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook, Inc or any third party without customer consent,” it says (my italics). Obviously, the company has past form here: the kind of forced consent that means you either allow Facebook to gobble up your data or don’t get access to many of its services. Whatever the guarantees, the most basic point is obvious enough: why should a company with such an appalling record on personal data be trusted to so massively extend its reach?Other questions abound. What will happen if Libra sucks national currencies out of already vulnerable economies? What will be its relationship to inflation? What of the dangers of international money laundering? Why are Facebook high-ups already talking about Libra extending into credit?Such concerns were highlighted last week by indications that India’s institutional hostility to cryptocurrencies means Libra will not be launched there, for the time being at least. But every bit as alarming is how the entry of Facebook into the creation of money will lead it to another sphere currently overseen by the state: beyond everyday consumerism, into the nitty-gritty of how we use public services and interact with government – in education, health, social care, crime and punishment, and everything else.Google has already got there, as proved by everything from its vast presence in the US education system to the use of NHS data by its artificial intelligence wing, DeepMind. But think about everyday payments: come 2050, across the planet, what currencies do we think will be used for taxes, benefits, fines, bail, student loan repayments and all the rest – and what will happen to the huge data trails such things create? In China, those on the all-encompassing social network WeChat – which Zuckerberg clearly wants to emulate – can use it to pay taxes and fines. Even in fusty old Britain, the Cabinet Office has already considered using Facebook logins as a means for people to access social security benefits, make council tax payments and get a driver’s licence. Why would it not then think about what we may yet know as Librafication?At that point, surveillance capitalism would colonise the shrinking parts of our lives it has so far left relatively untouched. It would amass mountains of lucrative information about everything from our friends to when we last paid a speeding fine – and in the process, bring unlimited corporate power into areas we still consider subject to the checks and balances of democracy. The state could also have a field day: can you imagine the glee at the Department for Work and Pensions if it was able to monitor not just people’s universal credit payments but how they spent them?But the biggest question of all is screamingly obvious, and worth asking for the thousandth time: how, in any meaningful way, can we hold Facebook – and Google – to account, and drastically limit their power? The answer surely starts with a massive international no to big tech’s most hubristic scheme yet. Otherwise the creators of fictional dystopias may as well give up: however surreal and messed up their imaginings, the world will have gone beyond them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36968431c9b152e540a42484467f00b34a025738/0_117_3520_2113/master/3520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0add80572de588a39cbf288abafa19c2","title":"found wallet prove us researchers lost honesty","story":"Which is all well and good, but how honest are you?

A historic victory for us, a historic disaster for them.All over Europe, the Green parties enjoyed modest gains, but nowhere did they gain so many votes as in Germany. Last week they even came out on top in one national opinion poll, overtaking Merkel’s conservatives for the first time.The success of the German Greens is surely linked to the weakness of the governing coalition of Christian and Social Democrats. Both parties struggle with image problems, partly connected to their leadership. The head of the Social Democrats, Andrea Nahles, has just stepped down following the party’s disastrous showing in the European elections. She was the party’s 10th leader in 15 years.But the Green wave cannot be explained away by its rivals’ failings. For decades denounced as eco-nerds and tree-huggers, the Greens have now conquered the progressive middle class and captured the zeitgeist. Green issues such as environmental protection, climate emergency and clean energy are mainstream. Vegetarianism and organic food are popular lifestyle choices. An extremely hot summer and the diesel scandal caused by German carmaker Volkswagen made even more people wonder whether the philosophy of unlimited growth and endless use of natural resources should be questioned.But there’s another reason the Greens have gained popularity. After the summer of 2015, when hundreds of thousands of refugees migrated to Germany, the new far-right party, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) grew stronger, fostering resentment and fear against migrants. Although some Green politicians pledged to help deportations, the party overall managed to stand up for a liberal migration policy and for being uncompromisingly pro-European. They are the antithesis of the growing nationalism, EU scepticism and anti-migration sentiment that is that is prevalent on the continent. So in a society that is deeply ided, the success of the Greens and the growth of the far right are two sides of the same coin.But in the eastern German states, Saxony and Brandenburg, the AfD became the dominant party – apart from in Leipzig, the biggest town in Saxony, where the Greens became the strongest party for the first time in 30 years. Twenty kilometres away from Leipzig, in the neat little village of Kieritzsch, one in two voters chose the AfD. It may have something to do with Kieritzsch being situated on the edge of an opencast mine. By 2038, coal-fired power production is meant to end in Germany and the mines will be shut down. The Greens want to speed up this process. The AfD, on the other hand, denies that climate change is manmade, and would keep the plant.Because of their successes in big cities, the Greens are actually contributing to deeper isions between urban and sparsely populated areas, between young and old, and between those who embrace globalisation and those who fear it.So if they want to reconcile the different groups, the Greens have to focus on social issues as well, such as how to pay, and who will pay, for the transition from dirty to clean energy from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric vehicles. Will it be chiefly the people in areas that today depend on coal plants and mines, or the owners of diesel cars?When Emmanuel Macron in France proclaimed a tax on fuel he faced a nationwide movement of gilets jaunes. His experience shows that green and social questions have to be looked at together. So the Greens have to focus harder on social politics. A few weeks ago they presented their model of a basic income for all families with children. To achieve this they would have to form an alliance with the Social Democrats and the leftwing Die Linke. The Greens feel strong enough to ignore their approaches at the moment and leave all options open. That won’t work in the long run.If the Greens fail to reconcile social and environmental matters, they risk being seen as part of a complacent elite, and will be fought by those who don’t feel represented. A fight like this, that leaves the political system as well as society wrecked, can be seen in Britain.

So let’s be creativeYou know those conversations that keep coming round, such as what you would do if the apocalypse happened (dig down), or where you would go if you had a time machine (either Cleopatra’s Egypt or a Cloud Atlas future to meet face-tat Hugh Grant)? One that occurs more and more within my friendship groups is about communal living in retirement: everyone chipping in to buy a house together, where we can play endless games of Mario Kart, sing D’Angelo round the Bösendorfer and indulge in vast quantities of mind-bending prescription drugs. I feel fairly confident that I’m a few decades away from having to think about it seriously, but I reckon waltzing through the twilight years in a shared house with all your mates could be a great way to loll about before the music stops and the needle lifts.I have just had a little taste of what it might be like. My friends Elen and James very sensibly got married in Cepha-bloomin’-lonia, and a whole big gang of us (maybe 16 in total, including bride and groom) were all bundled into one big villa for the week. It was nothing short of utopian: to while away the days in gooey sunlight, never wholly sober, comparing mosquito bites and discussing everything other than Tr**p and Br***t, among a clique so unquenchably fun, so unquestioningly generous and so totally incapable of monitoring their alcohol consumption. The whole flock was glitter-glam and gorgeous. And those unspoken communal understandings around isions of labour, they were happily respected by all. We had got each other’s backs, left no man behind and took it in turns to go to the bakery in the morning. As the week went on, it all began to feel quite possible: a new postmodern mode for family, anarcho-lushness, a gestalt alliance in sequins and cheap wine. It’s the dream, isn’t it – for retirement to be one long holiday?The current thinking on millennials’ retirement prospects casts a very dark cloud over any optimism my generation can have for old age. A 2018 report from the pensions investment company Royal London said that the average person will have to set aside £260,000 in their working life to have a comfortable retirement. While I’m fortunate enough to be fairly secure in my finances (by the fateful spin of a metaphysical fruit machine in my childhood), the majority of my friends simply can’t afford to save. At least half of them are creative professionals who, a generation back, would have been financially secure homeowners, but now, with student debt and the likelihood of a life paying rent, blowing a few hundred quid on a Greek holiday makes far more sense than dwelling on eventual existential hazards.I’m going to make a case for hope. Despite the intergenerational slander that Generations Y and Z regularly receive from our elders (in particular, it seems, from late-middle-age “liberal” white guys such as Bret Easton Ellis, Louis CK and Bill Maher), my impression of young adults today is that we have a far greater instinct for collectivism than any of the postwar generations. Growing up in a world with Wikipedia, Napster and streaming subscriptions has meant that concepts of ownership (physical and intellectual) are less important to us than they were to others before us. A preference for meaningful or hedonistic group experiences over the acquisition of stuff (driven in part by the fact that all the tech you need fits into your pocket and costs £30 a month) suggests to me that younger adults are already halfway there when it comes to a culture of cooperation, and we’re aware that the future will demand it of us.Far from being the epitome of narcissism, inidualism and entitlement (as, by the way, every generation in modern history has at some point been described), millennials will, I think, prove to be unique in the contemporary era. By dint of our sorry inheritance of economic, ecological and cultural shit-shows, most of us won’t be indulged with profligate earnings and courted by the “virtues” of consumerism. The entropy of societies has to start reversing because ultimately we need each other more than we need status symbols.The millennial generation may be destined to be one of the poorest, in monetary terms, but if we’re careful, generous and tactile with one another we could be one of the wealthiest in terms of wellbeing. If we have each other’s backs, if we leave no man behind, and take it in turns to go to the bakery in the morning, I see no reason why we can’t look forward to a glorious collective retirement. I’m thinking somewhere coastal, somewhere I can strip off my make-do-and-mend clothing and pelt as fast as my old-lady legs will allow me, tits akimbo, into the ocean. And, bobbing there on my back I will gaze up at the sky, “the deep blue air, that shows nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f857caab081a06e58ebf6bb3cf8028626b4d0934/0_36_2150_1291/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c259d76acbdcd679aba87e5e82252a29","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of needle","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘needle’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘needle’.Share your photos of what needle means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 26 June at 10am.

It would be very difficult to shift society out of its current “comfort zone” of business-as-usual, but she thought the much higher environmental awareness among young people was a reason for great optimism.Hernández is chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which in May published the most thorough planetary health check ever undertaken. It concluded that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems, with a million species at risk of extinction.“If I look at my generation, the people who are running the companies and countries and society in general, I don’t know if we are going to be able at this point in time to make extreme transformative changes, because we love to do the things we way we always do things,” Hernandez said. “We are in our comfort zone and it is very difficult to change. If we do not, then I am afraid the next 50 years are going to be very dramatic for us.”“But if I look at young people, I am optimistic. They are people who have grown up with environmental concern,” she said. “I think we are going to have this transformation from the old society to a new environmental society in this 50 years. But if we cannot change business-as-usual we are going to be in trouble.”Hernández will oversee a series of new projects by IPBES in the coming years, including a detailed assessment of the connections between bioersity and food, water and human health. “If we don’t understand the relationship between bioersity and the very basic needs of our lives then we are not going to understand how deeply bioersity is important to maintain our own survival,” she said.IPBES will also examine the root causes of the destruction of ecosystems, beyond the direct exploitation of wildlife, to include poverty, conflicts and other political and economic factors. There will also be major reports on how global heating is harming bioersity and the relationship between business and bioersity.Some senior conservationists back moves towards declaring half of the Earth as a protected zone to rescue the natural world. But Hernández said the precise area designated was less important than having effective, on-the-ground enforcement, as some existing places were national parks only on paper.Hernández is a Colombian expert in international relations and bioersity, and said her work had been inspired by the incredible natural environments found in her home nation, such as the rainforests in Guainía. She said people could help preserve wildlife by buying sustainable food and products. “These things will help a lot,” she said. “I am reducing meat consumption at my house.”She also said people should use their votes for change: “People often do not vote because they know the proposals of the politicians, but because the person is charismatic or famous. Voters must understand the environmental proposals of the candidates.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de31a403ff76cc9b3153ba202dd5de3f94666a03/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db8d310a4e0a81978d0e05aa5faac158","title":"paris fashion week bruno sialelli channels the seaside in lanvin debut","story":"The 31-year-old designer’s first collection looked to the travels of house founder Jeanne Lanvin for inspirationBruno Sialelli may be hard at work as the new boy at Lanvin but he has holidays on the mind. For his first menswear show since his appointment as creative director of the house in January, the French designer mentally took the audience out of sweltering Paris and brought them to the cool breeze of the seaside. In real life, he invited them to a swimming pool in the 19th arrondissement and provided peach ice teas to set the scene.His newly adopted home has been on a journey of its own of late. In the past four years, a series of short-lived creative-director appointments under old management threw the brand into financial and creative chaos. It was a far cry from the headlining company it was under the former creative director, Alber Elbaz, who steered it to 14 years of sustained success before his acrimonious departure in 2015. In 2018, long-term menswear creative director Lucas Ossendrijver left after 14 years, too. As a result, Sialelli – who has worked in the design teams at Balenciaga, Acne, and most recently, Loewe – is the guy everyone is pinning their hopes on to reinvigorate its trajectory.In January, CEO Jean-Philippe Hecquet revealed that Sialelli had been tasked with “bringing back to life this beautiful and unique fashion house, and once again inspire a passion among our customers,” and the 31-year-old designer heard him loud and clear.As with his womenswear collection in January, the new menswear range looked to the life and travels of house founder Jeanne Lanvin for inspiration. This manifested in a mash-up of fabrications, including intarsia knitwear – like tapestries depicting seascapes she would have picked up and brought home – and beaded embellishment, such as trinkets she might have found in a bazaar.The theme of holiday paved way for nautical stripes – in knitwear and seersucker suiting – and sailor collars. Straw holiday hats (the dodgy kind) had hand embroidered Lanvin motifs and bags were the colour of an orange buoy. Mermaid (taken from Lanvin’s antique taps), shell and starfish prints made repeat appearances, while a series of reinterpreted beer-mat prints ticked the ironic box that’s proven an undeterrable trend of late.There’s a new mood to the house that reflects both Sialelli’s youth and experience. His former employer, Loewe, is a venerable lifestyle brand as much as it is a fashion house, with its artistic collaborations and references central to its appeal. For this show, Sialelli channelled the same stimuli, not least with the invitation which was a limited-edition print by the artist and rising star Luke Edward Hall featuring four men in Lanvin-blue swim trunks.Sialelli, however, is targeting a younger audience than his last house as a concept, this was more first freedom than established culture vulture. He said backstage that he wanted to “express something easy and cool and French” with his team who “are excited about working with new languages” and, with this, he is heading in the right direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dcc3e29d895ca43e17afc3edf080c966ac29452/0_135_2047_1228/master/2047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64f754947c9cfe7d7dc9def8dfa76915","title":"streaming the edge of democracy documentary brazil petra costa what is democracy astra taylor","story":"Not exactly a fun night in, but these documentaries about politics in crisis make for compelling viewingAt a moment when Britain is held bleakly in limbo by the ever-grimmer Tory leadership contest, you may not be in much of a mood for documentaries about politics in crisis. “Sit back, pour yourself a chilled glass of white and watch how we collectively got into this mess” isn’t the greatest pitch to anyone fleeing news channels to flip through Netflix for some distraction of an evening. Yet two compelling documentaries, both new to the streaming realm, are essential in their examination of the frail, threatened state of contemporary democracy on a global stage: it’s hard to look away from either.One of the year’s standout docs on any subject so far, The Edge of Democracy recently landed on Netflix after an acclaimed, Sundance-launched festival run. An impassioned, personally invested project from Brazilian actor turned film-maker Petra Costa, it’s a furious unpacking of what liberals left winded by Brexit and Trump may view as a real-life worst case scenario: the rise of far-right populism that installed reactionary bigot Jair Bolsonaro as the country’s president last year. To Costa, like many of her protesting compatriots, his victory signalled the end of hard-won democracy, delivered by voters looking back at decades of military dictatorship with something akin to nostalgia.If you’re looking for stolid journalistic reportage, head elsewhere: narrated by Costa herself, who is upfront about her familial connections to the Brazilian left, the film is polemic of a most graceful and persuasive order. But it’s also rich in knotty political and procedural detail, untangling a national disaster that has seemed rather confusing from a distance. With the ticking, anxious urgency of a political thriller, the film picks apart the combined, corrupt circumstances that respectively brought down former Workers’ party presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, while tracking the pavement-level public unrest that created the gap for Bolsonaro. It’s at once fascinatingly specific and distressingly universal: it’s hard not to note British and American parallels in the rumbling chaos.A erse ensemble of talking heads – ranging from enthused academics such as Cornel West to cynical members of the public, with few white men among them – contribute their own theories to Taylor’s argument, which is neither tidy nor encouraging in its conclusions, and points to problems bigger than even Trump or Brexit. What can democracy in even its best form achieve, the film asks, when it’s still beholden to global capitalism? You may want to pour yourself another glass of wine. But these are valuable, exciting films to have in the present moment.Finally, a welcome return to the streaming world: out of operation for some time while it underwent a sleek makeover, classy cinephile site Le Cinema Club is back, offering one selected gem a week to watch free of charge. This week’s choice, Chris Marker’s 46-minute documentary The Koumiko Mystery, is 54 years old and yet, as it follows a young woman through Tokyo during the 1964 Olympics as she considers her uncertain place in the world, it still simmers with political vitality.Arctic (Signature, 12) As a plane crash survivor stranded in guess-where, Mads Mikkelsen valiantly tackles the elements in an elegantly stark, mostly silent survival thriller.Cold Pursuit (StudioCanal, 15)Also tersely braving the frost, Liam Neeson headlines Hans Petter Moland’s needless but amusingly deadpan remake of his own 2014 Scandi crime comedy In Order of Disappearance.Loro (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15)Baggily edited from two TV films, Paolo Sorrentino’s Berlusconi biopic gets the vulgarity and venality of its subject, but misses the crisp, crisp, acidic bite of Il Divo.Dekalog (Arrow, 15)Still penetrating and surprising, Krzysztof Kieślowski’s landmark series of short, morally exploratory TV dramas gets the 4K Blu-ray treatment it deserves.

Coming off her line, the Brazil goalkeeper Barbara could only push the ball on to the shoulder of the incoming Gauvin, a collision that resulted in both players requiring treatment.Only after a couple of minutes was a decision taken for the apparent goal to be reviewed, with the Canadian referee Marie-Soleil Beaudoin deciding Barbara had been fouled.It meant France ended the half without a shot on target, with Brazil’s best effort an acutely angled shot from Cristiane that was beaten away by the right foot of Sarah Bouhaddi two minutes from the break.There was no doubt about France’s go-ahead goal in the 52nd minute as Diani again teed up Gauvin with a low, piercing ball into the six-yard box. On this occasion Barbara failed to intercept, allowing the Montpellier striker to stab home her seventh goal in her last nine internationals.Brazil responded but Bouhaddi tipped on to the crossbar a 55th-minute looping header from Cristiane, who had met a deep free-kick from Marta.Eight minutes later Brazil levelled, courtesy of VAR, as Debinha was initially flagged offside in receiving a through ball down the left. The move culminated in her delivering a cross that was cut out by Wendie Renard but straight into the path of Thaisa to firmly drive home from 12 yards. Despite the offside flag, a quick consultation with VAR from Beaudoin ruled Debinha onside, giving Thaisa her fifth goal in her 65th appearance.At 1-1 after 90 minutes, the game then swung within two minutes either side of the extra-time interval as just before the break Mbock Bathy Nka superbly cleared off the line a goal-bound shot from Debinha following a powerful run into the area.Then in the minute after, Henry struck the winner to the delight of the partisan crowd.After the match, Marta – who scored her 17th World Cup goal this tournament to become the all-time leading scorer at men’s or women’s finals – gave an impassioned speech to reporters in which she willed the next generation of female Brazilian footballers to come through.“There won’t be Marta, Cristiane or Formiga forever,” she said. “Women’s football depends on you to survive, value it more. Cry in the beginning so you can smile in the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54f60048e6b44c702afad7a6bf6d15f2f2d2850/0_71_4700_2820/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de6c01de57a066a3e9502e1d4b96a0d0","title":"why are the best footballers in the world suing their bosses","story":"The Women’s World Cup is nearing the knockout stages, with the tournament favourites, the US, in blistering form.

Naturally, what this means to me is that the thought of meeting her is absolutely terrifying, so I sit down in the Parisian hotel where we have arranged to do the interview and tell her this. She is dressed in black, of course, her slightly hunched posture making her look more like her 64 years. She is sipping a tiny coffee, and isn’t remotely surprised I’m terrified.“People think I’m judging, but I’m not judging,” she says. “I’m watching. It’s different. People sometimes say, ‘My God her eyes will scan you,’ but it’s not to judge you. It’s to get ideas. It’s observation.”Well that’s all right then. French Vogue, under her tenure from 2001 to 2011, was a force to be reckoned with. It looked like nothing else. She believed in bold ideas and she loved boobs, even naked on the cover. She loved cigarettes dangling from models’ mouths. She loved fur. And she loved curves. She used unskinny models Crystal Renn and Lara Stone, and did a cover with the blonde, mainstream-looking model Carolyn Murphy prancing around with Andre J, a black transgender model in a dress and a beard. “Would Anna Wintour ever allow such a thing?” asked the American website Jezebel at the time.I have brought the current issue of French Vogue with me and we flick through it together. All the models are the exact same skinniness. “I do not like this,” she says. “I like older women. I like bigger girls. I like black women. I did everything first. But people forget, because people forget everything. I feel totally comfortable with everyone. It is my strength, to be open-minded, always.”It does seem to be true – she is even interested in my red handbag, which is made of fake leather, cost about £50 from a small animal-friendly brand she’s never heard of, and is bursting at the seams “because you put too much stuff in it,” she says, as if she’s my mum.After too many years spent reading all those books about how to be chic like a Frenchwoman and hating them so much I’d feel compelled to go straight out and buy one about how to date like them, too, and then how to raise children who eat like French enfants, I feel I should be expert in how to be an insouciant yet glamorous Parisian – except it hasn’t worked at all. I am not remotely chic. My love life is so English it’s practically Chaucerian. My child subsists on potatoes. So I want to ask this most Parisienne of Parisiennes for her secrets – can she make me chic? I have this scarf, you see, and every time I tie it in a knot it doesn’t look right. I ask her to tie it better on me, but she takes it off me and ties it better on herself – by not tying it at all.“Never a knot,” she says. “But I learned this from Tom Ford, not France.” She shows me that you either wrap it around your neck once with two long ends dangling down either side of your chest, or you fold it so it’s doubled over and half the length and then thread it through itself a little bit like a tie. Not a knot, you understand.I ask Roitfeld, when I look at a Parisian woman who doesn’t have much makeup on and is in a simple navy sweater and jeans and yet looks stunning, what is she spending her money on. What has she paid for that I can’t see? Is it a dermatologist? Roitfeld nods – I have hit the nail on the head.“To be beautiful costs so much money,” she agrees. “For something you don’t see.” She favours the aesthetician Hervé Herau for her own skin treatments, which she suggests are just a bit of cream, really. She is not keen on younger women getting Botox at all, while she thinks older women often overdo it. “I don’t want to name names but there are some who can’t move their faces any more. Like Cher.” Roitfeld also says that French style is quite conservative, so the chicness comes from a certain coolness in attitude, a lack of overt polishedness, as well as the cut of the trenchcoat, the quality of the shoe. But she insists she prefers English style “because we are not good at fantasy, French people. In New York you see all this crazy nail art and I love that, too, but we French are more quiet, discreet.”But how, how do I become chic? There must be a way. She looks at me sympathetically. “Chic,” replies Carine Roitfeld, “is innate.”In the years after leaving Vogue in 2011, her son Vladimir worked on convincing her that her name was valuable and that rather than keep only working for other brands she could become one herself. She was surprised, but she trusted him, and gradually they went into business together, launching her bi-annual magazine CR Fashion Book, her creative talent agency CR Studio, and now her Carine Roitfeld Parfums, for which she has created her 7 Lovers range, sold exclusively at Net-a-Porter, each perfume is named after a different fantasy lover from her imagination. So there is the English lover, called George, like our royal prince, “Yes, like him, your future queen,” she says, suggesting either a language barrier or that she knows something I don’t about Prince William’s son.George the perfume started off quite green, so she added a shot of cannabis and a shot of espresso to the mix, as you do. Then there’s Sebastian, who comes from Buenos Aires and is as dark and troublesome as the tango, and smells spicy and woody and is “a very selfish lover, the fight between life and death is what I want for him, he’s very proud of himself”. So he’s the one you shouldn’t marry, I suggest. “Oh maybe you should,” she replies, quite seriously. My Englishness floats around me like virginity.Her daughter, Julia Restoin Roitfeld, has also been involved, having taken a nude photo of her mother a couple of years ago that they decided to use for her marketing, after checking with Vladimir. “If he say I can do it, I can do it.” She says the French aren’t hung up on nudity like we are, although when her own Russian father would parade naked around their French apartment during her childhood, the neighbours did sometimes call the police, “because they didn’t like to see it in front of their windows. But he didn’t care.”Vladimir also encouraged her to put a Muslim model in a hijab on the cover of her own magazine. The model was Halima Aden, a Somali who was born in a refugee camp in Kenya before moving to America as a child, becoming her American school’s homecoming queen and entering Miss Minnesota. Roitfeld saw those photographs, used her on the cover and Aden now has a high-profile modelling career, having now appeared on the cover of British Vogue, too.“When I’m thinking about something he say yes you can do this no you can not do this. He gives a balance to me, which I need, because I’m a bit fearless, I can go too far. When I put this girl with the Muslim scarf I was not sure because no one did it before. But he say, ‘I think it’s you, do it. Even if some people kill you, it’s you, do it. You open minds.’” At this point I realise this went beyond a cultural or fashion decision – she genuinely thought she might get murdered. “And they do kill me, but it’s OK.”Wait, Carine, nobody killed you, you’re still here. You mean you were… criticised?“Yes, but a lot. It’s different in different countries. When you’re doing something new, it’s normal to have critics. Every time I did a new thing I get criticised, but funnily I do a new thing because it’s my way of thinking, my way of loving people. I’m very open-minded. This girl was so beautiful, and she wore her scarf, and there are a lot of girls in scarves in fashion now – you’re not going to put them away from fashion, they’re too big now.”I mention how multicultural British Vogue has become under its new editor Edward Enninful. It’s been a huge shift. “Yes, good! But he took my girl! He take my model! Halima become a huge voice now and great for her. I find other ones. It’s part of the world today.”On the one hand, CR is from a world of French chic that is, to me, impenetrable. On the other, she is really very funny and tells me that she likes makeup best when you only take half of it off at night “so you’ve got black smudged around your eyes the next day, and this is why people think French women are dirty,” and that she doesn’t follow the supermodel maxim about obsessively moisturising on aeroplanes, “because I’m always too cold, I just put my big sunglasses on when I land.” Her high-powered morning health routine is composed of the two major nutrients, “espresso and cigarettes”, and she doesn’t like seeing women doing their makeup in their cars, on their way to work. Because it’s vulgar? “Because it’s dangerous!”As for her own relationship with the mirror, “I’m lucky because I’m rather blind now so I don’t see myself very well, it’s much better. Although I have to do my makeup in one of those amplified mirrors. Horrifying.” She did ask Tom Ford to show her how to take a good selfie, help her find her angle, “but he say to me: ‘Oh, you do not have a good angle Carine.’ I say: ‘Thank you Tom, that is nice of you.’ He say: ‘No no it is better that someone else takes your picture.’ I say: ‘OK, nice, stop. Do not say that.’ So I do not take selfies.”She misses Karl Lagerfeld. “I really lost someone very important for me. My father died 20 years ago and Karl was… not a new father for me, but a protector.” Since he died in February, she has taken on the role of style adviser at his namesake brand.I ask if he used to phone her a lot, but no, he would just text her photos of his cat, Choupette. “He was the king of sending big bunches of flowers and handwritten letters. No one else does it like this.” We meet just before French Mother’s Day, and she has been thinking about this, the first one since his death. “I know I will not get my flowers from him with the card saying you are a great stylist and a great mum. Mother’s Day is different date in each country, how could he even know it was Mother’s Day?”She has become so tender at this bittersweet memory that I wonder, almost dreamily, what sort of mum she was.“I was very tough with them. Screaming at them. Brush your teeth, go now to school, go and clean the car if you get a bad mark at school, make your bed, clean the kitchen even if the maid is coming. Say thank you to the taxi driver, say thank you to the waiter in the restaurant. My kids are well brought up because I was so tough with them. But I was very dedicated to them, too.” Every Saturday she would take Vladimir to play football Julia every Sunday to ride horses. She sent them to a bilingual school in Paris so they learned perfect English and now they both live in New York. She feels confident her parenting was a success, because, as adults, “They are very polite, they’re working and they’re not taking drugs. And my daughter would never leave her apartment without making her bed.”So how does it feel to be the most glamorous grandma in the world, now that Julia has a daughter, Romy?“Oh, but on Instagram I see a lot of glamorous grandmothers. Andrea Dellal, who lives in Rio and used to be a model. She is very glamorous and she has seven grandchildren. Very funny and laughing all the time, which is what I love, and she has good bones. And she has this, which I don’t have,” she says, pointing at her lack of cleavage. “But grandmothers now are not like before. My own grandmother seemed so old with her white hair. I dye mine.”You wouldn’t ever let it all out and go fully grey yourself?“Never say never but… certainly not.”She says it’s only younger people who could think the problem with ageing is wrinkles anyway, and that once you get old, you realise that the real trouble is your back, and your eyes going. Roitfeld tells me that six years ago, she had a bad fall, leading to seven operations on her back.“I have very fragile bones. I got the ears of my dad and the backbones of my mum.”I ask if she is in pain at all times, and for the first time she pauses before answering. I sense she doesn’t feel able to admit it, or to complain. “I have some good drugs,” she says, slightly quietly. She then insists that she has to keep wearing heels because flat shoes are, according to her, not good for your back, at which point I realise that chicness is not so much innate as incurable.Even if she’s not leaving the house, there are three things Carine Roitfeld never fails to apply every morning: “A bit of cream, a bit of black, a bit of perfume.” And there we have it: my new mantra.That night, I try her trick of leaving on my eyeliner and mascara and the next morning, oh my goodness, the transformation has actually worked. All right, so it’s my transformation into a panda rather than a Parisian, but still.

But are ‘life extensionists’ any closer to finding the key to longevity? Alex Moshakis meets some of the people determined to become immortalIn 2016, an American real-estate investor named James Strole established the Coalition for Radical Life Extension, a nonprofit based in Arizona which aims to galvanise mainstream support for science that might one day significantly prolong human life. Standards in modern medicine are allowing us to live longer now than ever before. But that is not Strole’s concern. What good are a few more measly years? He is interested in extending life not by days and weeks, but by decades and even centuries, to the degree that mortality becomes optional – an end to The End. “The deathist paradigm has to go,” a line on the Coalition’s website reads. “It’s time to look beyond the past of dying to a future of unlimited living.” It describes its supporters as “early-adopting advocates, numbering in the thousands”.Life extensionists (or longevists, or immortalists) fit neatly into two types. The first are rationalists: scientific researchers at the coalface of gerontology, the study of ageing, chipping away at the many technical difficulties of ending entropy. Strole is the second type. A businessman, he has no formal scientific training, but is nevertheless resolutely committed to the cause, eager to rally behind new findings. He hopes to live indefinitely, or at least until 150. But he is ultimately reliant on researchers finding a way. Consider him less a gerontological groupie than a politely optimistic mega-fan, sitting on the sidelines of science, willing on a major breakthrough.He isn’t alone. Life extensionists have become a fervent and increasingly vocal bunch. Famously, the community includes venture capitalists and Silicon Valley billionaires, non-gerontologists all, and nearly all men, who consider death undesirable and appear to have made so much money they require infinite life in which to spend it. But now mere mortals are joining the throng, heads filled with fantasies of forever. Humans have lusted after immortality for as long as they have been alive. So far the quest has been unsuccessful – we still die! But good news: paradise is reported to be closer now than ever before, and private clinics and online pharmacies are promising to help get us there, “there” being the future, all of it.Strole has been an evangelist of human immortality since he was a child, when his grandmother died, and he felt “a pain you can’t even describe, it’s so deep in your gut.” He was 11, still new to the world, and he came to think of death, like most of us do at some point or another, as deeply unfair.In the early 1970s, when he was in his 20s, he began touring the US as a public speaker, sharing what was then limited gerontological research, but nevertheless extolling its possibilities and advocating the anti-ageing benefits of a positive mindset: “Isn’t life great? You can live forever if you really try!” Because Strole is not scientifically accredited, he mostly based his patter around inspirational healthy-living tips, much of which would now fall under the umbrella of common-sense wellness: exercise, eat well but not too much, look after yourself. But still his message seemed radical, and he was not always well-received. Audiences wary of Strole’s ideas condemned him for testing God’s will, or disrupting the natural order. His concepts ran counter to the common world view – that we live and then we die. Particularly aggravated spectators referred to him as “the devil”. Every now and then he received death threats.Nevertheless, he persisted. He considered himself fortunate to work in a field that meant he was privy to insider information and he became convinced a significant breakthrough was around the corner. To fully prepare his body for the rigmarole of centuries-long life, he adopted a strict health regimen. He fasted, juiced, cleansed and devoured supplements, inviting audiences to do the same. Eventually, a community formed, driven by a shared, urgent aversion to death. “We felt then how important it was to do everything you could to stay alive,” he saysStrole is now 70. He lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, a desert town. In the life-extensionist mode, he avoids dairy and rarely touches bread, though he devours a whole heap of other things. Recently his diet has included pills, branded “Cognitive”, which he takes twice a day and claims have all sorts of nourishing effects on his brain. (What good is maintaining the body if not the mind?) The pills are part of a self-directed anti-ageing process that requires a lot of swallowing. On some days, Strole takes 70 supplements, including a tablet that “energises the mitochondria” (mitochondria produce energy) and whose effects resemble “a shot of coffee, minus the jitters”, as well as vitamins, multi-nutrients and metformin, a diabetes drug that has become so popular among life extensionists that one referred to it as “the aspirin of anti-ageing”. In the early mornings, when the Arizona air is still brisk, he takes a cold dip in his pool to shock his immune system into better function, and at some point or another he lies face-up on an electromagnetic mat that whirs silently against his body and “opens up the veins”, and engages in a breathing regime that, he says, “balances the hormones”.These are typical life-extension strategies, though most people supplement regimens with their own ideas. Some fast. Others arrange expensive stem cell replacement therapies. To maintain a supple mind, the gerontologist Marios Kyriazis, who is in his 60s and heads the British Longevity Society, reads the newspaper upside down, and whenever that becomes too easy, he reads the newspaper upside down and reflected in a mirror. Think of it as an alternative to Sudoko.What good is all of this? The current life-extensionist strategy is twofold. First, achieve a “wellness foundation,” Strole says. Second, stay alive until the coming gerontological breakthrough. All that is required is to “live long enough for the next innovation,” and presuming you do, “You can buy another 20 years.” Twenty years here, 20 years there, it all adds up, and suddenly you’re 300. This is a common view. Last year the British billionaire Jim Mellon, who has written a book on longevity, titled Juvenescence, said: “If you can stay alive for another 10 to 20 years, if you aren’t yet over 75 and if you remain in reasonable health for your age, you have an excellent chance of living to more than 110.” To most, 110 seems a modest target. Why not forever? “It’s not some big quantum leap,” Strole says, by way of explanation. He invokes the analogy of a ladder: “step by step by step” to unlimited life. In 2009 the American futurist Ray Kurzweil, another supplement enthusiast, coined a similar metaphor, referring instead to “bridges to immortality”.Where to begin with the almighty question: why would anyone think this a good idea? Strole is openly afraid of death (who isn’t? He argues), though he seems more motivated by a kind of curiosity. We live our lives knowing they will one day end. Imagine what we might accomplish if they didn’t. (It is not clear exactly what Strole might actually want to accomplish: self-actualisation? World peace? That tricky jigsaw?) The American entrepreneur Dave Asprey, who is 46 but hopes to live beyond 180, and who takes 150 supplements a day, told me: “I can’t imagine running out of exciting new problems to solve!”This motivation is common – the burning desire to help – and it can be seen as morally virtuous or horribly presumptuous, depending on your opinion on the altruistic potential of a bunch of disproportionately wealthy, middle-aged men. (Is it possible the future will become a refuge for the rich, who experience life as a sequence of exquisite events and who might not understand the concept of entropy as relief or escape?) Few life extensionists openly admit to hedonistic impulses. “You can only smoke so many Cuban cigars,” Asprey says, “before you’re like, ‘I’ve got to buckle down.’” Though when I asked the British gerontologist Aubrey de Grey why indefinite life appeals, he replied, half-joking: “My hot tub.”De Grey, a serious scientist, considers life extension a health issue, which is perhaps the field’s most convincing argument. Gerontologists are not hoping to end death, he says. Instead, “We’re interested in people not getting sick when they get old.” No matter how much society rails against the concept of immortality, nobody really wants to suffer through Alzheimer’s, or suddenly fall foul of cardiovascular disease. Gerontology is the act of developing treatments for age-related diseases, de Grey argues – of reducing the causes of death, not death itself. “The benefits of living longer are not the point,” he says. “The benefits are not having Alzheimer’s disease.” For de Grey, indefinite life is a by-product, not a goal.Are we anywhere near to a breakthrough? So far, research has produced modest yields. Gerontologists speak prophetically of potential, but most warn a significant human development remains somewhere far off in the distance – almost in sight but not quite. Richard Hodes, the director of the National Institute of Aging, a US government agency, told me that, though research in animals has led to “dramatic increases in life”, some of them multi-fold, “There has been far less quantitative effect as those models have moved towards mammalian species.” The biologist Laura Deming, who in 2011 established the Longevity Fund, a venture capital firm that supports “high-potential longevity companies”, told me that startups continue to successfully root out biological markers of ageing – inefficient cells, mitochondrial decline – but that, in humans, “We really don’t know right now what will work and what won’t.”Much of gerontology focuses on identifying types of damage that accumulate with age and developing ways to halt or reverse that accumulation. It has been discovered, for example, that as we grow older, certain cells become ineffective but nevertheless stick around, getting in the way like comatose guests at the end of a house party. Removing those cells have helped mice have longer, healthier lifes (this is called senescence.) Similar forms of genetic engineering have been successful in other animal models. But to reach the mainstream, gerontologists must convince government agencies to support human adoption, a complicated and long-winded task, given the general view that death is a normal human process. Why play God?In any case, it is likely that one single longevity strategy alone won’t help us much. Life extensionists enjoy a metaphor: humans are complicated machines, they say, like cars, but mushy. And what happens to a machine if you don’t look after it? It rusts. It splutters and spurts, until it reaches its inevitable conclusion. De Grey considers ageing a “multifaceted problem”. Humans incur many different types of damage. We don’t just rust. We scratch. We dent. Rubbish accumulates in our footwells and grime develops in our engines. We require multiple strategies of repair – constant fine-tuning. What’s the point in removing those senescent cells if that molecular junk continues to build up?De Grey shares Strole’s belief that innovations are coming. But, unlike Strole, he considers current strategies almost pointless. He does not take hundreds of supplements. He does not pay for stem-cell transfusions. “I want to wait and see,” he says. At 56, he is content to sit tight for treatments that have become “progressively more effective… so I don’t have to use clunky, first-generation therapies that may have side-effects.”This does not seem to bother Strole, nor others in the community. Time is running out! Bring on the treatments! At RAADfest, the Coalition’s annual conference – “the Woodstock of radical life extension” – visitors are invited to root through the latest in anti-ageing products, of which there are many. Try DHEA PRO-25, an “anti-ageing hormone”. Or NAD+PRO, advertised to “boost physical and mental energy”. Or Piracetam, from the family of “smart drugs”, or nootropics, which claim to enhance brain function. Strole named the area: “The marketplace of your future.” It is popular among RAADfest guests for the power of its promise: the opportunity to realise the hoped-for self. This is Wellness 2.0 – beyond the cosmetic. We have been anti-ageing our skin for years. Why not our insides, too?Jim Mellon is reported to have described the longevity market as “a fountain of cash”, and has urged friends to invest. Business is already lucrative, but it is a market that appears to take little notice of efficacy. The majority of anti-ageing products remain unregulated – “patent pending”, in the vernacular – and more than a few appear utterly useless. Earlier this year, the US government released a statement condemning the anti-ageing fad of transfusing young blood into older bodies, a practice researchers have proved effective in mice but which, the FDA said, “should not be assumed to be safe or effective” in humans. (The treatments cost thousands of dollars, and led to concern that “Patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors.”)A decade ago, the American Association of Medicine publicly condemned the sale of “anti-ageing hormones,” an industry that was reported to be worth $50bn. “Despite the widespread promotion of hormones as anti-ageing agents by for-profit websites,” the association said, “the scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking.”The oldest person to have lived, Jeanne Calment, reached 122, though she was perhaps not the greatest example of good health: she smoked until she was 117. The most successful life-extension methods we know of seem to be those we have known all along: eat well, sleep well, exercise, reduce stress and rely on modern medicine, which has prolonged average lifes significantly over the past 160 years.Strole does that and more. So far it’s working, he says. He is 6ft 4 and 13st – “the perfect weight” – with a slick of glossy grey hair. Perhaps his regimen is effective. Or, perhaps, like Calment, he has won a kind of genetic lottery, his healthy hair predisposed. It is difficult to say exactly, but, as of this moment, he will die. What happens if a breakthrough doesn’t arrive in his lifetime? “Well, then we’re in a little bit of hot water,” he says. But “it’s better to go for it than to not go for it. It’s better than just settling in. Don’t go quietly into the night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29cb6f1e3d11a8caa23ff8d57d7098ca801ca85f/59_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2aa183ae07f754b3b255fb1a92515b7e","title":"arab world turns its back on religion and its ire on the us","story":"The Arab world is turning its back on religion and on US relations, according to the largest public opinion survey ever carried out in the region.A survey of more than 25,000 people across 10 countries and the Palestinian territories found that trust in religious leaders has plummeted in recent years.Respondents also expressed concern over rising disquiet in their home countries: people in Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Palestine and Sudan, said they felt they were sliding towards dictatorship. More than six in 10 Algerians, and four in 10 Sudanese, believe the last elections were not free and fair, the survey found.Michael Robbins, the director of Arab Barometer, said the survey – which was conducted at random in private and face-to-face, and consisted largely of multiple-choice questions answered on a tablet – presented a number of significant findings.“Most importantly, in the vast majority of countries surveyed, governments are not meeting the expectations of their citizens,” said Robbins.“Often, trust in government tracks more closely with performance on providing security than on economic issues.”Respondents expressed a change in attitudes over a number of other issues, from migration and mental health to women’s and LGBT rights.Across the region, most respondents supported a woman’s right to orce her husband but felt that husbands rather than wives should have the final say on family decisions.The notion of a female political president or prime minister was most acceptable in Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia, and least acceptable in Algeria and Sudan.Dima Dabbous, Equality Now’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said the apparent contradiction in responses was “indicative of the dominant mood in the region”.“There is a realisation that gender equality is a marker of progress and the ‘right thing’ to say is to support women empowerment. But when the framing of the question focuses on the role of men, then the real patriarchal, male-centric bias comes to the surface,” said Dabbous.“Women in the Middle East and North Africa are getting more educated and participating increasingly in the labour force, but their empowerment will remain incomplete as long as they are still excluded from decision-making positions and political participation.”For taboo or difficult questions, respondents were asked to select “acceptable practices” from a series of options. People believed “honour” killings were more acceptable than being gay in all but one of the countries where this question was asked (Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Sudan and Tunisia).Dabbous said the responses demonstrated a machismo still heavily prevalent across the region."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e513afc42ddd647dccc6ba97589403a8eb4059/0_75_6200_3721/master/6200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7386f989a9983cef3af5b705281bd641","title":"how to stop biting your nails","story":"Nail-biting doesn’t necessarily begin as a result of stress or anxiety, but is often something that is observed and copied from a young age. Over time, it becomes a habit, potentially crossing the boundary into becoming a coping strategy. As a very physical act, nail-biting can provide a welcome distraction or sense of relief when you are feeling anxious or are in a heightened emotional state.The key to changing such habitual behaviours is to determine your motivation. Whether you don’t like the way your hands look with bitten nails, or you want to find a better way of dealing with your anxiety, you need to establish the negative consequences of biting your nails and why you want to stop.Then you need to search for alternative ways of coping or distracting yourself. Simple activities such as reading can help to ert your attention, or you can try occupying your hands by messaging friends or playing games on your phone. It’s essential to create your own self-soothing “toolkit”, involving little activities that help to calm you in an alternative way. For example, when you feel the urge to bite your nails, you could make yourself a cup of tea, or put on a nice hand moisturiser instead.These methods can work in tandem with products that are designed to combat nail-biting, such as bad-tasting nail varnishes. Such products work by attributing adverse consequences to the habit, helping you to suppress the addictive behaviour. However, for sustainable change, the key to kicking a habit is to be proactive. Identify what you are using the habit for and then find other activities that can replace it, creating healthier coping strategies.Dr Elena Touroni is a consultant psychologist and co-founder of the Chelsea Psychology Clinic in London.

While watching the HBO show High Maintenance, I noticed that Lee, the protagonist’s hip and beautiful love interest, was sporting hairy armpits.“Look!” I cried to my husband, as though I’d unexpectedly spotted a T-shirt emblazoned with the name of my favorite obscure band. For the past couple of decades, I have seldom shaved my armpits. Now, all of a sudden, I was on-trend.Among both celebrities and the masses, female body hair is sprouting all over. Ilana of Broad City has exposed her underarm growth so have Jemima Kirke and Zazie Beetz. In January of this year, Laura Jackson, a British college student, ran a campaign called “Januhairy,” urging women to grow out their body hair and post selfies on Instagram.In some ways, this phenomenon harks back to the second wave movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when feminists began to challenge restrictive beauty standards. At a famous march outside the 1968 Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, protesters ceremoniously discarded their bras and stiletto heels many feminists of that era also ditched their razors and tweezers. But today’s renewed enthusiasm for female hirsuteness comes with a distinctly 21st-century twist.Unshaven women in 2019 often meet other criteria for traditional feminine beauty –they have sculpted eyebrows, wear lipstick or sexy lingerie – while proudly displaying their armpit hair. If the ethos of the 70s was a refusal to spend time and effort on cosmetics, the more common approach today is for women to curate different elements of their appearance, remaining conventionally attractive while deploying body hair as a feminist fuck-you: half-statement, half-ornament.Enter Billie, a New York-based subscription service that sells “razors built for womankind”. In January, the company announced a $25m investment from Goldman Sachs and other backers.Billie’s most radical feminist move is to show, in its various promotional materials, women removing actual hair from their bodies: models dragging razors up shaggy, moistened legs. As the company’s web copy notes, “Commercials show women ‘shaving’ perfectly smooth, airbrushed legs. Strange, huh?” In a move that is either generously self-undermining or shrewdly opportunistic (or both), Billie also runs Project Body Hair, an image library of hair in all sorts of places it’s not supposed to be.One of Billie’s models is Hale, a 19-year-old musician and student at Bard College. On Billie’s website, Hale sits on the floor against a bed, wearing a frilled white tank top. She is smoothing the hair on her head back with arms raised, revealing undisturbed axillary fuzz.Hale hit puberty early, she told me, and her body hair was dark and noticeable. At one point, “I shaved literally everything,” she said. “I shaved my whole stomach when I was in elementary school, because I didn’t like my happy trail.” But in high school, she began to question the hairlessness ideal, and realized that “having autonomy over my body didn’t make me less attractive or less valuable”. Now, she sometimes, but not always, removes hair from her legs and other body parts, but never from her armpits. Until recently she waxed her unibrow, but as it grows back, she’s started to think it’s “really cute”.Billie’s branding strategy may come across as fishy – they do sell razors, after all. But it seems to fit right in with the emerging ethos around body hair: celebrating women’s choices as a hodgepodge of inidual decisions about how to adhere to or violate cultural norms.As Georgina Gooley, Billie’s 33-year-old Australian-born co-founder, told me, “If you choose to shave, we have a great product for you. If you don’t, we have other products as well.” (The company also sells lotion and body wash.) With Project Body Hair, she says, “We weren’t sending the message that shaving is an expectation. We were saying shaving is a choice.”Back in the 1970s, the conversation sounded quite different. As Rebecca Herzig writes in her 2015 book Plucked: A History of Hair Removal, two camps emerged in the second wave movement.The very first full issue of Ms. Magazine, in July of 1972, featured an article titled Body Hair: The Last Frontier. It criticized the shaving norm as an “embodiment of our culture’s preoccupation with keeping women in a kind of state of innocence, and denying their visceral selves”. The time, money and psychological energy required for depilation were oppressive. Hairlessness was also infantilizing – it made women look like prepubescent girls. The social norm suggested, not very subtly, that there was something inherently wrong, gross and dirty about women’s bodies as they naturally were.But another faction of feminists, led by Betty Friedan, had a different take. Friedan believed the preoccupation with body hair was counterproductive. She considered these concerns a trivial distraction from more important issues, such as professional opportunities and subsidized childcare. She also thought they harmed the cause of feminism by casting feminists as hairy, ugly, man-hating weirdos.I came of age in the 1990s, a midway point of sorts. My two best friends and I stopped shaving in high school. For me, this decision was not explicitly about feminism, but about an allegiance to my idea of authenticity (not to mention my allegiance to laziness). It wasn’t that I didn’t care how I looked I wanted to look like I didn’t care how I looked. I wanted to be attractive, but I did not want to invest effort or enlist artifice into making myself so. Any such measures, to my 16-year-old mind, would have been cheating.At the same time, I usually felt self-conscious about my body hair, and often wore pants or long skirts. Displaying smooth, bald legs would have felt like selling out, but I felt a different sort of discomfort displaying hairy ones. I envied one of my friends whose leg hair was fine and wispy. Mine was not. (Later I resumed shaving my legs.)Back then, in my recollection, body hair did not register much in the cultural conversation. The founders of Instagram were in middle school. Feminism was in something of a lull, with a few exceptions such as the Riot Grrrl scene. My favorite magazine, Sassy, did embrace feminism, but not in a way that involved challenging beauty norms very aggressively. As far as I recall, nary a patch of stubble could be found on the waifish bodies of their models.It’s hard to say exactly when what Hale refers to as the new “body-hair movement” emerged – she describes it as “non-boys taking up space and deciding that they’re not going to adjust to the norms”.But she remembers thinking something was afoot when dyed armpit hair became fashionable a few years ago. One of the pioneers of that micro-trend was Roxie Jane Hunt, a hairstylist in Seattle.Hunt, 35, shaved as a teenager, but, she says, “I always hated the action of doing it. It felt like a big chore but also a little bit of violence against my own body.” When her daughter was about two, she saw Hunt shaving and asked her why. “I realized I didn’t have a good enough answer,” Hunt says. She grew out her armpit hair, and found it “much more sexy and natural”.In 2014, on a lark, she and a friend dyed their underarm hair “ethereal blue”, and Hunt posted photos of the colorful pits on her blog. “The blogpost kind of went viral from there,” she says. She described the attitude with which they approached the exercise as “sort of joy. It opened up a little more imagination.” Many people have since posted pictures of their “unicorn pits”, dyed in all the colors of the rainbow.If body hair has historically been invisible – too shameful to even show in razor commercials – this aesthetic makes it ultra-visible. In that sense, it takes the pro-hair ethos to its extreme. But in another sense, this practice is the opposite of the “let it all hang out” approach: it is, after all, hard to think of a grooming choice less natural, less laissez-faire, than polychromatic armpit hair.The look is also highly social-mediagenic, destined for virality. And social media, for both dyed and virgin body hair, is obviously a key part of what makes this round of hair affirmation different from previous eras. Women are not only refusing to conceal their body hair they’re flaunting it.A long-running debate within feminism has been whether we should respect women’s choices – even if they seem to result from oppression – or whether only certain “liberated” choices merit approval. The new body-hair acceptance advocates land squarely in the former territory. When I was growing up, a common catchphrase was “I’m not a feminist, but …” followed by some statement of support for feminist principles, such as equal pay. Now, much more common is something like the reverse: claiming the mantle of feminism no matter how un-feminist the position may seem.A theme that came through loudly in my conversations with young women was that we should judge nothing – except perhaps judgment itself. “I think the 70s wave of feminism was outright rejecting femininity. We don’t need makeup, we don’t want to be housewives,” said Ashley Armitage, a 25-year-old photographer who shot one of the Billie marketing campaigns. “Now it’s like, wait a second, you can be a feminist and a housewife. You can shave.”Surveying this new world of body hair, I wondered: are women making these choices because they think body hair is feminine, or despite the fact that they don’t think it’s feminine? Is there ever tension between their aesthetic preferences and their values?Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the prevalent reluctance to judge, no one wanted to say that they didn’t like any particular aesthetic choice. According to Gooley, the Billie co-founder, she found a range of attitudes in her focus groups and market research. Some women think “it’s a patriarchal view to force women to shave. Other women are like, ‘I just think it’s really cute. I like my underarm hair.’”Just as there’s a mix of motives, there’s also a series of decisions – not a one-time resolution to always shave everything or never shave anything. “So many people, maybe sometimes they’ll shave, sometimes they’ll grow their hair out,” says Armitage. “Sometimes they’ll shave their legs, sometimes they’ll grow their armpit hair.” Considering this reality, Billie’s pitch starts to make a little more sense.So far, this is all sounding very kumbaya: the shaven and the waxed and the hairy and the semi-hairy all getting along famously, showering each other with love and likes in a judgment-free festival. There is some truth to that: this discourse is refreshingly peaceable.But of course, it’s not all rainbows and unicorns. For all the love that the photos of body hair have generated, they have also, inevitably, attracted trolls. MaryV Benoit, another Billie model, told me about the comments on the campaign: “Seventy percent of them would be, ‘Oh, that is awesome.’ Thirty percent would be these weird men that would be like, ‘You girls need to shave.’” Some of the comments were nastier. And some came from women.Posting a picture of your hairy self online takes guts. You know that not everyone will approve, and some will let you know it. Merely going out in public with female body hair takes a different sort of courage. You’re less likely to hear direct insults, but more likely to get funny looks, unmediated by a screen.Female hairiness is still far from mainstream. But the more people who brave the all-caps comments and the whispers and stares, the less shocking it becomes. This is how norms change. And one of the few real upsides of social media, in my view, is its power to accelerate that process of dismantling dubious norms – not, in this case, in order to replace the old one with a new, equally unforgiving one, but to challenge the need for any norm at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f755c7ad8f80383438b0e41d8b56d69dc8b33272/0_412_2533_1519/master/2533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2ffe02afc87e16af38e09b3d8b6159b","title":"leaves become intricate crochet art in pictures","story":"Artist Susanna Bauer describes the delicate leaf and crochet sculptures she’s been making for the past 10 years as “a tribute to nature”.

Some reporters will be receiving hundreds of extra dollars in payments per week, sources told  Australia.The data on inidual performance is available via a proprietary analytics platform called Verity.Most major digital publishers use analytics platforms, including  Australia which has a tool called Ophan.According to News Corp, Verity “empowers our editors, newsrooms and content promoters with real-time information to understand and influence the content for which our audiences are willing to ‘pay \u0026amp stay’”.All News Corp mastheads, including the Australian, use Verity and identify staff who have done particularly well each week. But the Herald Sun is believed to be the first masthead to hand out financial bonuses to iniduals.“Welcome to this week’s Verity update ... and it’s a call-out to the Melbourne bureau to kick things off, in particular Ewin Hannan, who’s led the news agenda throughout the week on the John SetkaCFMEU story,” this week’s email from The Australian’s digital editor Daniel Sankey said.“Ewin has brought in almost 150,000 subscriber page views (as well as four subscriptions) on his own in the past week with his coverage of the story, with a dozen stories providing regular splashes and lead pictures for the website, m-site and app.“Also out of the Melbourne bureau, Rebecca Urban has brought in five subscriptions on stories including why children of Asian migrants do better at schools and Australia’s school bullying problem.”The new three-tier system at the Herald Sun will reward reporters who reach a certain number of subscriptions via their bylines. They will earn more cash each week if the number of paying customers goes beyond a targeted number and if those subscribers reach a certain number of page views.The idea is to get people to subscribe and then keep them reading, a source said.The danger of a rewards scheme based on popularity is that sensational stories and stories on crime and entertainment are often better read than policy or political analysis. But reporters were told management would not target people across the board and allowances would be made for the popularity of rounds.The reporters at Rupert Murdoch’s Melbourne tabloid were briefed on the “incentive scheme” last week. They were told it was a measure to encourage reporters to think about “selling” their stories to readers and being more “proactive” across the website and social media.The trial is confined to reporters in the first instance but may be extended to other staff, if successful, a source said.News Corp did not respond to requests for comment about whether the scheme would be rolled out across the country.The company has revealed to advertisers that Verity has already led to its recent focus on true crime content.“True Crime Australia, launched in July, packaged crime content within its own branded vertical,” the company said in a presentation.“Verity integrates multiple big data sources covering content, customer subscriptions, web analytics, social and promotional channels into a simple and intuitive platform for both mobile and desktop.”Earlier this month the company made 55 editorial staff redundant, targeting those without digital skills."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81717e9a9aeef04b613ecd2e0391b139b5a5525/0_25_4470_2682/master/4470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=844dd424bad46e1b0efec8529d9ca55b","title":"ease migration rules for indians to win post brexit deals say mps","story":"Cross-party group of MPs urges greater priority be given for trade talks with IndiaThe government must make it easier for Indians to come to Britain to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with one of the world’s fastest growing economies, a group of MPs have said.Warning that Britain is falling behind in the global race to engage with India on its path to becoming an economic superpower, the Commons foreign affairs committee said ministers urgently needed to update their strategy on India and could not rely on historical links from the days of empire.The cross-party group of MPs urged greater priority for post-Brexit trade talks with India, while calling on the government to facilitate the easy movement of people to come to Britain among priorities for improving relations.Launched as parliament hosts a dedicated day on Indian relations at the start of UK-India week, celebrating the ties between the two countries, the group of MPs told ministers they must either ease migration rules or be honest that tough controls will kill off the prospect of a “global Britain” trading around the world after Brexit.Leading Brexiters have used the idea of turning Britain into an outward-facing, global trading powerhouse among key arguments for leaving the EU. However, critics say the promise ignores the steps such a policy would require, including higher levels of non-EU migration and lower food safety standards.“While the global Britain strategy is barely being communicated in India, the ‘hostile environment’ message is being heard loud and clear.”The Conservatives have maintained a pledge to bring down annual net migration to Britain to the tens of thousands, from about 258,000. In the period since the Brexit vote, net migration has gradually fallen, fuelled by less EU migrants arriving than in the past. Non-EU migration has, however, risen steadily over the past five years.More than 1 million people of Indian heritage live in the UK. However, the report said skilled workers, students and tourists find the migration system hard to navigate, expensive and unwelcoming.“Facilitating the movement of these groups is inseparable from the goal of increasing trade with India. We are concerned that government policy has been driven by the single-minded objective of reducing net migration,” the report says.Britain has lost ground in attracting Indian students and tourists to other countries, while the UK has plunged from being India’s second-biggest trade partner in 1999 to its 17th.Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, said: “India is an essential partner to the UK. Our relationship and the living bridge of people who link our nations will only become more important.“The government needs to make sure the UK is making its support for India clear, reawakening the ties between us and building bridges that are made to last.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ef73a1de06a0dea1f64e47f5c37e59b8fd54b1d/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=421bed5b0fea9aff31cfdc2268f3deec","title":"irish border kept open within three years after no deal brexit says report","story":"Exclusive: Report on keeping border open, backed by Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, suggests special economic zonesAlternative arrangements for keeping the Irish border open in the event of a no-deal Brexit or the collapse of future trade talks with the EU could be up and running within three years, a report concludes.The interim report by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission will be unveiled at a special conference on the Irish border in London on Monday.Their conclusions suggest that the UK would only need the Irish border backstop contained in the withdrawal agreement until 2022, if work on such arrangements started today.Backed by remain-voting Conservative party MPs Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, the report makes eight interim recommendations following consultation with business, politicians and economic experts, including commercial interests in Northern Ireland.It suggests special economic zones “covering frontier traffic and national security offer potentially valuable solutions” which it said would respect the realities of the border.The report addresses key issues including the vexed question of health checks on any live animals, animal or plant produce crossing the border, including milk, pigs and sheep.The report says “sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS)” tests could be carried out by mobile units away from the border.This would require politicians in the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) to accept checks on farms and in food-production plants and related facilities, something they have opposed so far.Among the other recommendations are the creation of a multi-tier trusted trader programme for large and small companies, with exemptions for small companies.This was proposed by the government in August 2017 and dismissed by the EU.One of the major challenges for the EU and the UK in keeping the border invisible is the issue of standards on food and food processing currently governed by EU regulations.Under mandatory EU rules checks have to be done at the border at special inspection posts with facilities for lab testing and refrigeration to guard against cross-border infection on everything from salmonella to mad cow disease.Morgan and Hands say in the foreword to the report that the interim recommendations reflect the commission’s commitment to find solutions “compatible with any of the potential Brexit outcomes” including the current withdrawal agreement.The report found that any alternative arrangements must recognise “the supremacy of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement” (GFA) and the preservation of the common travel area.They should also recognise the need for a trade policy in the UK that is independent of the EU, and the need to ensure east-west trade flows as easily as possible.The report also states that all future proposals “must be based on consent”, one of the central tenets of the GFA and a recognition of the two heritages in Northern Ireland. Common all-island regimes should continue and where possible “built upon”.Special arrangements such as special economic zones and common SPS regimes could “potentially  not only the island of Ireland” but also Britain with a common rule book, like the Australia-New Zealand Food Safety Area.The report suggests such an arrangement would allow Ireland to break the EU’s common rule book if the UK erged from EU standards and regulations. This would, for instance, apply if the UK decided to do a trade deal with the US enabling chlorinated chicken to enter the country.This, it notes, would need checks in harbours, ports and airports in Northern Ireland to protect the entire island of Ireland, but this should be a decision for the Northern Ireland assembly.This scenario is predicated on Ireland having a side deal with the EU for a common rule book on the two countries and suggests Ireland would have the unilateral power to deviate from this, even though the EU is based on a system of rules that apply to all member states and not just one.Last October the DUP rejected any checks at ports or airports in Northern Ireland, arguing it would cut the region off from the rest of the UK, while the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, struck a similar position saying the government would “never ever allow a border down the Irish Sea”.And last week the government finally released a mapping exercise which showed the extent to which the border issue impacted non-trade issues with 142 issues including healthcare for heart patients.The commission was set up by Prosperity UK, an organisation created in 2017 that describes itself as an independent platform bringing together business, academics and policymakers to look constructively at the UK’s future outside the EU. It said it welcomed the opportunity for feedback so it could “refine” its recommendations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f30c5a5d6a89bef8e2a1bec5483d99acc0abb11/0_92_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d03de3a86f8b280f4b436665a6cb8d","title":"all female mars colony possible using frozen sperm says study","story":"Scientists find frozen sperm exposed to zero-g could go where no man has gone beforeAll-female astronaut crews could reproduce in space without the help of accompanying men, new research suggests.The study found that frozen samples of sperm exposed to microgravity retained similar characteristics to sperm samples kept on the ground, raising hopes that a sperm bank could one day be set up in space to help populate new worlds.This could prove interesting for female astronauts, amid reports that future missions to Mars may involve women-only space crews.Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut, said at a conference in 2017 that there had been an unreleased Nasa report exploring sexual desires of space crew members during potential missions to Mars. Sharman said the report had recommended space crews of the same gender – “all men or all women” – because they have better team cohesion.Findings from the small preliminary study, involving sperm from 10 healthy donors, suggest that “the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth” exists, according to the researchers.The study was presented on Sunday at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology annual meeting in Vienna, Austria.Montserrat Boada, from Dexeus Women’s Health in Barcelona, who presented the research along with her colleagues, said: “Some studies suggest a significant decrease in the motility of a human, fresh sperm sample. But nothing has been reported on the possible effects of gravitational differences on frozen human gametes, in which state they could be transported from Earth to space.”One group of sperm samples used in the study had been exposed to microgravity with the help of a small aerobatic aircraft. The samples then underwent fertility screenings and were analysed for concentration, motility and DNA fragmentation.No significant differences were detected between samples that had been given a ride and those that had stayed on the ground.The researchers said that further work was needed to fully understand the effect of space conditions, such as different levels of gravity, and that sperm would have to be exposed to space-like conditions for longer periods of time.“Our best option will be to perform the experiment using real spaceflight but access is very limited,” Boada said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

Murray, meanwhile, proved beyond doubt his hip is in working order again, vindicating his decision to have a second operation in January, when his career looked over.The former world No 1 – who puts this trophy alongside his five in singles at the Queen’s Club – will continue his perfectly paced recovery at Eastbourne this week, teaming up with the Brazilian Marcelo Melo before changing again the following week at Wimbledon, where he will play alongside Pierre-Hugues Herbert, to the annoyance of the Frenchman’s regular foil Nicolas Mahut. In the strange world of doubles, where faithfulness is next to the door marked Exit, López will play at Wimbledon with Pablo Carreño Busta and not his regular teammate Marc López.Nevertheless, these are three quality doubles champions Murray has chosen, underlining his determination to come back to the game as a winner and not just a curiosity from the past.Murray, who turned 32 last month, plays doubles with such verve, touch and good judgment it becomes more obvious in that setting how toweringly skilful he is. For now he will stick to the discipline but soon enough – perhaps at Cincinnati just before the US Open, the scene of his breakthrough major in 2012 – he will be tempted back to singles. Only then will he know how much he has left. Indications are: quite a lot.He lost his serve in the seventh game, though, as Salisbury found space down the tramlines – but with the help of a double fault by the Londoner they repaired the damage to get back to 5-5, then fell 1-5 behind in the tie-break. Salisbury got his team to set point, Murray saved it on serve, and Ram volleyed wide, handing the frame to the Scot and the Spaniard after 51 minutes.The young contenders stayed in the fight, though, and played some excellent tennis, breaking Murray a second time to level at a set apiece and force the champions’ tie-break. López hit five winners in a row and Murray served out the win at the second time of asking.For López, the cloudy afternoon began in sunshine and optimism as he rode his luck to win his second singles title here, outlasting the Frenchman Gilles Simon, 6-2, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (2) – a performance as memorable for his battle against fatigue as his 16 aces in 2hr 49min.“Stay where you are,” he urged the crowd. “There’s more to come.” How right he was.Over five days and six completed matches, López spent 15hr 26min on Centre Court, a small patch of green in west London that has become his home away from home. The crowd love him, and he endeared himself further when paying tribute to the forbearance of his fiancée, the 23-year-old Spanish model Sandra Gago. “She doesn’t know much about tennis, I have to say,” he said courtside, “but after watching me lose a lot in 2018 at least now she knows I’m not a bad player.”López controlled the first set and seemed on course for a straightforward victory. But he trailed 0-2 in the second and, in a series of tough rallies, had to battle back to force the tie-break, where Simon prevailed.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsIt was a similar story in the third. López had match point after 2hr 40min of a close struggle, but hit a tired forehand into the net and the Frenchman escaped again, taking them into another shootout. This time López held his nerve, ecstatic to be champion again as he revelled in the applause of the packed Centre Court.Not a lot falls in his lap, though. When he beat Marin Cilic to win the title two years ago, he had to fight his way through a third-set tie-break – and his career has been marked by extended endeavour. Nobody in the post tie-break era has played in more five-setters when the score has been deadlocked at 6-6.At Wimbledon last year López passed Roger Federer’s record of 65 consecutive grand slam appearances. As he heads for the All England Club next week, that mark has moved on to 69. López is 38 in September, six weeks younger than the Swiss – not as lauded, but certainly as respected.He is only the third player to win both the singles and doubles titles in the same year at Queen’s Club, after Pete Sampras in 1995 and Mark Philippoussis in 1997."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95ded76138901156be63cd190c19b8b111b380a7/297_106_4314_2588/master/4314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7e0685cdc5ad357c520969aa272a147","title":"lewis hamilton f1 ","story":"• Hamilton: ‘When you say it’s boring – I totally understand’• ‘It’s important to realise it is not the fault of the drivers’Leading the Formula One world championship with another easy win from the front at the French Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton criticised Formula One, the FIA and the sport’s teams as being responsible for the lack of competition in the racing, accusing them of repeatedly making mistakes. Hamilton was adamant that if F1 is to improve the drivers need to be more involved in composing new regulations for the 2021 season.Hamilton led every lap of the race at Circuit Paul Ricard and was not challenged either by his teammate Valtteri Bottas, who was second, or Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc who was third. Hamilton has now won six of the eight grands prix this season and his Mercedes team remain unbeaten. Mercedes have won the drivers’ and constructors’ championships every year since 2014.“When you say ‘it’s boring’ – I totally understand it but don’t point the fingers at the drivers because we don’t write the rules,” Hamilton told journalists. “We should put the pressure on the people that are at the head. I think they are trying but for many, many years they’ve made bad decisions.”Last week the teams met the FIA and F1 to discuss the new regulations in Paris, a meeting Hamilton voluntarily attended to offer his opinions. He has been in F1 since 2007 and driven through a variety of different regulations including a range of tyre and aerodynamic formulae. He was convinced drivers have to be more involved.“Do I have confidence it’s going to shift massively? I have faith it’s going to get better, to the point that I went to Paris last week to get involved. I was in that meeting watching all the bosses of F1 and the FIA and all the teams. I have nothing to gain by it. They’re making all these decisions but never once had a driver’s input in that room so if that can be the decisive point that helps shift it so the fans can get better racing, I’d be proud to be a part of that.”The regulations currently having to be agreed by complex horse trading between the teams, the FIA and F1, with vested interests playing a major part. Hamilton was insistent that fundamental change in the governance of the sport was required."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1ad568ba770b155d48cfc7d63019cf3e9ed1c55/79_196_3469_2081/master/3469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bf4709ce1c12bb7450640f66ebaec48","title":"pakistan south africa cricket world cup match report","story":"Let there be no further ambiguity about it: South Africa are out of the World Cup. They had been hanging on for some 18 days since losing a third straight fixture to begin their ill-fated campaign but a limp loss to Pakistan by 49 runs sealed their fate at last. By contrast, Pakistan, nearly as abject as the Proteas at times across their three losses, move on to Birmingham on Tuesday with hope. They need to run the table against New Zealand, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, but thanks to Haris Sohail’s exhilarating 89 and five wickets shared by Mohammad Amir and Shadhab Khan, their route to the final four remains.It is difficult to avoid comparisons with the three times Pakistan have hoisted global trophies. In each of the 1992 World Cup, 2009 World T20 and 2017 Champions Trophy, they had to reach sudden death in the group stage before taking all before them. Until Sunday Pakistan had won four of their most recent 24 ODIs. And yes, when India annihilated them a week earlier they were public enemies at home. But that means nothing now. They are still alive.Doubly so due to Amir’s one-day resurgence. The left-arm spearhead was not in the original World Cup squad, with just five wickets at an average of 92 since his brilliant Champions Trophy. But not only is Amir ( two for 49) back in the team, he is back to his best. His first delivery to Hashim Amla curved back the way that lives on in the mind’s eye from when he first exploded on to the scene. Shadhab (three for 50) was equally superb, duping Quinton de Kock (47), castling Aiden Markram (7) and ending Rassie van der Dussen’s (36) troubled stay to leave South Africa reeling at 189 for five.As the dark clouds descended on Lord’s, Faf du Plessis’ side demonstrated how far behind the pace they are. The 308 for seven Pakistan posted was not insurmountable on a fresh pitch. South Africa’s batting suggested otherwise, allowing the required run rate to climb to the point where the game was in effect over in the 30th over when the captain top-edged Amir on 63. He was a member of the only partnership of any zest with De Kock, which ended 10 overs earlier.It was also with 20 overs to go in their fielding innings that events took a turn for the worse for the Proteas. They started poorly with the ball after Pakistan won the toss, Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq adding 57 in the first 10 overs. But the introduction of 40-year-old Imran Tahir changed that, the former falling to a premeditated ramp and the latter taken spectacularly in the leg-spinner’s follow-through. Both made 44. The build continued through Babar Azam, but at a medium pace. When Mohammad Hafeez was trapped leg before by part-timer Markram from the final ball of the 30th over, Pakistan had advanced to 143 for three.Enter Sohail. From the start, the classy southpaw was assertive: Du Plessis brought back his talisman Kagiso Rabada to burst open the middle order but Sohail instead drove him to frustration with an uppercut six. The No 5 was scoring with touch as much as muscle as the bowlers chopped and changed. Babar holed out for 69 when they had put on 81 in 68, the stand broken in the 42nd over. They were away.Sohail’s striking only got better when Imad Wasim was elevated up the order, passing 50 from his 38th delivery with a shot that was emblematic of his innings: making room off Chris Morris to carve him behind point for four. An over of Andile Phelukwayo worth 16 raised the 50 partnership in 26 balls the second quickest in this World Cup. When Imad’s cameo (23 off 15) ended, they had put on 78 in 40 progressing Pakistan 295 for five. Sohail top edged Lungi Ngidi’s penultimate ball of the innings, but the job was done.When the meaningful damage was done in South Africa’s reply, it got ugly. Their last hope, David Miller, was bowled by teenage quick Shaheen Afridi, prompting a celebration nearly as elaborate as Tahir’s (two for 41) when he was twirling. Phelukwayo continued on admirably for an unbeaten 46 from 32 balls, watching on as Wahab Riaz bowled Morris, Rabada and Ngidi in quick succession, the chase closing meekly on 259 for nine.The renewed optimism of Sarfaraz’s men will have a knock-on effect for England when they play Australia on Tuesday, also at Lord’s. If they can get straight back on the bike after their shock loss on Friday, it will make Pakistan’s late run irrelevant. If they cannot, this could yet turn into an interesting race to the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c6f532ac55a60f0fb93441f374cb96a6cc6a844/0_160_4841_2905/master/4841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812a313abef867a39de6628586d3e2dd","title":"australian hannah green wins first major at womens lpga championship","story":"Australian Hannah Green won the women’s PGA Championship at Hazeltine, her first victory on the LPGA Tour, to become the first Australian woman since Karrie Webb at the Kraft Nabisco in 2006 to win a major.The 22-year-old from Perth shot a 72 on Sunday for a nine-under total of 207 to win by one shot from defending champion Sung Hyun Park (68) of South Korea.

So it is with ITV’s new six-part drama Beecham House. The first two parts play over consecutive nights – the second episode is on Monday night – which is the equivalent of ripping off a plaster quickly. The remaining parts are to be shown over the following Sunday nights, to let some air get to the wound and hope it heals. Basically, it’s Downton Abbey relocated to late-18th-century Delhi, covering the adventures of John Beecham the man, the chest, the legend. Oh, and the beard. Which, as his mother (played by Lesley Nicol, who was Mrs Patmore the cook in the actual Downton Abbey) notes on her arrival in Delhi after not seeing him for 12 years, “sits handsomely on your face”. That one really should have gone back for an edit.Beecham, his chest, beard and legend are played by Tom Bateman, who looks like a cross between Aidan Turner and Jamie Dornan. I mention this to save you the 20 minutes of squinting distraction that you will otherwise go through before you can work it out and settle. Bateman does the very best he can with the script that, I can only imagine, was thrust at the actors from the wings just before the cameras rolled.Most of the first hour is spent repeatedly establishing Beecham’s anachronistically heroic, or possibly heroically anachronistic, bona fides. If we hear once that he has resigned from the East India Company in protest at its rapacious, colonialist impulses in order to set up as an independent businessman with the good of the oppressed continent at heart, we hear it a thousand times. “I am a fair trader, not a pillager,” Beecham tells the suspicious General Castillon (Gregory Fitoussi, who is also resolutely unfazed by his dismal lines and cipher-character, a mercenary for the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II). “Their expansion plans are shameful,” he announces to the Maharajah he must persuade to grant him a trading licence. “I have severed ties with them.”When Beecham’s old pal Samuel (Marc Warren, as game as the rest of the poor bastards) turns up, having been sacked from the East India Company for giving evidence against it at a trial our hero should have testified at too, he also is assured by Beecham that “Their hypocrisy sickens me!” Out of guilt, Beecham makes him a partner, which may yet turn out to be a wrong move, given that Samuel has reason to resent his friend (“They sullied my name!”) and is, I would remind you, played by Marc Warren – whose CV in its entirety reads “shifty”.No one else has anything much to do. The love interest is a local governess, Margaret Osbourne (Dakota Blue Richards, who was Lyra in the film adaptation of Philip Pullman’s The Golden Compass and no slouch). Her main activity so far is to wander around Beecham’s palatial home (“How nice it must be to sit under this tree!”) and throw into disarray his mother’s plans to marry him off to Violet, the companion she has brought with her from England. Various servants giggle and whisper in corners about the master and the mysterious baby and its attendant whom he has brought with him. “You will learn that I am a private man,” he says, although we viewers are privileged by glimpses of the erotic dreams he has of an Indian woman whose presence he reaches for yearningly as he wakes, only to find his bed empty.As a standard ITV drama it would be risible – a meagre, basic plot being parcelled out by actors constrained by lines that make them sound as if they are giving dictation to a secretary they have every reason not to trust. But as a passion project of the rightly feted director Gurinder Chadha (Bhaji on the Beach, Bend it Like Beckham, Bride and Prejudice) that was touted as a corrective to the tradition of period dramas that prioritise and do not sufficiently problematise the white colonial version of history, it is simply bizarre. So far – and, although I acknowledge that we are just one hour into six, nothing about the series suggests a remarkable deepening or complication of the endeavour is imminent – it is a straightforward white saviour narrative, and unless having white characters who are as underdeveloped as the Indian ones is the equality dreamed of, it is hard to see how any progress has been achieved here at all. As it stands, it’s a jewel in no one’s crown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a40867552a5398219d1a0682f57179b24b93cd30/0_134_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e138832a35d58bda28751688c70ffef","title":"tv tonight what is it like to live in a house you bought for 1","story":"A year on from our first trip to the Webster Triangle in Liverpool, how are the residents coping?

Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible. Your books can go unorganised for a while yet.For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fa64062b972f6b03ea58c6dc5019e1946b89e43/0_819_1432_859/master/1432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08704430ed0c5da2ce6125469d5a7954","title":"air canada woman wakes up alone darkened plane","story":"Air Canada said on Sunday it was looking into how crew members could have disembarked from a plane without noticing a sleeping passenger who was left behind.The airline was responding to an incident involving a woman who described waking up “all alone” on a “cold dark” aircraft after a flight to Toronto earlier this month. “I think I’m having a bad dream bc like seriously how is this happening!!?!” Tiffani Adams recounted in a 19 June Facebook post provided by a friend, Deanna Noel-Dale. The airline confirmed the incident took place but declined to comment on its disembarking procedures or how the passenger may have been overlooked. “We are still reviewing this matter so we have no additional details to share, but we have followed up with the customer and remain in contact with her,” Air Canada said.Adams wrote that after she woke up, she called Noel-Dale to try to explain what happened, but her phone died and she couldn’t charge it because power to the plane was off. She said she was “full on panicking” by the time she found the “walky talky thingys in the cockpit”, which also didn’t work. After no one saw the “SOS signals” she made by shining a flashlight out the window, she unbolted a cabin door. Facing a steep drop to the tarmac, she leaned out of the aircraft and called over a ground crew, who got her out. The passenger wrote that Air Canada personnel asked if she was OK and whether she would like a limo and hotel but she declined the offer. She said airline representatives apologized and said they would investigate. “I haven’t got much sleep since the reoccurring night terrors and waking up anxious and afraid I’m alone locked up someplace dark,” she wrote. Attempts to reach Adams through Noel-Dale’s Facebook account had not received a response by late Sunday morning. Air Canada said in a Facebook response to the post that it was surprised to hear the story and “very concerned”, asking Adams to send a private message with her flight details. “We’ll take a look into it,” the airline wrote.

His father, Rudy Lozano, was an aldermanic candidate in the city in the early 1980s who rallied Mexican and Puerto Rican voters to support Harold Washington, the first African-American mayor. The elder Lozano was shot dead in 1983 in what supporters say was an assassination.“We are united,” Lozano said. “We are determined. We are raring to fight.”Communism has long been regarded with fear in the US, viewed as antithetical to American values and democracy. The US spent much of the 20th century in battle against it, seeking to contain it in Korea, Vietnam and elsewhere, hot wars fought as part of the cold war with the Soviet Union.Decades were spent attempting to root out communism at home, including during the first red scare following the first world war and the second red scare of the 1940s and 1950s, in which Senator Joseph McCarthy led “investigations” to out suspected communists in government and public life. Accusations of communism, as well as socialism, continue to be leveled by conservatives against mainstream liberal politicians, including Barack Obama.But there is also a long history of communism and radical leftwing politics in America, as leaders and attendees pointed out in Chicago.“The story of our communist party is inextricably intertwined with the development of the American working class and building its labor movement,” Lozano said. “Our roots are in the profound American struggles for democracy.”Lozano cited party support for the civil rights and anti-war movements, for battles against police abuse and mass incarceration, and for drastic action to combat climate change including the Green New Deal proposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the faces of the young democratic socialist movement within the Democratic party.To attend the CPUSA convention is in some ways to encounter familiar concerns and ideas. Attendees were animated by issues that 2020 presidential hopefuls have pushed to make part of the Democratic platform, including plans to address climate change, inequality and hawkish foreign policy – as well as opposition to Donald Trump, who has sought to “ide working people”, attendees said.“Our job as communists is to unite people,” Ismael Parra, from Los Angeles, told the .“We’re talking about people being joined together,” said Tere Gonzalez, also from LA.Mainstream liberals would have found other elements of the convention less familiar. In a student center on the campus of University of Illinois Chicago, in a large hall past a Dunkin Donuts and a PNC bank, attendees invariably greeted one another as “comrade”. A few wore apparel bearing a hammer and sickle.The convention began with the entire crowd enthusiastically singing This Land Is Your Land, Woody Guthrie’s classic folk song. And while even some of the most progressive mainstream politicians, Elizabeth Warren among them, have bristled at the “socialist” label, it can be striking to hear Americans openly discuss their support for communism.“Nobody is better at beating red-baiting than the reds,” Tyner joked, suggesting the Communist party could best defeat Republicans in 2020.While Tyner suggested during his speech that the party has differences with Ocasio-Cortez and others of the new wave of democratic socialists, that surge of progressive energy appeared to have emboldened the party and attracted new interest.People’s World, the news outlet affiliated with CPUSA, has seen increased readership this year, editor-in-chief John Wojcik and managing editor CJ Atkins told the convention. Several guests were not members of the party, but at the convention to learn more about it.Timothy Faye, who is not a communist but is interested in leftist causes, came to Chicago from Rhode Island. While many older Americans may have a negative view of communism, he said, younger people like him may be more open to its message.“There’s a leftward shift among young people,” Faye told the . “It’s a reflection of the economic environment people are in.”The party seems to see an opportunity to build.“Together, we will win,” Lozano said, concluding his speech. “Our victory is inevitable. Viva the Communist party USA!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c06fd8a44c0dada2b98d397a4075b4c1a5be555/0_187_3134_1881/master/3134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=585c0574292c4531cf51337b12290445","title":"erdogan faces scrutiny once more as istanbul goes back to the polls","story":"Voters embrace CHP party campaign bridging religious, class and ethnic idesTurkey’s opposition has won a high-stakes rerun of the Istanbul mayoral election, a serious blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and a landmark victory in a country where many feared democracy was failing.Shortly after initial results pointing to a landslide win for the opposition coalition candidate, Ekrem İmamoğlu, emerged on Sunday evening, the candidate of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), Binali Yıldırım, conceded and congratulated his rival.The repeat election, designed to undo İmamoğlu’s narrow surprise win in the 31 March contest, was an unprecedented test for both Turkey’s fragile democratic institutions and Erdoğan’s political future.Yıldırım’s swift concession saved the AKP the embarrassment of watching the vote count add up to a second defeat, but the loss is likely to lead to intense new power struggles inside the coalition government. Opposition parties were jubilant.“We are starting a new page in Istanbul. On this new page, there will be justice, equality, love. Today 16 million Istanbullus have refreshed our belief in democracy,” İmamoğlu told supporters in a televised speech.“I thank them all from my heart. You have shown the world that Turkey still protects its democracy. And we have shown other countries who try to go down the road we were choosing that it is no road at all.”Crowded parties broke out on Istanbul’s main shopping streets and in liberal neighbourhoods.“This has brought people hope,” said Semra Deniz, 35, from the city’s artistic hub, Cihangir. “I came to this neighbourhood six years ago and a lot has changed. Places closed down. I hope the cultural erosion is reversed and people feel free to express themselves again.”Despite blanket pro-government media coverage, İmamoğlu, a previously anonymous local administrator, stunned the country with his narrow win in March. For Erdoğan, the loss of his hometown, where his political career began in the 1990s, was a personal blow.After weeks of AKP appeals, Turkey’s electoral board upheld one complaint regarding ballot counting and annulled İmamoğlu’s victory, sparking outrage even within the ruling party’s ranks, where some feared the board had dented the AKP’s democratic credentials.At polling stations on Sunday both CHP and AKP voters stressed that they wanted the repeat election accepted as final.“Clearly there is some funny business going on here but I don’t know what,” said AKP voter Cihat Içyumaz, 65, who like many Istanbullus cut short his summer holiday to vote. “For me, chaos after this round of elections is the scariest outcome. I just want the candidate who is best for Istanbul to win.”Yıldırım worked hard in the second round of campaigning to close the gap with his rival, reaching out to the party’s base in working class and conservative neighbourhoods, voters who punished the government for Turkey’s economic crisis by staying away in March.However, in both a televised debate with İmamoğlu and in conversations with voters, Yıldırım struggled to explain why the repeat election was necessary.İmamoğlu was embraced by voters for a platform which focused on bringing people together across the city’s religious, class and ethnic ides, and was able to paint his new campaign as a battle for the future of Turkish democracy itself.“Erdoğan has to do some serious house-cleaning in his government and reassess his policy making process to bounce back from this, or the suggestion that this is the beginning of his decline will get louder.”Rumours are already circulating that the second defeat could trigger a snap national election as Erdoğan seeks to oust increasingly fractious elements in his governing coalition.Observers note that İmamoğlu’s mandate is still far from assured: the 2015 general election which saw the AKP lose its majority in parliament was rerun and other charismatic challengers to Erdoğan have been imprisoned or folded under pressure.The AKP still controls 25 of Istanbul’s 39 districts and holds a majority in the municipal assembly, which will make it difficult for İmamoğlu to deliver on campaign promises. The margin of his victory, however, shows that at least in Istanbul there is a strong appetite for change after 16 years of national AKP rule.“People say it takes a long time to build a democracy, but today’s result shows it takes a long time to kill a democracy too. Clearly, Turkey’s democratic structures are incredibly resilient.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db9d052f9bd38d7ec1f46bb1c11c716780bd881/886_857_5030_3018/master/5030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98e1322f4fe81b22f26117d1644129dd","title":"iran may pull further away from nuclear deal after latest sanctions","story":"US president says move will be made on Monday as Iran warns it may step up nuclear activitiesDonald Trump has pledged that Iran’s “absolutely broken” economy will face “major” new sanctions on Monday, as Iran countered it would take further steps to increase its nuclear programme unless Europe does more to shield it from US pressure over the coming fortnight.The US president claimed that Iran wanted to negotiate because of the relentless economic pressure from sanctions. Tehran has so far rejected any talks while sanctions remain, and there was no sign of relief on Sunday. Despite calling off airstrikes that had been planned in reprisal to the downing of a US drone on Thursday, tensions in the Gulf remain high.On Sunday, one person was reported dead and seven wounded in a suspected drone attack on a Abha airport in southern Saudi Arabia. The Houthi movement in Yemen, which is backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the second drone attack on the Abha airport in 10 days, and also claimed to have struck the airport in Jizan, on the south-west Saudi coast.John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, warned Iran not to mistake US prudence for weakness. It was reported that the US carried out a cyber-attack on an organisation linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards suspected of being involved in tracking and attacking tanker traffic and naval deployments in the Gulf. A US official told CNN the US cyber command targeted software that was used to track tankers targeted in attacks in the Gulf of Oman on 13 June.Iranian cyber spies are also said to have extensively used social media, approaching sailors online while pretending to be young women, to mine intelligence on their ships’ movements.Bolton was judged to have lost an inter-agency dispute last week when Trump pulled back from missile strikes on three Iranian military sites. Trump said the US air force was “cocked and loaded” when he decided the estimated civilian death toll of a military action would be a disproportionate response to Iran’s downing of the unmanned drone.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran threatening to resume higher uranium enrichment.John Bolton announces the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force in response to \u0027a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u0027.Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its nuclear deal. The US responds by imposing sanctions on Iran\u0027s metals industry.The EU urges Iran to respect the nuclear deal and says it plans to continue trading with the country despite US sanctions.\u0026nbspThe US says it will move a Patriot missile battery into the Middle East to counter threats from Iran.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast \u0027were subjected to sabotage operations\u0027.Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone. It\u0027s not clear who is behind the attack, but after the initial reports, Donald Trump tweets: \u0027If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Semi-official media in Iran report it has quadrupled production of the low-enriched uranium used for civilian applications. Iran is allowed to enrich uranium, but increased production could lead it to exceed the stockpile limits in the nuclear deal.Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia\u0027s King Salman hosts high-level summits in Mecca. He calls on the international community to use all means to confront Iran and accuses them of being behind \u0027terrorist operations\u0027 that targeted Saudi oil interests.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom\u0027s south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift as 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US \u0027spy\u0027 drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Bolton, speaking in Jerusalem before a three-way conference between the US, Russia and Israel on the future role of Iran in Syria, insisted the US had not lost its nerve.He said no one had granted Iran “a hunting licence in the Middle East”. He echoed Trump’s warnings that the US military was “rebuilt, new and ready to go”, and said “biting” new sanctions would be imposed on Monday.“Iran’s continued pursuit of nuclear weapons, its threats to exceed the limits set in the failed Iran nuclear deal in the coming days … are not signs of a nation seeking peace,” Bolton said.However, back in Washington Trump issued one of his frequent reminders that Bolton does not have the final say in US national security matters, but is just one voice among several competing views.“John Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him he’d take on the whole world at one time, OK? But that doesn’t matter because I want both sides,” Trump told NBC News’s Meet the Press on Sunday. He pointed to the disastrous US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 – a war Bolton aggressively advocated – as a reason for caution in the Middle East.However, the president warned that any more hostile acts by Iran could draw a more forceful military response than the one planned and aborted on Thursday.“So what happened is I said, ‘I’m not going to do it. I’ll save it. If they do something else, it’ll be double’,” Trump told NBC, adding that he would continue to ramp up sanctions.“We are putting major additional sanctions on Iran on Monday,” Trump tweeted.In his NBC interview he added: “I think that they want to negotiate. I don’t think they like the position they’re in. Their economy is, is absolutely broken.”As he has done on almost every occasion he has discussed Iran, Trump offered direct talks with “no preconditions” focused on Iran’s nuclear programme.He said he told Shinzō Abe, before the Japanese prime minister visited Tehran on 12 June: “Send the following message: you can’t have nuclear weapons. And other than that, we can sit down and make a deal. But you cannot have nuclear weapons.”On further questioning he added the demand that Tehran should not have a ballistic missile programme, and suggested he wanted a tougher inspection regime.Iran has said it does not want to acquire nuclear weapons and has agreed not to do so under the non-proliferation treaty. Until now, it has stuck to the limits on its nuclear programme agreed in a 2015 multilateral deal, which Trump withdrew the US from last May and has since tried to destroy.Faced with a US-imposed oil embargo and a web of other sanctions, Iran has warned in recent months that it will cease to abide by some elements of the 2015 agreement.It is allowing stocks of low-enriched uranium to build up, and President Hassan Rouhani has warned that if Europe does not do more to shield Iran from US sanctions by a 8 July deadline, it will take the much more significant step of increasing its uranium enrichment levels, bringing it closer to weapons grade.On Sunday, the head of Tehran’s strategic council on foreign relations suggested Iran could further raise the stakes.Speaking after meeting the British Middle East minister, Andrew Murrison, in Tehran, Kharazi said Europeans should provide capital for the special trading vehicle designed to enable European trade with Iran and circumvent US sanctions. Accusing Europe of failing to deliver on its promises, he said: “One should see whether Europe is making empty promises or taking practical steps in the two weeks that remain until the deadline.”European solidarity in support of the 2015 nuclear deal and resistance to the drift towards conflict may be affected by the current Conservative Party contest to replace Theresa May as the UK’s prime minister. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and one of the two contenders for the top job, said the UK could support the US in a conflict with Iran, depending on the circumstances.“We will stand by the United States as our strongest ally but of course we have to consider any requests for military support on a case-by-case basis,” Hunt said while campaigning in Scotland, according to the Daily Mail. “We want to de-escalate the situation but we are of course extremely worried.”The UK has its own points of friction with Iran. On his visit to Tehran, Murrison raised the plight of the Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is on hunger strike in a Tehran jail. She is serving a five-year sentence for espionage, a charge she denies.Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, is on a sympathy hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London. A stream of well-wishers have been to visit him, including Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson.

Gone are the days when couples would be satisfied with a single black and white photo to commemorate their weddingChinese couples used to be satisfied with a single black and white photograph taken on their wedding as a memento of their special day. But times have changed dramatically, and the wedding photographs, especially pre-wedding photo sessions, have become big business in China.In the main touristic spots in different cities across China, it is easy to see couples having their pre-wedding photoshoots, which become the must-have for every Chinese couple before their marriage. Unlike western weddings, where couples usually have their photos taken on their wedding day, for Chinese people it is quite popular to have their day-long photo sessions way before their actual weddings. Sometimes it can be half a year or even a year in advance of the ceremony.Some couples even choose other countries for their pre-wedding sessions. Often for their photoshoots couples go for traditionally romantic cities such as Paris.Those who can’t afford such a trip to have pre-wedding photos with the Eiffel Tower can have their photo taken in front of Chinese replicas of the main world’s tourist sites.Other couples prefer more traditional outdoor locations, like Beijing’s Hutong neighbourhood, or to be surrounded by nature like in Dali, where lots of couples do their pre-wedding photography next to Lake Erhai.These sessions can range in price from a few hundred up to thousands of dollars, with companies providing clients with everything from outfits to makeup and transportation. Brides typically have at least three dress changes per shoot. Inspired by the traditional western style, many choose a flowing white wedding dress, a Chinese-style red gown, and something more modern.The shoots are just one part of a booming industry in China. A wedding for most newly married couples can run from 50,000 yuan (£5,700) to 200,000 yuan, with larger amounts not uncommon in big cities like Beijing or Shanghai. China’s wedding industry was valued at 1.46tn yuan in 2017, and it is expected to grow to 3tn yuan by 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f47d7503ee3227e035714b04abcee3b61ece0870/99_293_3401_2040/master/3401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=282369bb2b2ce5f41918489a6657574b","title":"french call for referendum macron airports sell off","story":"President accused of ‘flogging family silver’, as communists and Sarkozy MPs join forcesEmmanuel Macron’s plan for the biggest wave of French privatisations in a decade is under threat after opposition politicians took the unusual step of joining ranks to push for a referendum on the sale of Paris airports.The centrist French president wants to sell the state’s controlling stake in Aéroports de Paris, the profitable operator of Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, which are used by more than 100 million passengers each year. It would be among the biggest privatisation operations in French history, alongside Macron’s plans to sell other stakes in the national lottery as well as the gas and power group ENGIE.The privatisation on the Paris airports is a crucial part of Macron’s modernisation plans for the French economy. A source close to the president said the state was not best qualified to run airport shopping and, with Charles de Gaulle ranked low for passenger experience, private managers could improve that. Profit from the sale – expected to be more than €7bn (£5.5bn) – would be redirected into a new investment fund for startup companies and technology, and would also help plug the national debt.But political opponents accuse Macron of “flogging the family silver” and letting go of strategic state infrastructure. They say the UK, with its privatised Heathrow airport and privatised railways, illustrates a potential nightmare scenario of key transport infrastructure run for profit.“It would be the first time the people would be able to decide on such a massive issue of privatisation,” said Laurent Russier, the communist mayor of Saint-Denis, north of Paris. At a time when gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government protesters have called for more of a say in politics, and Macron has promised to listen more to citizens, a potential referendum is a test for French politics.A race is now under way to gather the 4.7m signatures. “It will be extremely difficult but not entirely impossible,” said one campaigner, urging French voters from all regions and living abroad to sign. At least 17,000 signatures would be needed per day, but the government online platform for people to sign up is seen as difficult to use and prone to crashing. More than 200,000 people are estimated to have signed up since 13 June.This week, the first public meeting to garner support was held in a crowded trade union building in Saint-Denis. In the French capital’s northern suburbs, Charles de Gaulle airport is a key employer. There were unusual scenes, with communist-voting trade unionists waving flags and applauding rightwingers whom they once would have jeered.“The public interest comes first,” said Eric Coquerel of the hard-left party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), arguing that it was not an anti-Macron political game, but a drive to protect state infrastructure. Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally was not invited to join the group, but she has urged her supporters to sign up to reach the 4.7m target.On the right, politicians said Macron was using the same arguments as the Thatcher government over Heathrow’s privatisation in the 1980s – that there would be “better services provided for airline passengers”. Gilles Carrez, a rightwing lawmaker, said: “Many major airports have stayed under state control. The obvious exception is Heathrow and today the British regret the privatisation of Heathrow.”“Pollution,” shouted a woman in the crowd, concerned over airport expansion like Heathrow’s third runway. The historian Patrick Weil said: “We’re in a third world war against the climate crisis, a battle which should be mobilising all of humanity. Selling Aéroports de Paris to the private sector is like handing arms to our enemy.”The recent months of gilets jaunes demonstrations have highlighted privatisation in France – particularly the private companies which run French motorways. Last autumn, gilets jaunes protesters blockaded scores of motorway toll booths around the country, expressing anger at the rise in toll prices since privatisation in 2005.Not everyone agrees. Gérard Lacher, a member of Les Républicains and head of the Senate, said the referendum drive amounted to a hijacking of democracy.Among those who have already signed the petition for a referendum, Michel (surname withheld), 80, said: “A referendum is a good thing because I don’t trust politicians. The people should decide.”Danielle (surname withheld) said: “Selling off Paris airports is one privatisation too far. We’ll end up looking like Britain in a Ken Loach film.

Photograph: Anthony DevlinPAA report into the failure of a senior hospital consultant at St Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny, to obtain consent before carrying out gynaecological “exploratory work” on women patients is under consideration by Ireland East Hospital Group.Obstetrician and gynaecologist Prof Ray O’Sullivan says he did not feel he needed to obtain consent before carrying out tests on five women patients last year. The hospital maintains he should have obtained consent, has sought his suspension and has reported the matter to the Medical Council. The tests were stopped last September after nursing staff raised concerns over whether the required consents had been obtained from a regional hospital ethical committee and from the patients themselves.The tests, which were carried out by junior staff unaware there was an issue with consent, involved flushing the vaginas of the women with water, inserting a miniature scope for monitoring, and measuring the pressure within the vagina. The equipment involved, including tubes and pressure gauges, was brought in from outside the hospital.Investigation of symptomsThe women involved had been referred to the hospital for investigation of their symptoms.Speaking to The , Prof O’Sullivan said the issue “had more to do with preliminary, exploratory work – as to whether you need consent for that before you engage in an actual clinical trial. It was more technical than anything else.”Asked if he felt he needed consent, he replied: “I felt I didn’t need consent. I didn’t because we weren’t actually doing the research. We were just seeing if a particular procedure that we were planning on doing as part of the research could be done.”Tests stoppedOnce the issue became know, the hospital stopped the tests and informed the patients, who were told investigations into the matter would be completed within weeks.The hospital commissioned a report from Prof Peter Doran, a scientist at UCD’s school of medicine, which was critical of the failure to secure consent.Ireland East Hospital Group then commissioned a second report. Prof O’Sullivan said he was sure that report would say “that’s fine, fire ahead with the research but just get the ethical approval going forward for the actual research”.A spokeswoman for the hospital group said its chief executive Mary Day had “only received the report on Friday and hasn’t had a chance to review it”.Asked whether an apology would be made to the women affected, she replied she had “nothing further to say”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Anthony Moynihan was sentenced in his absence to seven years for rape of 11-year-old boyAttendees at international cycling conference Velo-City say political courage is neededDeath of Manus Kelly, FF councillor and business man, described as \u0026lsquoan immeasurable loss\u0026rsquoDublin City Council has put forward a plan for a \u0026euro10m traffic-free College Green plazaCentral Bank sends letter notifying that unauthorised selling would be criminal offenceObstetrician and gynaecologist\u0026rsquos work on new speculum raises bodily autonomy issuesKilkenny hospital referred matter to Medical Council and sought suspension of doctorForged email to Barnier purports to show DUP leader\u0026rsquos support for EU\u0026rsquos Brexit positionDisinformation campaign believed to be first co-ordinated effort targeting Irish isionsInternational panel raises concerns over financial viability of applicationSherborough Enterprises wants to replace only private owner on the boardLifeline Inishowen to hand 1,000-signature petition to D\u0026aacuteil in search for urgent fundingDavis (22), killed in suspected drug-related attack, was with his infant son at the timeHelsinki Commission three-day trip also linked to social issues in Northern IrelandManagers accept invite to discuss credit card spending, Brexit and cruise-ship businessIrish Human Rights and Equality Commission also notes unfairness to asylum seekersBenefit to children for the first time now over \u0026euro600, with girls getting more than boysRemaining renters say people who already left homes did so on foot of invalid noticesCritics of the system point to low graduation rates, although others cite hidden benefits"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3934928.1561299339!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"college green traffic ban for three summer sundays to test plaza plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA architect’s image of the proposed College Green plaza.College Green in Dublin city centre will be traffic-free for three days this summer, the business representative group Dublin Chamber has confirmed.In a tweet it said College Green, the area in front of the Bank of Ireland, would be pedestrianised on Sunday July 21st, Sunday July 28th and Sunday August 4th.The aim is to test the popularity of a car-free plaza at College Green. A programme of family events are planned on these days to encourage people into the city centre.The council is expected to reapply for permission for the plaza in the coming months.The board last November rejected the pedestrian and cycle plaza scheme due to concerns about the “significantly negative impacts” it would have on bus transport and traffic in the city.ApplicationThe council intends to lodge a fresh application to the board by the middle of this year. However, its head of traffic management Brendan O’Brien said it was unlikely the plaza proposals would change.“An Bord Pleanála themselves in their judgment, and in the inspectors report, found the plaza was a good idea. Architecturally there were no real issues with it,” he said. “The issues were the knock-on consequences of the plaza rather than anything to do with the plaza itself.”In its ruling last November the board said “the principle of the proposed development is acceptable” and that it would produce a “quality public realm” and would “facilitate improved appreciation of the architectural and cultural heritage of this important site”.However, it would not give permission because of the traffic implications for the city, particularly on buses.The board said there was “uncertainty” about the potential effects on the bus system, but they were likely to be “significantly negative in the light of the scale of rerouting of buses proposed, the critical importance of bus transport to the city, and its future role in facilitating modal shift from public car usage, in line with national policy”.It criticised the traffic analysis done by the council and was not satisfied it was “sufficient to accurately quantify the traffic impacts of the proposed development and the magnitude of those impacts”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3935168.1561324307!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"developer of defective apartments proposes family members for board","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCearbhall Beggan, the only private owner and volunteer director on the board of the Cathedral Court OMC. Photograph: Aidan CrawleyThe developer of a Dublin 8 apartment block with serious building defects has proposed that hotelier Noel O’Callaghan and his son Charles O’Callaghan replace the only private owner on the board of the owners’ management company (OMC).The  recently revealed that Sherborough Enterprises, a development company controlled by members of the family that owns the O’Callaghan hotel group, expects apartment owners at Cathedral Court in Dublin 8 to pay more than €5,000 each to repair building defects in an apartment block that it built and still partly owns.A building surveyor’s report found problems with a large number of balconies at the site in 2016, while a fire-safety survey last year also found shortcomings.Cearbhall Beggan is the only private owner and volunteer director on the board of the Cathedral Court OMC the only other director is Paul O’Callaghan, son of Noel and director of Sherborough.Mr Beggan has continuously questioned the rationale behind charging private owners for the remediation work rather than pursuing the developer first, but his efforts have been stymied by Sherborough, which still owns a majority of apartments in the block and so retains a majority vote on the board of the OMC.In April 2019, Mr Beggan was chairman of an extraordinary general meeting where he blocked a vote that would introduce a €5,300 defects levy on every apartment owner.Mr Beggan also blocked a vote proposing Charles O’Callaghan, brother of Paul, be added as a director of the OMC.It was only after this egm was held, when both votes were blocked, that Sherborough requested Mr Beggan be removed from the board of the OMC.In a letter, issued to all owners on May 16th last, the company said it wished to “express our complete displeasure with the performance of the board of the OMC for Cathedral Court” and that “we feel our rights as a member of the OMC are being suppressed”.Letter to solicitorPaul O’Callaghan also recently wrote to the solicitor appointed to represent the OMC telling him that he will seek to have him removed as the appointed solicitor.Mr O’Callaghan also told solicitor William Brennan that Sherborough would not agree to mediation in order to try to resolve the issue.Mr Beggan told The  that “after years of showing little interest here, no fewer than three of the O’Callaghan family have nominated themselves to join the OMC board”.He raised concerns about the contacts the company had made with the solicitor for the OMC and also about the developer’s role within the OMC.On June 4th a letter was sent to owners notifying them of an egm where they would be asked to vote on removing Mr Beggan from the board of the OMC and electing new directors.The  understands that Sherborough has nominated Noel and Charles O’Callaghan, while four private owners have also put their names forward in order to represent the interests of ordinary apartment owners.Sherborough was contacted for comment by The  but did not respond.There will be a vote on these special resolutions at the egm on Tuesday, June 25th.Noel O’Callaghan is head of The O’Callaghan Collection, a hotel group that includes The Alex, The Green, The Davenport and The Mont hotels in Dublin as well as the Tamburlaine in Cambridge and The Eliott in

If it was an Islamic state, I wouldn\u0027t have left.The main reasons I left the so-called Islamic State is because they started to kill people I know them personally that are Muslims.I had a group of about 20 friends that all left the so-called Islamic State. They all left at one time. One by one, they started to kill them.Jack Letts in Raqqa, SyriaLetts said that he was caught as he tried to escape the border into Turkey after expecting safe passage through Al Nusra-Front territory.He said: They would help us leave. They would get us a smuggler.

She said she was full on panicking by the time she found the walky talky thingys in the cockpit, which also didn’t work.After no one saw the sos signals she made by shining a flashlight out the window, she unbolted a cabin door. Facing a steep drop to the tarmac, she leaned out of the aircraft and called over a ground crew, who got her out.The passenger wrote that Air Canada personnel asked if she was OK and whether she would like a limo and hotel, but she declined the offer. She said airline representatives apologised and said they would investigate.I haven’t got much sleep since the reoccurring night terrors and waking up anxious and afraid I’m alone locked up someplace dark, she wrote.Air Canada said in a Facebook response to the post that it was surprised to hear the story and very concerned, asking Adams to send a private message with her flight details.We’ll take a look into it, the airline wrote.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

1030 want have kids men told following new study linking","story":"Between seven and a half and eight hours sleep is ideal, the study saysMen should get to bed before 10.30pm to improve their chances of fathering children, scientists have said following a groundbreaking new study.The data showed that those tucked up early had nearly four times greater sperm quality compared to those who went to sleep at 11.30 or later.Fertility experts said they believe a lack of sleep provokes the immune system into overreacting and attacking healthy sperm.It also puts men under physical and psychological stress, which is thought to further damage their chances of conceiving.The team at Aarhus University in The Netherlands said the findings are increasingly significant in the age of Netflix where people tend to binge-watch television late into the night.How to | Get a good night’s kipThey studied 104 men with an average age of 34 over a two-year period, tracking their sleep patterns and comparing them against the results of sperm sample analysis.The figures showed that even the difference between getting to sleep before 10.30 and between 10.30 and 11.30 yielded a 2.75-times greater healthiness of sperm.Presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology conference in Vienna, the study contributes to a growing shift in focus towards the impact of substandard sperm in couples’ infertility, a factor scientists now believe has been underestimated for years.Professor Hans Jakob Ingerslev, who co-authored the study, said: “The reasons could be psychological as sleep-deprived men suffer more stress and that can have an impact on fertility.“These were men who had been trying to have a baby for about two years and an early bedtime was likely to be important because it allowed them to get more sleep.”As well as investigating the time at which aspiring fathers went to sleep, the team also assessed sleep duration against the health of the participants’ sperm.They found that between seven and a half and eight hours sleep was ideal.The sperm of men who slept this length appeared to be more than six times healthier than that of those who got less than seven hours.However, no link was found between sperm health and sleeping for eight hours or longer.Dr Christopher Barratt, professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Dundee, said: “If you don’t get enough sleep, that has an impact on the metabolism, which will have a negative effect on sperm quality.He added: “It is pretty basic advice but a lack of sleep is closely tied to feeling stressed and stressed men are also less likely to have sex once a day, as we recommend when trying for a baby.”The new research follows a recent study from Imperial College London, which discovered that the sperm of infertile men is every bit as healthy as that of fertile men while it is still in the testicles.However, by the time it has travelled through a series of ducts and left the body it has become damaged, suggesting something toxic is happening along its path to the outside.It is thought discovery offers new hope for men who struggle to become fathers even with the help of IVF.Beecham House, episode 1, review: An ambitious drama with a worryingly wooden heroBoris Johnson still planning to live with Carrie Symonds in Downing Street despite rowBoris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt:

They feel Hunt is the ideal opponent.He voted Remain in , he has been in Cabinet throughout Theresa May’s premiership with its Brexit failures and he is a mild-mannered figure who struggles to impose himself on debates.One Boris backer jokes that they have never seen, “a more lop-sided two-horse race”.The Hunt campaign bristle at the idea that this is going to be a walkover.They believe he has a route to victory by playing on Tory members’ concerns about whether Boris can actually do the job of being PM.They also think they will do well with the large Scottish membership — Scots are twice as likely to be members of the Tory party than the English — and are planning an early campaign trip there.They expect to pick up the endorsement of Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives.But for all Jeremy Hunt’s efforts to make this a contest, it is still Boris Johnson’s to lose. Of course, he could. He could make a spectacular gaffe or some scandal could blow up.Last night’s revelations of the screaming match at the flat he shares with his new partner shows the scrutiny that his le is going to come under.If he can get through the next fortnight without any major blunders, he’ll become Tory leader.Why  Because the postal votes go out from July  and most Tory members willthem within two days.As one Tory veteran explains: “A week after the ballots have gone out, it is too late to change anything.”I understand Boris will use the next weeks to set out his Brexit position in more detail.Those hoping to see him in full entertainer mode at these hustings will be disappointed. Instead, he intends to stick to the serious persona of the past few weeks.One of those preparing him for the month tells me that Tory members “know he can do Boris. They need to see him do Prime Minister.”This new, more serious approach won’t stop the attacks.Boris’s critics have lost their judgement and want to attack him as a homophobe, despite the fact he was one of the first politicians to back gay marriage. Just as absurdly, they want to smear him as a racist.Oddly, these attacks actually create a problem for Jeremy Hunt.The more ridiculous the criticism Boris faces, the more Tory activists will rally to him. This will make it harder for Hunt to get a hearing for his far more measured criticisms of Boris.All of these hustings will be broadcast on the internet. I understand the Boris campaign were not best pleased about this, which suggests they still have some concerns about their candidate slipping up.But even in this age of political upsets, it is hard to believe that Boris Johnson won’t be the winner of this contest.EDDIE Lister is to run the transition team that will prepare Boris Johnson’s governing programme.Lister, chief of staff for Boris when he was Mayor of London, will take charge of this process and the working assumption is that having done this, he will move to No as chief of staffBoris becomes PM.Crucially, Boris knows and trusts Lister. In his successful stint at City Hall, Lister showed that he knew how to bring order to Boris world – which is no mean feat.One of those close to the decision tells me: “Boris has made the biggest shout, who is your number one man  It is Eddie.” The need for order is urgent.If Boris enters Downing Street, he’ll only have  days until October , the day by which he has promised Britain will be out of the EU. He won’t have any time to lose.Intriguingly, I understand that Sajid Javid – who was knocked out of the leadership race on Thursday – was interested in doing this role.But the Johnson camp wanted whoever ran the transition to become the Downing Street chief of staff. A key challenge for Lister will be to make sure there is a clear structure.Boris has always liked having multiple sources of advice.As one of those who has known him for years observes: “There are going to be lots of dferent courts, lots of people competing for the monarch’s ear – and he quite likes that.”But this source warns that, “as a recipe for government, it could be quite fractious”.It is Lister’s job to make sure there is a clear chain of command.I understand that the spoilt ballot papers weren’t covered in graffiti, but simply left blank.“THE problem is the ,” says one of those preparing Boris for government.The  is a reference to those Tory MPs who voted for Rory Stewart before his elimination from the leadership contest.If only a fraction of this group decides to try to bind Boris Johnson’s hands on Brexit, then the Government could collapse.One of Boris’s closest allies warns that, “It is going to be really problematic, there is going to be a Remainer counterweight to the ERG”, the group of hardline Brexiteer MPs.To the alarm of Boris’ allies, Rory Stewart is uninterested in serving in a Boris Cabinet. Instead, he is setting himself up as an alternative voice on the backbenches.Stewart and his supporters have to remember, though, that a Corbyn government would be worse for this country than any Brexit outcome.The problem for Boris Johnson is that his Brexit strategy relies on MPs giving him time to seehe can use the threat of No Deal to winkle a concession out of the EU.The only chance of these  MPs giving him this time isthey think it is a bluff.“They have to believe it is a bluff, the ERG have to believe it is for real,” con- cedes one Boris ally.Pulling this off is going to be a political high-wire act.BORIS Johnson and Michael Gove have spoken since Gove’s elimination.I’m told the conversation wasn’t substantive but wasn’t rancorous, despite the tactical voting by Johnson supporters that led to Gove being knocked out.In the next few weeks Gove will get on with departmental business. He’ll introduce “Natasha’s law” for clearer labelling of allergens in products, named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret sandwich, and increased sentences for those who abuse animals.I am told that it is “not settled one way or the other” whether Prime Minister Boris would keep Gove at the Environment department or offer him a bigger job. But given the scale of the challenges facing theTories, it would be foolish to not put their most talented departmental minister in one of the great offices of state.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys. I don’t blame them.I cannot believe someone would be so inconsiderate to fellow professionals.I was, however, more aghast at finding out Cary isn’t a spotty teenage geek, but a -year-old man.Surely he should have outgrown PlayStation by now – especially when he is already in charge of the world’s best video game, involving Aston Martin car chases, shootouts, beautul women and dastardly villains.WILLIAM and Kate showed how royals should react when their lestyle causes harm to a member of the public.Widow Irene Mayor, , was hit by a police motorbike escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle. She is in hospital with serious injuries.As soon as Wills and Kate found out, they sent flowers and a hand-written note and have told Irene’s family they want to visit her whenever she is ready.I HAVE never watched Love Island. So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st. But I’m so glad she lost weight gradually with a healthy eating plan and doing exercise she loves.I wish Alison all the best with her battle towards being happier, healthier and fitter and I know she will have helped other women with their weight issues too.I BLOODY love Matt Lucas. The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them. Kylie’s gold gear might make a comeback when she plays Glastonbury next Sunday.And  years after their debut, nobody has ever developed an allergy to them.As the wolf evolved into the dog, it sussed that making its eyes bigger made the humans go all soft and gooey inside.Dr Juliane Kaminski, of the University of Ports- mouth, says: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. It seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.”Those puppy-dog eyes are designed to make your heart melt.Certainly when Stan, our Cavalier King Charles spaniel, looks at me with his enormous, big round peepers, I understand the three little words he is trying to say.Give. Stan. Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it will be an outrageANY of society’s most vulnerable people are dragged to court and punished.If the Government will not scrap the licence fee entirely, the BBC must cut executive salaries and waste, reduce its services and relent over old folk.If it won’t, its power must be limited to cutting off services, like an energy firm does as a last resort, and only then the live TV or iPlayer the licence covers.Luckily there’s plenty more now to watch."},{"url":null,"title":"lingerie thief shop window","story":"The woman dropped her clothes and put on a pinched bra and knickers before putting her togs back on over the top, cops said.But she had no idea a packed crowd had gathered outside the department store in central Manchester and was watching her every move.A pair of officers watched the charade unfold and nicked the woman after alerting the store.A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: “In a bizarre end to Manchester Day a short time ago a woman has allegedly stripped in Harvey Nichols, put lingerie on then put her clothes over the top in an attempt to steal said lingerie.“I can only assume she did not know she was doing this in front of a nd floor window.“Two of our officers attention was been drawn by hundreds of people cheering so they’ve looked up and seen this crime in progress, alerted the store and detained the woman.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When she was little, Freya Williams, from Plymouth, suffered with severe back pain but wanted to eventually join the British Army, so she pushed through the pain and continued to train for the forces. Freya went on to pick the appropriate A-Levels and was well on her way to achieving her le-long dream. But her hopes were shattered after a visit to the doctor in October last year, which led to her being diagnosed with a number of health conditions.   The -year-old now relies on a wheelchair and cannot be left alone as she suffers between  and  seizures a day, which led to her having to abandon her studies, , reports PlymouthLive .But despite this set-back, Freya remains positive and wants to raise awareness of hidden health conditions and even hopes to write a book to inspire other unwell teenagers.    Freya has al neurological disorder , non-epileptic attack disorder , postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome , hyper-mobility syndrome, chronic fatigue and scoliosis. She said the long list of conditions have caused ious mental health issues as well, but the teen hopes by speaking out she will help other people who are going through a similar situation. The former Heleaposs School pupil said: I have suffered horric back pain for around three years and in October I got diagnosed with scoliosis. This is a curvature of the spine, so my spine is the shape of a aposc’.    This was pretty tough to deal with as my le long dream was to join the army, but I continued to train for the forces and and do my A-levels. Freya also has many allergies and after her GP tried her on a neuropathic pain killer called Duloxetine, she ended up severely ill and was paralysed from the waist down for around  days. She continued: I also had very little movement on my upper body. I was like a young child, I had to be fed, showered, carried. I felt like I’d lost everything. After  days I got discharged from the hospital after finally walking with a lot of aid. But around a week later, Freya was back in hospital, paralysed again, when she got another diagnosis. She was told she had FND and NEAD, which Freya said canapost really be fixed other than having intensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation, which often has no guarantee that you will be able to get back to the way you were prior to getting sick. Freya said when she goes to bed at night, she doesnapost know which part of her body she will be unable to move the following day, which sometimes makes it dficult to carry out daily activities, such as eating.    She said: Living with FND means that when I go to bed I’m the evening I don’t know which part of my body won’t work the next day - so I often can’t swallow foods, I struggle with walking and I went from being army fit to using a wheel chair when I leave the house. Freya also gets memory loss, constant nausea, joint pain and other debilitating symptoms due to the condition.Freya said due to her POTS, which causes her to faint due to her heart rate being really high and her blood pressure being really low, that she recognises dferent places by what the ceiling looks like.The teenager has spent around two months in Derrord Hospital so far this year and for many of those weeks she has been in a state of paralysis. Freya has praised the phenomenal health care professionals that look after her during her stays. She said: I’ve had to leave my job and my education and basically put everything on hold. As a result of all of these conditions I now suffer very badly with chronic fatigue along with a lot of mental illnesses that are very dficult to cope with. The NHS and Livewell staff are just so phenomenal and it is safe to say that without them I would probably still be in a state or paralysis. This and amazing support from my wonderful family and close friends. Since I have gotten sick my le has been turned around. But I now see the world in a new light and I have become a person that I am proud to be.    When you are chronically ill you can wake up some days and not see the point of le anymore, and I think it is so acceptable to feel that way because it sucks, and I feel like that a lot, but I am trying to channel my illness into a positive thing. I met some wonderful NHS staff that inspired me to go into nursing. I have also found an inner voice since getting ill. I am so passionate about raising awareness for chronic illnesses and mental illness and sharing the passivities of my experiences and what I have learnt this year. I try to stay as positive as I can, it’s inevitable to have the bad days and to not be OK all of the time. There is no amount of medicine that is going to make you happy, you’ve got to just try and stay positive and stay upbeat and do everything that you can to make it feel a little bit better and a little bit easier.

And it shows % believe Islamist terrorists reflect a widespread hostility to Britain amongst the Muslim community.The , Tory members are the sole electorate whoaposll decide between Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson to choose the next Prime Minister.   Matthew McGregor, Hope Not Hate’s campaigns director said: “From the grassroots to the great offices of state, Conservative members buy into racist myths, with almost half unwilling to have a Muslim Prime Minister – and only % being proud to have one – and most denying that there’s even an issue to confront.” In an open letter to both candidates, Hope Not Hate have demanded they publicly acknowledge the problem and set up an independent investigation to tackle it. The letter reads: “There appears to be a serious problem with Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Evidence compiled by the Muslim Council of Britain and others shows a systemic issue within the party that affects it at every level – from the Cabinet, to council chambers, to the grassroots.  Urging both candidates to make a public commitment to tackling the issue, the letter reads: “This issue will not disappear on its own – it cannot be wished away. Islamophobia in the party can only be rooted outthe party leadership commits to taking concrete action to do so.” It also calls on the party to agree to and publish a definition of Islamophobia. Closing the letter, Hope Not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles adds: “It is time for the next leader of the Conservative Party, and this country, to show real leadership and tackle the issue of Islamophobia within your party. HOPE not hate is on hand to be a partner in this work” The Tory party has been hit by damaging allegations of Islamophobia and has been criticised by senior Muslim Tory politicians for failing to call it out.

But the poll shows that just % of Tory members think there is a problem with Islamophobia in the party - and a massive % donapost believe there is a problem at all.It comes after Home Secretary Sajid Javid got all his leadership rivals to endorse an inquiry into the anti-Muslim racism in the Tory party should they win the contest.YouGov polled  British adults, all Conservative Party members, between June  and June .

Jo Stevens, the Secretary of the Trade Union Group of Labour MPs and a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: Labour is moving to giving the people the final say on Brexit and campaigning to stay. “This is the right thing to do for our economy, jobs and our internationalist outward-looking trade union and Labour values. “But Labour’s official position is still too far behind that of our party members and voters, not to mention grassroots trade unionists who are the bedrock of our movement.”  Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour would back a public vote on any Brexit deal, a move senior Labour figures described as a staging post towards a more explicit policy. But Labour MPs in Leave seats have been resisting the partyaposs push to a second referendum. One, Caroline Flint, said today it was pretty clear  Labour MPs would vote against any push for a second referendum in Parliament. She said she was still optimistic Parliament could reach a deal adding: The health of the nation needs us to agree a deal and move on. Askedshe would vote for a no-deal Brexit or staying in the EU, Ms Flint told BBCaposs The Andrew Marr Show: I wonapost be voting to revoke Article . Pressed on whether that meant she would back a no-deal Brexit, Ms Flint said: If that is where we end up, that is where I will be. Unite questioned the findings of the poll.

Yet, should Johnson enter No in the last week of July, he’d find girlfriend Carrie Symonds isn’t alone in screaming “get off me” – as he possesses no workable plan or public mandate. Labour chief whip Nick Brown is telling his party MPs to expect an election this autumn – either forced by Jeremy Corbyn winning a no confidence vote in the House of Commons or by despairing Johnson gambling at the polls.  Other senior Labour figures speculate Johnson might be tempted to pitch himself as “The People” versus a paralysed Parliament in order to ert attention from his latest Brexit lies. The noisy fight inside his lover’s flat erted from scrutiny of Johnson’s continued ignorance or mendacity – as the £, a week fibber-in-chief of three years ago continues to invent Brexit unicorns. Stupidly believing or pretendingthat a trade tax-free transition period would applyBritain left Europe without a deal by Halloween shows treacherous ignorance. Bank of England governor Mark Carney masterfully destroyed Johnson’s equally fraudulent claim that an obscure Gatt  mechanism would sustain no-deal free trade with our valuable neighbours.    Johnson’s lies feed the blind zealotry of an ageing Tory, southern Brextremist, obsessive sect poised to inflict a similarly deluded PM on the country Fanatics for whom a signicantly damaged economy, destroyed Great Britain and even a wrecked Tory Party are considered prices worth paying. If Brexit kamikaze Johnson makes it to Downing Street, he’ll find the flat that millions of people are shouting they want him to get out of is the apartment over No, rather than that of his partner in South London’s trendy Camberwell district.

Pairs of people matched by our ground-breaking Britain Talks project met across the political ide and learned to listen. Fittingly they chatted as communities nationwide reached out to each other for the third year of the Great Get Together in memory of murdered MP Jo Cox. The Mirror partnered with theand regional newspapers across Reach PLC to find the widest possible audience. More than , readers were brave enough to sign up, and hundreds finally met their political opposite yesterday in Huddersfield and Hull, Devon and Bristol, Edinburgh and Brecon. Three years after the EU referendum result, the aim was to escape our own social bubbles, and to share a cup of tea or have a pint in the sunshine with someone of opposing opinions.    Our matches joined tens of thousands who attended events remembering Jo, who was killed a right-wing extemist, and honouring her belief that we have “more in common than that which ides us”. Arch Brexiteer Claire Milne, , had a robust exchanges in Edinburgh with ardent Remainer company director John Birchmore. It left them keen to chat again. Afterwards Claire laughed: “No milkshakes were thrown.” Our couples aired their strong views about Brexit , immigration, climate change, Donald Trump, austerity and crime. They came together over the NHS, their local football team, public transport and most of all the need to talk to each other. Described as “political Tinder”, Britain Talks is based on My Country Talks – an initiative from German news website Zeit Online. The original experiment has been repeated in Italy, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland and Austria, as Europe confronts its isions.

The same poll showed % felt our country was ided – with % arguing with family or friends about Brexit several times a week.

The words “we’ve got more in common” wrapped in large letters around the faces of Hendrik de Jong, , and Humaira Ali, . Ex-police officer Hendrik supports the Brexit Party and wants Britain to leave the EU immediately. Humaira is a Lib Dem councillor for Southwark. They met at the Great British Get Together happening on London’s Bankside – a festival inspired by the work of murdered MP Jo Cox. Humaira says: “I think there’s a lot we agree onyou take out Brexit – health, housing, social responsibility and the environment. Hendrik adds: “We both believe in equality.” The pair even agreed to meet up again. Hendrik says: “After Holland joined the EU my family lost money on their pensions. We were % worse off afterwards and had no vote on it. British politicians now need to get a better deal for Britain.” But Humaira says: “We already have the best deal. Margaret Thatcher negotiated it years ago. We’re not in Schengen and we don’t have the euro.” Huddersfield  When Phil Wood meets Adam Rana in a cafe, the Remainer is worried that Adam’s entrepreneurial side will make his views hard to swallow. But after meeting, community development consultant Phil, , realises that despite their political dferences his concerns are misplaced. Self-confessed “hopeless idealist” Phil says: “I think we want the same thing really – a better world where people take more care of each other, take more responsibility and are prepared to go out of their way rather than just think about themselves.” Adam, , who trades over the internet, says: “I’m a firm believer in leaving the EU because it will help Britain’s trading position.” Adam, a full-time carer for his we, believes a thriving economy will create better public services.But Phil warns it could lead to “dog eat dog”. Adam says of the meeting: “It has opened my views up to someone ’s way of thinking. I feel the focus is on ‘me, me ,me’.” And he laments the way the Government shuns the elderly, forcing them to rely on charity. “It seems a case of ‘Thanks for the service, we don’t want to know about you’.” Manchester  One is a die-hard Brexiteer, the other a dedicated Remainer. “I’m sick of being called a Remoaner when all I want is a better future for my kids,” says catering assistant Donna Chadwick, , a mum of two teenage boys from Heywood. Terence Farrand, , a semi-retired builder, has lived in Europe but is clear we should be out of the EU, with no second vote. “If we do that, democracy is finished,” he warns. For Terence, married with four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, immigration means pressure on the NHS. “You can’t get an appointment when you need one,” he says. Donna says: “Yes, services are struggling but that’s more about investment.” But when Donna and Terence, from Whitefield, meet over wine and coffee, they find a shared love of Bury Football Club – and agree the NHS needs cash. “It’s been good to have someone to listen to what I’ve got to say, without being shouted down,” says Donna, as they decide to meet up again this week. Terence agrees. “I have strong opinions but we live in a world where people are scared to express them, or to speak to someone with dferent views.” Brecon Beacons  In the foothills of the Brecon Beacons, Annette Lloyd and Emily Durrant are searching for common ground in a canal-side cafe. Emily was not even born when Annette started her first job in a factory, and they are never going to agree on Brexit. But there is much to unite them... Emily, , juggles two young children and three jobs, including her role as a Green Party county councillor. Meanwhile, Annette, , toils on nights as a support worker and helps to look after her grandchildren and elderly relatives. Both agree low wages and austerity mean families are under pressure. Emily, who also works for the National Trust, says: “The economy doesn’t work for families. Wages are just too low.” Emily, from Llangorse, Powys, is a committed Remainer. Annette, , favours Brexit. “It’ll get the factories working again,” she says. But Emily finds common ground with Annette, from Llandeilo Graban, over the NHS. “We’ve been sold down the river,” they agree. Before going their separate ways, Annette and Emily hug and laugh. “When you look at the bigger picture,” Annette says, “we’re very similar.” Stoke  In the leafy hamlet of Stockton Brook, near Stoke- on-Trent, it’s clear William Alcock and Louise Adams both feel passionately about their city. William, , served in the Army for  years before joining the police and Louise, , is a freelance artist who works in the ceramics industry. And William, now retired, doesn’t hesitate to air his views about Brexit. He says: “We are spending £million a day to be in the EU. That is what we are paying the thieves in Brussels. They have taken away our sovereignty. “We are losing control of this country and we are losing control of our cultures.” Louise believes we should stay in the EU. “It will allow us to build on love, peace and friendships,” she says. “Being part of the EU has allowed us to work together, share cultures and ideas.” Louise believes that with the right investment refugees can settle here successfully but William is concerned about the pressure it puts on the NHS. But they agree they both want what’s best for their beloved country.

The presenter and journalist, , was seen travelling with her whippet, Moody, on a busy Great Western train to London Paddington this afternoon. There were few empty seats but she let her dog curl up next to her. Other paying passengers had to look ­where for a place to sit. A witness said: “I was really surprised to see the dog on the seat. There wasn’t even a mat or newspaper underneath it. “For someone who is very much in the public eye, who holds politicians to account, I would have expected her to behave better. “When I boarded the train it was really busy. A lady was looking for a seat and ended up sitting behind Emily and not on a seat with a table, where there is more room.  “Some people chose to stand, as there were few spare seats. It shows a lack of respect for other passengers to feel it appropriate for dogs to sit on seats meant for passengers. “It’s a question of courtesy and consideration for others. The dog should have been on the floor. It could have been dirty or could have had ticks or fleas.” The witness, going from Reading, Berks to London, said Maitlis’s dog slept on the Penzance to London service for at least  minutes before Paddington. Last week, Maitlis, one of ­Britain’s most respected interviewers, was criticised over her handling of the televised Tory leadership debate with hundreds of BBC viewers accusing her of losing control of the candidates and failing to get answers. Bruce Williamson, of the ­Railfuture campaign, said expensive train fares mean “people who have paid for a ticket must come first”.  He added: “I’m surprised a conductor didn’t say something about it. I’m a dog lover, but dogs on trains are essentially luggage and second-class ­citizens to humans. Seats should be reserved for first and ­foremost for humans. “It just highlights the level of overcrowding on our railways and the shortage of seats.” A railway passenger group said Maitlis broke one of the network operators rules. Fraser Pithie, of the Campaign for Rail, said: “The rules do not give animals any right to take up seats. Dogs must remain on the floor. Even guide dogs are not allowed on seats. A train guard should have spoken to her.”  A spokesman from Great Western confirmed the company does allow people to bring animals on their trains but said they are never allowed on seats. National Rail conditions say: “Animals are not allowed on seats in any circumstances” and warn a charge could be madeanimals occupy seats. In a statement, Maitlis said: “There was no one without a seat looking to sit down. “The dog was under the table for the first three hours of the journey whilst four people sat down at it. He came on to the seat for the last  minutes of the journey when the seat next to me became free.” "},{"url":null,"title":"three years after eu referendum","story":"NewsThree years after the EU referendum Britain is more ided than ever on BrexitAs Westminster fails to find solutions, more people favour “no deal” or a second referendumShareByRyan Fletcher:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsStuart Lilland Nick Thompson both from Hull, discuss Brexit \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Three years after the EU referendum, Britain is more ided than ever on Brexit .As Westminster fails to find solutions, more people favour “no deal” or a second referendum. But left-right politics, Scottish independence, trans rights and veganism are also among the topics which we are ided over. Hull voted by .% to .% to leave the EU. Locals Nick Thompson and Stuart Lill dfer over Brexit, but agree politicians are failing to bridge the ide. Marketing worker Nick, , is a Remainer, while Stuart, , a carer for his autistic son, is a Leaver. Stuart says: “It’s very much a case of, ‘You must be a racistyou voted Brexit’. Tell that to my Polish better half and Polish kids. “I’m still a Brexiteer, I just care about my country.” Nick says: “It’s wrong that people on the Leave side are labelled like that. Part of the trouble is representation. You don’t feel represented and I don’t feel represented either.  “It’s just I don’t think that situation will change by leaving the EU.” Stuart and Nick both feel public services are being starved of resources but dfer on the causes. Nick says: “Austerity was a choice by the UK Government and nothing to do with Europe. “Some say it had to be made, but it didn’t. When you think they can’t cut any more, they cut more and more.“As one of the richest countries in the world, we shouldn’t have foodbanksall over the place.We shouldn’t have all these people sleeping on the streets.” Stuart thinks immigration has added to the pressures on public services. He says: “You can’t argue that the numbers that have come haven’t added to the burden on things such as housing and hospital waiting lists. “Populism is rising across Europe because of the hatred of the EU.” Nick worries the power will go from the EU to the UK Government which is “a lot less trustworthy than Brussels”. Stuart agrees: “I don’t think there’s a political party out there that is really doing a very good job.” Nick says: “We both feel politically homeless. Politics now is a shambles.” Devon  * A clash over climate change got a cool reaction from Green Party voter Adrian Allery when UKIP supporter Andre Savini said blaming CO for global warming was hot air. Proving it is possible to disagree very agreeably, -year-old antiques shop manager Andre and deep-sea ship pilot Adrian, , shared their views over a pint in Honiton, Devon. Leave voter Andre argued: “It’s a myth that CO is the main driver in climate change.” Remain voter Adrian thought the two-hour pub chat raised interesting points. “But I simply do not agree with Andre that climate change is a scam to raise taxes, that big pharma is toxic or that the EU is an evil Stalinist empire,” he said. But even these unlikely lads found common ground. They agreed faith schools should be abolished and the first-past-the-post political system is not fit for purpose. Despite his Italian roots, Andre believes immigration has to be controlled, saying he supports UKIP because “mainstream parties are just there for big business”. While Adrian said, “I felt Andre cherry picks facts that back his theories. I was glad we met, I’d do it again.” Bristol  When two Bristol locals went on a debating date in the park, they found plenty of common ground. The sun smiled on -year-old electrician James Pierce and NHS administrator Jane Westmead, , and they found their dferences melting away.Poetry lover Jane said: “It went really, really well. James was very honest, and we were still chatting away hours later when we bumped into Bristol’s Labour mayor Marvin Rees in the park and he joined in the discussions.”Leave voter James said he was expecting Jane to be shouty and unwilling to listen, but instead she was fun and open-minded. He explained: “Although we disagree on many issues, we have the same goals. Jane voted for Remain, but she respects the result and neither of us want a second referendum.” Left-voting Jane admits she had preconceived notions about staunch Tory James. But she said: “We both love the NHS but think it’s very inefficient. London  Retired local government officer Ken Hickford and charity worker Billy Beckett met in a North London Italian restaurant for their debate. Ken, , wants Britain out of Europe but Billy, , thinks unity makes us stronger and more secure. Ken reckons refugees should get sanctuary but be sent home when their nation is back on its feet as the UK’s infrastructure is close to collapse. Billy thinks, by then, they may bring all sorts of value to us and austerity may be more to blame for the problems. They are polar opposites but Ken said: “I liked Billy’s enthusiasm. He seems to believe in politicians and our conversation did give me a boost.” Billy liked talking to someone with dferent views. He said: “Social media confirms our own biases. This has been a way to step out of it.” Liverpool  Remainer Michelle Bennett and committed Brexiteer Dave Jones live just a few miles away from each other. But, on paper, they are poles apart. It isn’t long before Michelle, , a trained social worker, and retired community nurse Dave, , are setting the world to rights over a coffee. Mum-of-one Michelle voted to Leave but has since become a Remainer – worried about the prospect of no deal – and wants a second referendum. “So much has changed since then,” she says. Dave, a mild-mannered father of four from Wavertree, disagrees. He said: “We need to respect the result.” But, both are clear the NHS needs to be valued and we should help refugees. Michelle lives in Toxteth – where Dave was born – and they leave, laughing, and admitting they’d loved the experience. Dave even offered Michelle a lt home. Edinburgh  They met as strangers on a bridge coming from opposite sides. John Birchmore, , is a company director and such an ardent Remainer he moved his company’s centre of operations to Latvia and has a new Irish passport. John’s campaigning for a People’s Vote and even has politics discussions with his postie, who decried the EU as non-democratic while delivering his postal vote. “He failed to see the irony,” says John. Claire Milne, , is a Jacob Rees-Mogg-loving, Tory-voting Brexiteer. At home, she has been told she’s only allowed to speak three sentences of politics a day because, “I tend to go on a bit”. As they settle down to a cool drink in the shade of Edinburgh’s Princes Street Gardens, their conversation heats up until there is table thumping and exclamations of “cobblers!” and “b*****ks!”. John says: “There were lots of myths pedalled by Brexiteers about not being able to sell crooked cucumbers.” Claire retorts: “Bananas!” It’s a robust  minutes. At times, their voices rise higher than a nearby pipes and drums contest. But, at the end, both are keen to chat again. “It’s great to listen to someone who is well informed and can be challenged on details,” John says.

I was in Tampa with friends when I heard folk music coming from an Irish and Scottish bar, The Harp  Thistle. I liked the music, so I went in. There one night, I met this beautul, lively woman named Linda. We started dating and I soon learned she was heavily involved with Noraid, the US political wing of the Provisional IRA. I didn’t know much about the Northern Ireland conflict, but feigned interest because I liked Linda. She invited me to Ireland and I accepted. We drove up to Sligo and Donegal on the west coast – Linda knew the owners of pro-IRA bars and they all knew her by her first name.    One of the owners, Joe O’Neill, was a long-time IRA man and he took a liking to me and taught me about Irish history. Linda and I broke up soon afterwards, but I was hooked on Ireland by then and went back by myself to meet Joe and other IRA men.I didn’t know it at the time, but the Irish police were photographing me with IRA members and sent the photos to the FBI.One day an FBI agent showed up at my trucking company office. I said I didn’t know about anything illegal, which was the truth, but he insisted on coming back to ask questions. He then said the FBI would pay for me and my new girlfriend, Maureen, to fly to Ireland when we wanted, in exchange for small pieces of information about the IRA.    As I didn’t know anything, I felt I might as well let the FBI pay for our holidays. So we would go back and forth to Ireland and give the FBI very little. Then one day, Joe invited me to the room he used for IRA meetings, which was above his pub. He said he wanted me to smuggle explosive parts from the US, and gave me the address of a primary school where I should send them – the plastic explosives were to be hidden in teddy bears, detonating cord disguised as skipping rope, and electronic parts hidden in radios. This made me flinch – the idea of sending explosives to a school. I said I would, but I passed on the info to the FBI, and soon the spying operation became more serious. I wanted to move to Ireland anyway, and the FBI agreed to pay for the lease on a pub on the Irish border, near Joe’s bar. My bar quickly became a gathering point for IRA members and the information started to come in.  I liked the customers, but some moments shocked me – like watching a granny bouncing a young boy on her knee and telling him some day he would shoot policemen in the North. Pretty soon the FBI asked me to meet MI, which was keen to have spies in the IRA groups that were opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process. I flew to London for a debrief with an MI agent, and soon I was reporting to them as well. Then, in August , the Real IRA set off a car bomb in Omagh, which killed  civilians, including a mother nine months pregnant with twins. Later, Maureen and I watched a documentary about children injured in the Omagh bomb, one of whom was blinded. It was devastating.  I had to remind myself these were the people I was dealing with. There was a tendency to see them as friends, but I also had to find those other feelings at the back of that – revulsion and disgust for what was happening to innocent people. Then I was introduced to the Real IRA’s leader, Mickey McKevitt, along with several of his top men. He liked me straight away, and I liked him. He was easy to talk to and was enthusiastic about American fund-raising money and my ability to get weapons and bomb parts in the US.Over time, I learned he had a sleeper agentin the US who would be brought to the UK when the time was right to shoot Tony Blair , or some other high-level British establishment figure.I met the sleeper several times in Massachusetts and he was keen toget weapons moving to Ireland.Eventually, Mickey suggested I sit on the Real IRA’s army council. I wouldn’t have voting rights, but I could very to US supporters that their money was being well spent and be able to report back on weapons and bomb parts needed by the Real IRA.The army council meetings were held at a farmer’s cottage in the mountains on the border, where the farmer’s we would make us tea, while he discussed bombings in England and assassinations of police officers.I would send detailed emails to the FBI and MI of what was happening.My scariest moment came when I attended the ‘engineering’ orbomb-making meetings.I brought along encryption software for the team that had been doctored by MI.  One of the top bomb makers was very suspicious and said that it might have been tampered with. My heart was racing and I was sweating. I was petried and couldn’t sleep that night. I was really on edge, wonderingthe Real IRA would find out that the encryption software had been compromised. What would happen to me and Maureenthey did  I knew about the torture and death that came to other IRA informers. There was a case in which a woman was beaten to death by three IRA members, while with another informer, they set up a roadblock, shot him in the back of the head and rolled his car into the canal. The police didn’t find his body for two years. That would have been my fate.  I began to wonder how much longer we could stay in this le. Mickey told me he was looking for a foreign sponsor to supply them with weapons and was interested in Saddam Hussein.I told MI, who were excited and saw it as an opportunity to ensnare the Real IRA.It was agreed with MI that I would testy against some of the Real IRA leadership, and in one day there were arrests of leaders in the south of Ireland, the north, and the US. I was flown to a US airbase in Britain, as I was due to testy against three Real IRA council members who had set up meetings with Saddam Hussein’s agents . Then I flew on the British royal jet to testy against Mickey McKevitt, who was arrested at his home. He wasn’t one bit happy to see me this time, and glared at me. I was nervous at the beginning of the trial – there were lots of TV cameras outside the court, and army snipers on the roof of the courtroom. Mickey’s barrister cross-examined me for two weeks. It was gruelling.  After I finally finished testying, the SAS took me by Hercules plane out of Ireland forever. The most stressful part was after I had finished testying and ed to the US in hiding. I had all this adrenaline running through me for years. Suddenly I wasn’t living on the edge any more and couldn’t handle my emotions. I went on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs, Maureen went on them too. We couldn’t adjust to this new passive world after so many years undercover, but I eventually learned to get on with le and enjoy myself. Mickey McKevitt was jailed for  years and I know he will never forgive me. Still, after the Omagh bomb, I have no regrets about what I did.  I also earned millions of dollars from the FBI, but I can never work again because the Real IRA would catch up with me.

I couldnapost relate. The University of Kent in Canterbury was my number one choice. While attending an applicant day, I was immediately put at ease. The campus was beautul, my desired course— religious studies — was being taught by world class scholars, and it was not too far from my home in Bromley. I instantly knew it was  meant to be.    It is, however, an understatement to say that in September   I was nervous. I dreamt and imagined what this new phase of my le would entail but had no idea what to expect.The numerous Netflix films I watched, exhibiting the American college experience would never prepare me for the journey I was about to embark on.“We hate you you f******  n*****” was the racial abuse directed at me by my housemate in my halls of residence.  My housemates took personal offence to the fact that I did not want to drink and go out with them. I was friendly but reserved because I was still acclimatising to le away from home. Additionally, getting drunk every night and being asked to clean up vomit was not my idea of fun.  It was only the first couple of months of university, I wanted to take my time. I had worked so hard to get into university. It goes without saying that I quickly became the least favourite person in the house. Living in the most aesthetically pleasing accommodation, Turing College,  on campus — jokingly referred to by some as Beverly Hills — could not compensate for living with people I did not get on with. My bedroom not only became the place where I had to store my kitchenware, it became my sanctuary. However, even my room couldnapost shield me from the unedying sight of  strangers using my shared toilet with the door wide open! It is a notorious attitude that because the first year does not contribute to your final degree, you do not have to work as hard. Whilst many of  my first year counterparts were partying nightly, I was determined to excel academically from the outset.      Consequently, I was a first year student stressing out like a final year one. Year  Carrying the weight of isolation that the  first year brought, I feared that my bedroom, my place of refuge, had become a cage, locking me away from all of the enjoyable experiences that the University of Kent had to offer. I did not regret working hard in my first year because that is what I set out to do.  I did, however, feel that consuming myself solely with my degree was unhealthy and not conducive to forming meaningful relationships and enjoying my university experience outside of academia.    As a British-Jamaican person, I noticed that a wider isolation  existed among students of caribbean heritage at university. In response to this,  I co-founded a society, with Louise Mayne, where  such students could be represented and elevated. This society, Kent Caribbean Union , aims to rewrite the narrative by educating, raising aspirations and inspiring all students to fulfill their potential. It was, therefore, to my dismay that KCU had to fight for the right to exist. Even the backdrop of the th anniversary year of Windrush and the infamous Windrush scandal would not motivate some members of the student body  to acknowledge our right to be represented. Second year was the year where I really had to strengthen my time management skills. In addition to my responsibilities to the society, I  devoted time to being an academic mentor and outreach ambassador. By this stage I no longer lived on campus, but privately rented of off campus   with my sister and two other friends  — whom I had met during the previous year. The courses we studied were religious studies, maths and law. The novelty of not living under your parent’s roof soon wears off as you become burdened with the responsibilities that come with independent living. Luckily, I moved to Canterbury from Bromley and so was never too far away toto home comforts. Year  With Canterbury Cathedral within a stoneaposs throw of my house, I was ashamed that by my final year I still I had not managed to visit it. I began to explore the beauty of the city. Walking down the quaint cobbled streets served as a constant reminder of the rich heritage of this city. The contrast between the lively and progressive student city with the historic sights and buildings never ceases to fascinate me. This amazement, however, quickly dwindled when I noticed the visible homelessness, something I did not see as often in Bromley. Canterbury is home to three dferent universities, accommodating thousands of UK and international students. It is evident that much of the  ersity present in the city can largely be attributed to the substantial student population.    I always wonder what Canterbury would look like without such student residents  This year was the most rewarding as the society soared to new heights. At the Kent Student Awards , KCU, was awarded ‘Group of the Year’ and ‘Outstanding International Multicultural Initiative of the Year.’ We were also shortlisted for Outstanding Contribution to Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity, being the only group to be shortlisted in more than one category. The awards ceremony celebrated other inspiring students who are contributing to changes in government policy, campaigning against social injustices and raising awareness of illnesses. Considering this, not only is there evidently hope for my generation, but I am proud to have unapologetically fought for something I believe in. Whilst my three years in Canterbury have been physically, mentally and emotionally draining, they have built my character,confidence and inner strength. So would I do it again  No. Am I happy that I did it  % yes. I have left Canterbury, not just with a st class degree, but with a better sense of self. University of Kent statement A spokesman for the university said: We do not tolerate any form of racism or racist abuse. We are committed to the promotion of ersity and inclusivity within the University community, and this commitment is underpinned in our Institutional Strategic Plan. Through the Student Charter that we developed with Kent Union, the University has also committed to the fair and equal treatment of every person, and to ersity and inclusivity in its student and staff community.    Our students are also committed to treating fellow students, University staff, visitors, neighbours and all people equally and respectfully, regardless of gender, religion, community background, nationality, race ethnic origin, disability, marital or other status, responsibilities, sexual orientation or age.   In order to ensure all students are fully informed when it comes to treating everyone with dignity and respect we created the aposExpect Respect @ Kent’ e-learning module which all students must complete within six months of arriving at Kent.

Sophie Matheson, , dropped from a size  to a size  in just  weeks after getting in touch with a personal trainer. She got married in October and has since lost another stone, taking her total weight loss to six stone. Sophie, who works at Intake Farm Primary School in Mansfield, said: I had reached a point where I was dreading my wedding day. I was anxious about the photos, how I would look and feel in my dress and what others would think of me, and knew I had to do something to make a positive change.    She got in touch with local personal trainer Luke Hewitt after seeing some of his work on social media. Sophie, who lives in Ollerton, in Nottinghamshire, said she was nervous before her first session but was put at ease by Lukeaposs team. I started to see changes really quickly and began to develop a love for the gym, she told Nottinghamshire Live . She trained with Luke three times a week for  weeks in the lead up to her wedding day, with a programme that included a combination of cardiovascular exercise and weight training as well as a diet plan. Sophie said: My job as a primary school teacher can be quite stressful and fast paced and my diet before starting the programme reflected that. A typical day would have previously started with good intentions, with Weetabix for breakfast and fruit for my mid-morning snack, but then it would start to go downhill. Lunchtime would arrive and the staff room at work would be full of cakes and biscuits, so I’d help myself to those before grabbing a pre-packed wrap or sandwich for lunch. After work, I’d go to the shop and get crisps, sweets and chocolates and binge eat and then dinner would be something like wedges and a burger. We would also indulge in takeaways several times a week.”  Before she lost the weight, Sophie took  tablets a day for endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome , but now she doesnapost take any medication at all. Sophie is a vegetarian and now keeps to a diet plan tailored for her. A typical day would consist of porridge or an omelette for breakfast, Quorn chilli, rice and salad for lunch and halloumi and vegetables kebabs with curried lentils for dinner, as well as ious snacks to keep her going throughout the day. She said: At first I couldnapost believe how much food I was able to eat. Iaposve tried every fad diet going so feeling satisfied rather than deprived made a huge dference to my motivation and sticking power. That, combined with my gym sessions, has completely changed my le for the better. I used to make excuses not to go out to social events and didnapost feel comfortable in anything I tried on. Now, I’m happier in all aspects of le: I’m more confident at work, have an even better relationship with my husband and I’m happier on holiday because I can wear what I want without feeling uncomfortable.”  By her wedding day, Sophie had got her weight down to  stone and wore a size  wedding dress. She has continued training and lost a further stone. She said: I felt amazing on my wedding day, and I definitely have Luke to thank for that, but for me this wasn’t just about losing weight for my wedding. It was about becoming happier and healthier for good and I know I’ll never go back to my old habits because I feel so much better and coming off my medication speaks volumes.  “The gym has become my therapy and no matter what mood I arrive in, I always leave feeling on top of the world.

Chance Lewis-Donnelly and Stewart Brown, who were sat about eight rows behind the woman, said she became abusive swearing and then trying to hit the staff. She complained about their seats when they first got on the plane... but she seemed fine then and fairly polite as a couple swapped seats with her, Miss Lewis-Donnelly, of Deal, Kent, said.

Were you aboard the plane  Contact webnews@trinitymirror  About  to  minutes later she started kicking off, hitting the seat in front of her and shouting. She then stopped and we took off. As we took off she started shouting and singing again. The cabin crew asked her to stop, but she continued. And eventually staff had to request assistance from the RAF, which sent two fighter jets to escort the Titan Airways A back to Stansted, in Essex. People reported hearing an explosion as the jets were scrambled - later confirmed by police as a sonic boom - up to  miles away.    The passenger was restrained until she was escorted off the flight by officers from Essex Police. She remains in custody after being arrested on suspicion of two assaults and endangering an aircraft. Dramatic photos and video seen bycapture the arrest. But Miss Lewis-Donnelly continued: She became abusive, swearing and then trying to hit the staff. She walked down the aisle and was attempting to open the cockpit door. She was restrained by cabin crew and passengers.  The crew decided we needed to ert and contacted air traffic control who thought we needed assistance so scrambled the military jets, and all the while she was being restrained by passengers. She was escorted off the plane by police when we landed but the police had her on the runway for a while causing further disruptions. We were around eight rows back, but most of the commotion happened at the front of the plane so I couldn’t hear what was being said, only her shouting. Jet sent a plane from Manchester to collect the other passengers and take them to Turkey - and they arrived some six hours later than scheduled.  Mr Brown, a -year-old mobile DJ, said: She seemed absolutely fine before take off. The stewards gave her several chances and did the best they could before she became abusive and then made a dash for the cockpit and had to be restrained by staff and passengers. A spokesman for the airline said: “We are aware of an incident regarding an extremely disruptive passenger on a flight from Stansted to Dalaman yesterday. The aircraft has ed safely and we are liaising with the relevant authorities to support their investigation. We are working hard to ensure the remaining customers reach their destination as soon possible.  The assisting jets were scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Essex Police reassured residents the huge bang was not an explosion, as initially feared. We were made aware of a disruptive passenger on an inbound flight to Stansted on Saturday, June , a spokesman for the force said. There is a possibility that residents nearby may have heard a loud noise, often associated with a sonic boom, as the aircraft descended into Stansted airspace. Officers attended and arrested a -year-old woman on suspicion of two assaults and endangering an aircraft.

After learning at school how rubbish is endangering sea le, the eco-aware pair from Southampton set up an online petition for fast-food giants to stop putting plastic toys in children’s meal boxes. Inspired to act after a family trip to Burger King, their campaign has already attracted , signatures – and counting.  The girls said: “We like to go to eat at Burger King and McDonald’s but ­children only play with the plastic toys they give us for a few minutes before they get thrown away and harm animals and pollute the sea.” Staggeringly, McDonald’s is the largest toy distributor in the world, handing out more than . billion a year in a tsunami of single-use plastic. On tomorrow night’s War on Plastic on BBC One – hosted by Anita Rani – the problem is laid bare showing millions of toys – many unopened from fast-food meals and magazines, as well as Kinder Surprise eggs, all adding to our mountain of plastic waste. A new advert has also popped up on our TV screens to promote Cadbury Freddo Treasures. But this “treat” is more plastic waste than chocolate – a purple plastic treasure chest and plastic toy versus a handful of chocolate buttons.    Yes, in theory these toys can be recycled – as McDonald’s states on its website – but it is rarely economically viable to do so thanks to the mixture of plastics they are made from, meaning most still end up in landfill or being incinerated. And the thing is, the kids don’t actually want them either. “We want anything they give to us to be sustainable so we can protect the planet for us and future ­generations,” Ella and Caitlin added. The solution to this problem lies with the producers taking ­more responsibility for this mess. Help the girls out by signing their petition here .

Imagination is necessary in spades however, because for this particular property, viewing is not essential, or even advised. In fact, potential buyers are warned ‘DO NOT enter the cottage UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES’. And since Lavender Cottage went up for sale in , firstly for £,, and then inviting offers in the region of £,, no-one has been allowed inside... until now.  Inside the abandoned Aleister Crowley house of West Cornwall  After following the old path on my hands and knees through the undergrowth for about  feet, I reach Lavender Cottage, completely hidden in a Cornish jungle of brambles and stinging nettles. Despite all the branches pushing into the building from every side like nature’s scaffolding, the structure looks decidedly unsafe, as warned. Nevertheless, I don my hard hat and delicately climb through the window.     The cottage is small and simple, with the ground floor split in half by a staircase iding what was once a lounge and a kitchen, leading upstairs to where there was once two bedrooms. The cottage features on historic maps dating back to .  The empty bottles of Corona also date back to the eighties, when people could redeem p when they ed the bottles to be recycled.In , UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove proposed that similar schemes were reintroduced to encourage people to recycle bottles by financial incentives.The  pence redeemable for the two Corona bottles is included in the price of the property.    Since this half drunken can of Coke was left on a rusting fridge, at least three decades have passed. The Berlin Wall has fallen, as have almost all of the interior walls in Lavender Cottage.  However, the cottage has not been untouched during that time. There are signs inside where repairs have started in earnest. Cob has been used to try and sure up some of the walls, as has concrete in places, such as around the old Rayburn.    In , a planning application for ‘alterations and erection of extension sites’ were ‘approved with conditions’. With the house derelict at this time, there are no obvious signs that these plans came to fruition.      Transforming the cottage from a two bedroomed house with no toilet into a three bedroomed home with bathroom and downstairs W.C., the plans appear to have been approved by Carrick District Council, but again, never became a reality.   The first Google Street View car to drive past Lavender Cottage, did so in June .A ‘WARNING KEEP OUT’ sign can be seen on the side of the house, which is still there today somewhere underneath the foliage. However, there appears to be repair work on the roof and front of the building, and a caravan on the land has its door open, asoccupied.    Lavender Cottage went on the market for £, with Camel Homes in , described as offering the ‘opportunity to live the dream in Cornwall and create your own perfect home’.    Despite the cottage being off limits to any prospective buyers, the estate agents say that they have had a lot of interest in the derelict property which sits on a plot of approximately . of an acre. However, no-one has snapped it up yet, and not being able to see inside it might not be the only factor putting people off.    The letter from Cornwall Council to the interested buyer concluded: “In summary the proposal that you have put forward for residential development through replacement for which Policy  of the Cornwall Local Plan is unlikely to be supported as the residential use on the site appears to have been abandoned. If you are minded to proceed with the development proposal on this site it is strongly recommended that you first obtain a Lawful Development Certicate to demonstrate that the existing home is in fact lawful.” What this essentially boils down to, is that planning permission to demolish Lavender Cottage and build a new home in its place is considered likely to be refused. So anyone who buys this property will have to work with what is already there, renovating the existing property as it stands.    Asthis old cottage wasn’t entangled enough with greenery, it is also now constrained by red tape. However, it doesn’t take too much of a stretch of the imagination to pull back the brambles and ivy and see this home as it once was, with its sunny garden and plentul orchard.    And standing inside Lavender Cottage, red tape to one side, it is easy to see how these crumbling walls could become a home once again.If you would like to find out more about Lavender Cottage, you can get details from  Camel Homes . Do not enter the property under any circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"judge rinder saved life man","story":"NewsJudge Rinder saved my le: Man loses  STONE after seeing himself on TVMitchell Yafai says he looked \"disgusting\" after years of gorging on crisps, sweets and three litres of fizzy drinks a dayShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv tv-news video judge-rinder-tries-understand-tracy-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A Judge Rinder guest has lost an incredible st after his appearance on the reality TV show left him horried and determined to change his lestyle.Mitchell Yafai weighed st after years of gorging on crisps and sweets, and downing three litres of fizzy drinks a day - and he now credits Judge Rinder for saving his le.

Weight loss surgery can carry a small risk of complications such as excess folds of skin that may need to be removed with further surgery, a lack of vitamins and minerals from the new diet, gallstones, a blood clot in the leg, the gastric band slipping out of place or food leaking from the join between the stomach and small intestine.

She was £ overdrawn and owed her friend £. The earnings from her part-time job as a waitress weren’t going to pay the debts she owed.Then, an advert popped up on her Facebook feed featuring a ‘sugar daddy dating’ website.“They target students and you actually get a free premium accountyou have a student email,” says Jess.  “When you look at the page there’s an image of a young attractive man. “They make you think that these men are mentors and, that they are going to help you with your career, men who don’t view you in a sexual way. “When really, sex is usually the end goal, she said. Jess said it soon became apparent that ‘sugar daddy dating’ wasn’t a scenario where an older, wealthy man lavishes a younger girl with gts or long-term financial support. Instead, men were using it as a way to pay students for sex. At first she would meet men for dates only, making between £ to £ per meet. But as her financial circumstances became more desperate, she agreed to have sex with the men she met online for much larger sums of cash. On the first arrangement of this kind, Jess was picked up from her student house in Fallowfield by a man driving a Lamborghini. “My first proper, proper sugar daddy messaged saying ‘a dinner and a date and a night at mine for a grand’,” says Jess. “I’d never been on a date like that but I was desperate so I had to take the risk. “I got in his Lambo and he passed me a grand in cash, a wad of £ notes with a ring around it. I’d never seen that amount of money before. “That was one of the few glamorous occasions of sugar daddy dating for me. “I was so scared I askedI could get out the car and post the money through the door in case he killed me. “I felt I had so little choice at the time I just did it.” Jess estimates she met with around  men through a website over four years. The men she’d meet were usually in their forties and fties with a iety of jobs and backgrounds. Some were wealthy businessmen or doctors, but some she knew very little about. “They don’t all have loads of money,” adds Jess. “In fact, some are really tight.” What sugar daddies seek from sugar babies ies, Jess says. Some want to take the girls on dates and have the ‘girlfriend experience’, while some ask for arrangements where there are no sexual limitations and want to indulge fetishes. Jess said she often hid the seedy reality of sugar daddy dating from her friends. “Some of my friends thought it was really fun and glamorous but that was only because I didnapost tell anyone what it was really like, most women don’t,” she added. “Most of us wouldn’t admit what it’s really like unless it’s to another sugar baby.  “I sugarcoated it at the time because I didn’t want anyone to know what I was really doing. “I did feel a lot of shame because of the way men and women view sex work. But you can’t deny that it’s happening and it’s not going to stop.” Jess said the longer she did sugar daddy dating, the more risks she took. It all started to have a severe effect on her mental health. She said she was left traumatised by some of her experiences with men who paid her, and has had therapy to recover. “Once you get into it you get used to the money and it’s hard to get out,” says Jess. “You start lowering your standards and you start taking risks because you need the money. “And when you get the money you spend because you think ‘this is an easy le’. “I was making up to £ a date sometimes, but not all the time. “It was enough to support myself but also my problems. “My mental health severely deteriorated around this time and it was heavily influenced by what I was doing. “I felt so isolated and there was no support for people like me at the time. “There’s nothing for the girls to chat on the site I used. “I’d reported a number of users to the site and never got a response. “None of it is taken seriously. “I’m not saying that all the men on there are not nice. “But in my experience the vast majority of men don’t treat you like you’re human. A sugar daddy once said to me, aposI usually go for girls who are less pretty like you because they are less confidentapos. “To them you’re an investment and a sexual investment.” Jess managed to extract herself from sugar daddy dating last year. With therapy and the support of her partner, Jess has taken control of her mental health and is recovering from some of her experiences.    Her aim is to get a job as a mental health support worker and start her masters in applied theatre in the autumn. Her sugar babies support group will be open to students turning to sex work through websites to fund their time at university. “I managed to get out of sugar daddy dating and I want to be part of that process for other people. “I want people to know that I’m not judging those with a positive experience. “I personally had a terrible experience and at the time I felt there wasn’t any support available to me “I want to provide that support for men and women without judgment.” The Manchester Evening News has contacted the website Jess used for a response.

His parents ensured he had staff tending to his every need, and the gardens of his home were filled with cages containing monkeys and bears for his entertainment. Huge playrooms boasted more toys than any European store and the gardens inside the walled compounds where he was raised were so large that many called them parks. A personal chef was hired to be the future North Korean dictatoraposs friend - and the young Kim would don military gear to boss adults around. Thataposs according to a new book about the feared world leader, who executed his uncle and had his half-brother killed with a nerve agent.  Washington Post journalist Anna Field has chronicled his le as a child and as a teenager sent to study in Switzerland in new book The Great Successor. The son of former Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il - who died in  - and grandson of the countryaposs founder, Kim Il-sung, he was a spoiled brat in childhood. Contact with other children was scarce, Field writes, with his eighth birthday party attended by high-ranking adults instead of other children. In an interview with Vox, Field said: He was brought up to believe that he was a demigod from the age of three or four, probably as long as he can remember.  Even when North Koreans were plunged into famine, Kim was probably unaware of the horric conditions they were enduring, she believes. Determined to give the young boy the same mythical status afforded to his father and grandfather, propagandists claimed Kim was such a good marksman that he could hit a lightbulb from  metres. When he was eight, it was claimed he could drive a truck at mph. The author said he was close to his mother, Ko Yong Hui, from who he got the belief that he was a military genius, as well as a love of basketball.  Her influence was seen everywhere from the cartoons of her that suddenly started appearing on TV to the way her sons were promoted and moved up the ranks, Field stated. In the s Kim was sent to live and study at the International School of Bern in Switzerland under a  identity. This was done in the hope that exposure to the West would turn him into a reformer - but the author said the opposite was true. She told Vox: What his time in Switzerland must have taught him is thatit wasn’t for the family myth and family dynasty, he’d be a nobody. Knowing that without his connections he would be another ordinary, chubby immigrant kid going to school and struggling with his math homework, he decided to perpetuate the system.  Although he would kick and spit on his fellow students in fits of anger and frustration, Field said there is no evidence of Kim being a pyschopath - and he did make four close friends. He would regularly play basketball after school, watched by his uncle and aunt who acted as his s. They would set up picnic-like chairs and cheer him on - something classmates found odd.When he did take over from his father in , many thought the dynasty would collapse within months. But Field writes that his every move is calculated to ensure he stays in power.  Under Kim, the country carried out its first successful hydrogen bomb test in , and has developed a new generation of cyber hackers. Field believes that Kim is very consciously trying to look like his grandfather, who is still revered in North Korea. And Kimaposs ruthlessness has not seen members of his immediate family spared. Half-brother Kim Jong-nam died after being attacked with a nerve agent at Kuala Lumpar International Airport in Malasia in . While his death is regarded officially as an assassination, it is thought of by many as a public execution.  Although it has never been proved, Kim is believed to have ordered the killing, believing his half-brother was a threat. Four North Korean suspects left the airport shortly after the assassination and left Korea without being arrested. And his uncle Jang Song Thaek - described in North Korean media as despicable human scum, worse than a dog - was reportedly fed to  hungry dogs in .

Staff at Tobe Zoo in Ehime, south Japan carried out the emergency drill on Saturday. Instead of using a real lion an employee donned a furry suit and large mascot head. The clip begins with the ferocious beast wandering somewhat aimlessly down a concrete road. After looking around dubiously for some prey, it opts to walk away from four men holding up a net with poles.    An official looking man in a blue unorm does eventually catch the big cataposs eye, prompting the King of the Jungle to race towards him. The man is thrown backwards but fortunately his colleagues hold firm, rebuffing the flesh hungry mammal.    A small white van then appears and crawls alongside of the lion. Out of its windows a zoo worker aims a gun towards at the brown and yellow animal, firing a singular shot.    As a pair of real lions look on, the mascot-like feline staggers to the floor. A long poll is threaded through the window which pokes the animal, making sure it is firmly out of action before workers rush over to restrain them.    Mascot costume culture is particularly prominent in Japan. Yuru-chara for example, is just one category of many mascot categories. With unsophisticated and cute looks, yuru-chara characters represent towns and their history, culture or produce.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"high street fashions boost charity funds","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHigh Street style and a good cause drew fashion-conscious ladies from miles around to Lochgilphead Joint Campus.The Mid Argyll group of the Marie Curie charity hosted a special fundraising fashion show on Monday June  in association with Colours.An audience of around  eager shoppers were treated to fashion items from shoes to cardigans and handbags to floaty summer skirts, all well known brands at discount prices.The evening, which included a raffle featuring excellent prizes, raised around £, for Marie Curie, which offers support to people and families affected by terminal illness.Jenny Brolly of the Mid Argyll Marie Curie fundraising group said: #Once again thanks to the community for turning out to support Marie Curie.#An enjoyable evening was had by everyone.#"},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The school, which is at the heart of more than  new homes at Letham Mains, is being funded entirely through developersrsquo contributions.Morrison Construction, which is also behind the development of the nearby East Lothian Community Hospital, was appointed to build the primary school, which will have  classrooms suitable for pre-school and primary teaching, a dining hall, social space and a two-court PE hall with retractable seating for performance and community use.Now the foundations and concrete base have been completed and the steel frame is being put in place.As part of the projectrsquos commitment to sustainability,  tonnes of ground soil taken from the site have been moved to other projects in the county, including a BMX track in Musselburgh.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, a Haddington ward member and cabinet spokeswoman for education, visited the site to meet with Morrison Constructionrsquos team there.She said: ldquoItrsquos great to see the progress that is being made on the new school.ldquoHaddington is growing, with people choosing to live here because itrsquos a lovely town with beautul natural settings and good transport links within the county and wider region.ldquoItrsquos important that we keep up with the pace of growth, have facilities in place to accommodate it, and ensure our wider community benefits from it.ldquoI look forward to ing to Letham Mains Primary School later in the construction process as it continues to take shape.Outside the new building, areas will be designed for outdoor learning, PE and play.Jim Hanna, Morrison Construction project director, said: ldquoIt was great to be joined by council representatives on site so they could see the progress we are making.ldquoWith groundworks and foundations complete, we are now under way with the steel frame for the new building which will start to provide the community with a sense of what the school will look like once delivered.ldquoMorrison Construction is committed to minimising the impact of our activities on the environment and local community.ldquoAlready during the project we have been able to ert hundreds of tonnes of soil from landfill for reuse at Musselburgh, and we look forward to maintaining a proactive approach to sustainability throughout our time at Letham Mains."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-musselburgh-gala-2019","story":"Organised by Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, the fun-packed event is adored by youngsters in the Honest Toun.From noon until pm, there is a range of activities on offer including shows, quad bikes, face painting and dance displays.Edinburgh magician Alexander the Great will enthral gala visitors with his magic and circus skills show and Dinky Donuts will be present to keep those hunger pangs at bay.East Coast FM lead the fun and games as compegraveres.Also present will be Musselburghrsquos Army Cadets, Air Cadets and Sea Cadets, with musical entertainment provided by the Penicuik and Musselburgh Boysrsquo Brigade Pipe Band.Representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership will also be on hand to discuss its work with the local community.The Brunton Bistro serves tea, coffee, sandwiches and pies in a marquee.For those who prefer a snack as they enjoy the many activities, Sizzlers are selling food such as burgers, bacon rolls and chips.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us!

the rise in the number of homes being brought back into use, which is down to the hard work and expertise of empty homes officers.ldquoI want to see this expertise working across the whole of

areas have the highest percentage of vacant homes, with around .% of properties in the Western Isles long-term empty, compared to .% across Scotland.Reducing their number is seen as key to strengthening fragile communities and bringing affordable housing back on to the market.A new service launched in the Western Isles in October  ndash and run by the council with support from the SEHP

laws to allow them to force the sale of empty homes under certain circumstances.The Scottish Liberal Democrats have called for the introduction of a help-to-renovate loan in a bid to speed up the

The country is faced with a profound crisis in the form of the distinct possibility of departure from the EU without a deal.What do our MPs plan to do  It is reported that the poor souls, unable to agree on a Brexit plan, are likely to decide that they need another long holiday. One wonders at times what kind of parallel universe many of these politicians live on.The EU Council President, Donald Tusk, when announcing the extension to October , urged the UK not to \"waste this time\". Clearly, the EU was looking to the UK for the situation to be addressed with some urgency and determination after three years of self-indulgence. Instead, with bemusement, it has had to look on as the Tories go through their labyrinthine procedures to elect a new leader and, meanwhile, the UK is without a Prime Minister with any real authority. If our politicians keep this up, the Conservative and Labour parties are unlikely to avoid another firm spanking from the electorate when the voters are given the chance to record their views at a General Election.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.JEREMY Hunt calls for live public debates between Boris Johnson and himself before, wait for it, the Tory Party members vote.This matter is now an internal Tory party issue. The general public has no vote, ergo the Tories should look to another means to reach out to their members.They should call an extraordinary party congress run by themselves and hold it in camera. That would spare us all having to listen. The two candidates can address their members there, answer questions from the floor and sell their programme and contact each member by a prospectus and release a copy to the press. Simple.The last thing the public need at this stage is for money from the public broadcaster to assist this internal party stramash!John Edgar, Kilmaurs.RUTH Marr has, predictably, laid into Boris Johnson when he has not even won yet . This attitude is derived from the Nicola Sturgeon \"charm\" book which is to take the worst possible statistics and use them as a political weapon. Examples being the \" per cent\" of Scots voting to remain in  which does not take into account the total number of potential voters and the claim that \"up to , jobs will be lost\" due to a hard Brexit. which is essentially meaningless.What Scotland actually cannot afford is independence and for a very cogent reason. It seems to have been forgotten that part of the reason for Brexit was that the UK economy was paying in far more to Brussels than we got out. Conversely, Scotland was awarded a larger share of this money. If Scotland were independent, and wanted to rejoin the European Union, we would be asked to contribute more than we get out because Nicola Sturgeon has emphasised just how \"wealthy\" Scotland really is. The SNP will find EU membership is a much harder sell back here. What then Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IrsquoM a wee bit fed up of hearing the claim, expressed on your Letters Pages , that remain supporters in the Scottish independence debate are a ldquosilent majority.In the  referendum, there were very strong feelings on both sides, strongly and eloquently expressed on both sides. The Unionist cause had erstwhile Chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the big beast that is Gordon Brown speaking on its behalf. Blair McDougall, chief strategist for Remain, appeared frequently on BBC and STV chat shows, and the darling of the Conservative Party, Ruth Davison, after  touted as a possible Prime Minister ,was much photographed and much quoted. Celebrity endorsements from figures as erse as Sir David Attenborough and Eddie Izzard also received maximum publicity. In homes and colleges and cafes and pubs all over Scotland, debate raged, both sides making their case with equal passion.Itrsquos a moot point whether in Scotland Unionists are still a majority, but they are most certainly not silent.Angus Ferguson, Glasgow G."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-of-the-day-how-is-scotland-doing-on-its-climate-change-promises","story":"But a lot can change in a decade.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Mackies ice cream is used in Bubble Teas\"  Asian Tea Craze helps Mackie’s scoop record salesviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"CLAN Cancer Support\"  Lottery grant for cancer charity viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sc launches new children s activities programme","story":"Garioch Sports Centrethis week announced that it islaunching GSCkids, a new programme of children#s activities, in a bid to make children#s activities more accessible in the local area.Launching on Wednesday, August , children will still be able to enjoy their favourites, including additional football classes, and some new additions including Junior Boxercise.GSC will also be offering preschool gymnastics classes in partnership with Donside Gymnastics for the very first time.Sandra Simpson of Donside Gymnastics commented: “We’re delighted to be launching five brand new preschool gymnastics classes at Garioch Sports Centre. “Classes are suitable from .- years old and are the \u2028perfect pathway into our school-age gymnastics programme.”Garioch Sports Centre’s Kevin Bonarius, chief operating officer, added: ‘The aim of GSCkids is to provide a safe and inclusive environment for local children and their families and carers to enjoy active lestyles while having fun.“Our doors are open to children of all ages and abilities.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Of those, nine were classed as early retirements.This meant that #strain costs# amounting to £, had to be paid from their departments of employment directly into the pension fund in order to recoup the cost of early retirement payments.Asked how many of these employees came from the SFL service, an OIC spokeswoman confirmed that seven had worked for the education service, but could not disclose how many were specically from the SFL or what portion of the money was attributable to their redundancy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon. He will also sign copies of From Scuttle to Salvage at The Orcadian Bookshop on June , from am to pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HM Coastguard said the ordnance was found on the seabed during an underwater survey yesterday.The discovery was made just a day after a series of commemorative events took place at Scapa Flow to mark the centenary of the scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet, which left  men killed.On Friday, ers from the Royal Navy and the German Navy went underwater to lay wreaths at the site, where more than  German warships were deliberately sunk by their commander at the end of the Second World War so as to prevent them being ided up amongst Allied forces.In the wake of the weekend discovery, a military explosives ordnance disposal team was dispatched from Glasgow. The group is expected to carry out an assessment to make the device safe.An exclusion zone has been set up in the area, with warning signs erected urging people to stay at least  metres away from the waters between Hoy and Cava.Kaimes Beasley, duty controller for HM Coastguard said: \"With weather in the area likely to be good, its more than possible that e charter boats will want to go there, but our strong advice is to keep away.\"Scapa Flow is one of Scotland’s most popular e sites, thanks to the number of British and German wartime relics lying on the seabed.It is not the first time that a torpedo has been discovered in the area. Three years ago, Royal Navy bomb disposal experts were sent to detonate an ordinance thought to have been fired at HMS Royal Oak by a German U-boat in . A total of  men were killed in the naval disaster.During the initial detonation, a section of the bomb containing its own explosive charge broke free and appeared on the surface of the water.However, the Royal Navy team carried out a second controlled explosion to destroy it.The German High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow following Armistice in November  while negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles were ongoing.Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter was in command of the  vessels - viewed as a threat to the UKs dominance at sea - but had not been informed of a last-minute extension to finalise details of the deal.He did not want the assets shared among foreign powers without the German governments consent and was struggling with a mutinous, embarrassed and increasingly bored crew.With the previous deadline for a treaty passed, he issued an order to scuttle the ships.The admiral was made a prisoner of war but his act of defiance was celebrated in Germany.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm we are poorly served by a political class devoid of self doubt","story":"Alex Salmond waged war on nuance five years ago, and the equally certain Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are keeping up the good fight, writes Euan McColm. Admirers of the high art of comedy may be familiar with an especially brilliant sketch written and performed by David Mitchell and Robert Webb. The pair – dressed in Germany army unorms – are on a World War Two battlefield, preparing an attack. Webb’s character, puffed up and confident, puts down a field telephone, and declares, “They’re coming. Now we’ll see how these Russians deal with a crack SS ision.”As distant gunfire echoes, Mitchell’s character approaches, nervously clears his throat, and begins, “Hans…”“Have courage, my friend,” says Webb’s alpha.“Yeah, eh, Hans, I’ve just noticed something,” comes the reply.“These communists are all cowards.”“Have you looked out our caps, recently ” asks Mitchell’s beta.“Our caps ”“The badges on our caps, have you looked at them ”“What  No… a bit.”With an anguished look on his face, Mitchell’s character continues, “They’ve got skulls on them. Have you noticed that our caps have actually got little pictures of skulls on them ”“I don’t, um…”“Hans,” Mitchell’s soldier continues, tentatively, “…are we the baddies ”There is more to come and I urge you,you haven’t seen it, to seek out the sketch, online. It is masterful stuff that endures almost  years after it was first broadcast on the double act’s BBC Two sketch show.Perhaps what makes this sketch so timeless, beyond the excellence of the performances, is that it captures something with which we can all identy. Which of us hasn’t, at some crucial point in our lives, been stricken by a moment of crushing self-doubt  Which of us hasn’t wondered whether, maybe, we are in the wrong I watched the sketch again last week and it occurred to me that it could not be more relevant, right now.Self-examination has never been so unfashionable uncertainty is a weakness to be deplored . Among the political classes, absolute certainty must be maintained, even in the face of crushing evidence that destroys one’s assertions.Think of the bluster of former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, who led the war against nuance during ’s independence referendum campaign. Any dficult question about how he might oversee the break-up of the UK was dismissed by Salmond as part of a “Project Fear” campaign designed to terry voters who might not have believed independence to be in Scotland’s best interests. Salmond’s aggressive reaction to legitimate inquiry created a culture in the Yes campaign where the done thing was not to consider the question but to question the motives of the questioner. After all, since we could be certain that independence would be a very good thing with no downsides, anyone who suggested otherwise must have had malice in their hearts. Of course Scotland would retain its EU membership after voting Yes, insisted Salmond, in the face of remarks from the EU that contradicted him. Of course an independent Scotland would enter into a currency union with what was left of the UK, despite assurances from the then chancellor and his Westminster shadows that no such arrangement would or could take place. Of course Scotland, standing proudly alone, would be wealthy and prosperous, even though the price of North Sea oil – on which this assertion was based – was plummeting.This absolute certainty infected the Yes campaign which, often, mistook angry shouting for debate and went on to discover that it needed more than blind faith to persuade a majority of Scots to support the independence project.A year later, as Donald Trump ramped up his campaign to become American President, dangerous certainty reached a new, even more disturbing level. Evidence of Trump’s misdeeds – things like film and audio recordings and paperwork that, by any standard, proved he was unsuitable for the role he sought – was rejected by the candidate as “fake news” and his supporters, so utterly convinced that Trump would make good on his promise to “make America great again”, accepted his words as truth. To question Trump’s claims was to be a traitor.And in , the same characterisation of doubt as weakness proved invaluable to Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson as they bluffed their way to victory in the referendum on EU membership. Their every proclamation about “freedom” and “sovereignty” was accepted, without question, by their disciples. Self-reflection can be a painful business it’s hardly surprising that we are so uncomfortable about doing it. It’s so much easier to blame a former partner for the break down of a relationship than it is to consider whether our own behaviour might have played its part. It’s comforting to think that we missed out on a promotion because the interviewer had it in for us rather than because, maybe, another candidate was better suited. Over recent weeks, we’ve listened as contenders to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and, by extension, Prime Minister of the UK, have set out their “plans” to achieve Brexit where Theresa May failed. With the honourable exception of Rory Stewart, whose decision to engage with reality rather than to rely on fantasy ruled him wholly unsuitable for the \u2028job, these men relied on loud declarations of certainty to maintain their campaigns.The final two candidates – Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt– are still at it. They’re still telling us they can get a new deal out of the EU, even as the EU insists the withdrawal agreement struck with Theresa May is the only one available.Hunt and Johnson – or, more accurately, the parade of lickspittle MPs who have appeared in the media in his stead while he hides from scrutiny –continue to assert, with bullet-proofed certainty, that they have plans to make a success of Brexit when all the evidence says that they damned well do not.The certainty of politicians comes with a large dollop of nauseating moral superiority on top.

Only delivering Brexit on  October cannormality to British politicsExactly three years ago this morning I walked out of Milbank Tower, Westminster, after an all-night party arranged to take in the results of the UK’s EU referendum.I had a smile as bright as the dawn and wide as the Thames itself. We had only gone and done it the campaign to leave the European Union had blown the bloody doors off. British politics would never be the same again.I was always confident about the outcome of the referendum and repeatedly cheered-up my less optimistic colleagues that they were in the process of making history. Although behind in the polls for most of the campaign the cross-party and non-party coalition of Leave supporters had at least three advantages that gave us an underlying edge. The first was Prime Minister David Cameron had been poorly treated by the European Union’s political elite who stupidly dismissed his attempt to show he could win reforms. This was a serious political misjudgement by Merkel, Hollande, Juncker, Tusk and their aloof colleagues, displaying a symptomatic arrogance and condescension that continues to this day. Had they conceded deliverable reforms demonstrating a willingness to decentralise and loosen their inexorable drive towards ever closer union then the Leave campaign would have had a far harder fight on its hands.• : Nicola Sturgeon: Chances of no Brexit now more likelyAlthough Cameron’s shuttle diplomacy is mostly forgotten now its repudiation set the context in which the referendum would be played out – the British looking for the repatriation for more controlsagainst a European establishment who had stopped listening and paid only lip-service to keep troublesome natives docile.The second advantage was that there was not one campaign to Leave – but many. While Vote Leave eventually won the official designation to run the Leave campaign the competition to win the designation that came first from Leave.EUand latterly from Grassroots Out, meant there was not one strategy reaching out to voters but three. In addition, a long list of dedicated groups that had been campaigning for at least a generation, such as The Freedom Association, Bruges Group and Global Britain had been joined by the likes of Labour Leave to reach out to people that might otherwise have fallen off a centralised campaign grid. Together with UKIP members – a party originally founded by the Scot Professor Alan Sked in response to the Maastricht Treaty, and then made politically successful by Nigel Farage – they also provided boots on the ground that were willing to work with the many Conservatives who took the brave pills and opposed their leader and Prime Minister.It is thanks to the happenstance of this hydra-headed approach that the Leave result was achieved despite the official campaign, rather than because of it.• : Brexit deal is dead: Prepare for No Deal vs No Brexit – Brian WilsonThe third advantage was the solely negative approach taken by the Remain group, which learned nothing from the almost fatal negativity of the Better Together campaign in the Scottish referendum. After dropping any mention of Cameron’s fudged and worthless reforms George Osborne, Nick Clegg, George Carney and their lieutenants relied upon a constant feed of scaremongering and doom-laden reports, forecasts and supercharged extrapolations of unreliable predictions to frighten voters of what might come – not just in the future but “immediately following” a vote to leave. Just as many of the similar threats did not cut through in the Scottish referendum they failed dismally to motivate support for the European project that had been the common purpose of the global political elite and their civil servants since the Second World War. Even rolling out President Obama worked against British pugnaciousness. Most economic threats were seen as out of touch and simply not believed, but where they might have ben effective were still dismissed as irrelevant – people wanted control of their lives back. That is why cities such as Sunderland and Derby with their Nissan and Toyota car plants, or Redcar with its closing steel mill, still voted Leave – and still support it today.That the UK should go on to create over , new jobs in the following three years and maintain its lead in attracting Foreign Direct Investment ahead of Germany and Francedemonstrated who really lied in the referendum. Nor should we forget the Remain campaign outspent the Leave campaign by £.m to .m not counting the Government’s own pamphlet that cost £.m to print and distribute to m households before expenses rules kicked-in. The result was determined not by money but by having messages that chimed with what ious voters thought.The fallout since that day three years ago has been immense.Cameron broke his promise to stay only for another remainer, Theresa May, to replace him unchallenged. Her litany of broken promises are well recorded and I offer no sympathy for it must be understood, she dealt her own hand and then played it badly. It was she who relegated her government from a working majority to an imploding minority she who chose the strategy of repeated concessions over the advice of her ministers tasked with the negotiations and she who refused to listen when confronted with defeat, after defeat, after defeat.Instead of capitalising on the Conservative failure Jeremy Corbyn has preicated so often that Labour politicians compete to claim which direction he faces– Leave or Remain, second referendum or general election  Likewise the SNP has become trapped in the Leave headlights, fooling itself that Brexit can deliver independence rather than seeking to deliver a successful government.Having retired, believing his job was done, Nigel Farage has come back and formed the Brexit Party which has earned him the plaudit of bringing down two prime ministers without him even being in the House of Commons. Now he must hold the feet of Boris Johnson orJeremy Hunt to the fire. Farage has identied what the British people have been saying for years – our political leaders cannot be trusted – and it is a rich seam to be mined. The EU referendum has reset British politics. If Labour turns its back on leave voters it will lose seats in the North. If the Tories don’t deliver Brexit by  October they will lose seats wholesale. Only once the referendum result is delivered in a form recognisable to its supporters can politics be reset again, by which time it may well be unrecognisable.• Brian Monteith is an MEP-elect for the Brexit Party©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon absolutely confident scots are ready to vote for independence","story":"The SNP leader today said choosing Boris Johnson as prime minister would be disastrous for the Conservatives, particularly in Scotland.

My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars.

A deep free-kick headed back across goal fell invitingly for Oates to clinically drill the ball home, before another quick counter-attack saw Daniel Simpson fire home after Lee Gale’s shot had been blocked.Their misery was complete when a long ball pumped forward saw Swanson misjudge, allowing Oates to complete his hat-trick at the second attempt.Shetland manager Kevin Main said after the match that he was #sick of hard luck stories this week#.#It was an extremely competitive match and one we were expecting. They won this competition two years ago, we watched that final and they’re a physically strong bunch of boys#.Despite the defeat, Main#s players can be proud of their exploits and he added: #“It#s been an absolutely incredible week.#It#s been full of full of highs#.This fourth place finish represents Shetland#s best footballing performance at an island games since winning the gold medal at the home games in . raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"shetland footballers lose in anglesey football tournament semi finals ","story":"Shetland keeper Grant Wood saves well to keep out an attack.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyFatal road crash: Our hearts and prayers are with family, says MP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"this is how many points you ll get on your licence for these driving offences","story":"Drivers who accumulate  or more penalty points from motoring offences within a three-year period can face a ban from driving for up to six months, while six or more penalty points within two years of passing your driving test can lead to a license withdrawal and a re-test requirement.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history.

He told the : “This has been an ongoing campaign for me and my constituents who use this Junction sometimes on a daily basis .“ I first contacted DFI Roads some years ago in September  when they told me that due to recent collisions an investigation was under way. “They also informed me at that time they had a scheme proposal under development with a number of options being considered. “Writing back to them a year later in  DFI Roads then stated they hoped to be in a position to compete for funding in the next three years works programme which was being developed at the time. “By  we then managed to convince DFI Roads to put in place a number of additional measures at the junction. “New Junction warning signs and Slow markings were provided along with new enhanced signage on the Woodtown Rd.”Mr. Frew said that DFI Roads are now proposing to spend pound, on upgrading the junction although he did not specy an actual timeline of when the work will take place.

In a specially commissioned visual, the iconic clfs of Fairhead in County Antrim have been digitally transformed into an eye-catching sculpture featuring the images of local golfing greats, past and present. Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, who will all now be competing in the tournament, feature in the design, alongside former Open Champion and Portrush man Fred Daly. Engaging the talents of Hollywood digital CGI artist Mike Campau, the tongue-in-cheek stunt has been designed to reflect how Northern is truly ‘Made for Golf’, illustrated not only by our sporting talents but also in our landscapes and rugged coast. The timing of the tribute could not be more fitting as Northern Ireland golfers celebrate their recent triumphs on the course, with Rory McIlroy winning the Canadian Open by seven shots to secure his th PGA Tour title and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowellafter finishing tied eighth on  under. Tourism NI last week marked the last official stop of a -mile community engagement campaign ‘The Epic Journey to The th Open’, and with just a month to go, Open fever is starting to take a grip of the nation as the spotlight falls on Portrush. Tourism NI Marketing Director Naomi Waite said: “With ‘Open fever’ beginning to take a hold, we wanted to honour the global golfing heroes who collectively have played a key role in bringing The th Open to Northern Ireland and, through their talent, have made Northern Ireland a growing international golf destination. It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years. The th Open at Royal Portrush will be beamed to over  million viewers across the world and is set to attract , spectators, with a team of , staff and  volunteers warmly welcoming visitors. Unprecedented demand from fans has led to record-breaking ticket sales and the event will be a sell-out on Championship Days for the first time. Rory McIlroy commented: “The Open ing to Portrush is massive for Northern Ireland - everyone is so excited and is getting behind it. I never thought I would have the opportunity to play in a major championship at home and I’m really looking forward to it.” Fans can still book their place at Royal Portrush on Practice Days with a limited number of new official hospitality packages also remaining on sale.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

insurance mechanism from the Withdrawal Agreement unless it had been demonstrated how such arrangements would work in practice to ensure there are no customs checks on the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .A new body of experts has been set up in the UK to look at potential alternative arrangements.Read MoreExtent of Irish north-south cooperation revealed in secret Brexit impact mapping exercise reportFuture PM seeking to delay Brexit would face EU hostility – VaradkarExpert  appointed to advise UK government on alternative arrangements for Irish border after BrexitMany Brexiteers believe technological solutions could replace the backstop. But Mr Varadkar said he could not see evidence of arrangements being outlined before the October  deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"22 northern ireland schools could close because

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland.

Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

Therefore the comments by Mark Rutte today were utterly uninformed and careless.“Mr Rutte may not realise, but only  days ago the same republican terrorist ideology which bombed the border checkpoints  years ago, attempted to murder a police officer in Belfast.“The desire for murder is not driven by pro-EU sentiments or anti-Brexit sentiments but by a deep sectarian hatred of Britishness.“If Mr Rutte and his fellow EU leaders really want to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland, then they will not impose a deal which all unionists in Northern Ireland reject.“They will work for a sensible deal which everyone can support.“Building a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom would run absolutely contrary to the Belfast Agreement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"half of northern ireland population neither unionist nor nationalist survey says","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They had much more success once they had their best forwards on the field. They probably scored enough to give them hope that they can still make the Super s.Declan Bonners side were also retaining the title for the first time since . But as this group of players look forward to the Super s in which they will be in the same group as Kerry, they will be aiming to go one better than in  and reach the All-Ireland semi-final.Cavan opted for a defensive side drafting in Ciaran Brady and Gerald Smith – who replaced corner-forwards Cian Mackey and Conor Madden. Obviously the strategy of team boss Mickey Graham was to stay in the hunt for as long as possible and then unleash more of their forward power.In the event both sides set up defensively – Cavan pulled  men behind the ball when not in possession while Donegal did one better and pulled everybody back.Read how the game unfolded:  []jsdjs.src\"embed.scribblelive widgets embed.js\"ijs"},{"url":null,"title":"maire hendron when contentious issues arose in council it was important to work with all the parties it was very unpleasant at times","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She will take over from leader Naomi Long when she takes her seat in the European Parliament next month..pushQ. How do you feel about going back into politics after a break of just over four years A. I am excited about going back. It is a challenge and I feel I have skills that will enable me to make a contribution to the role.I am very keen that the Assembly should be restored and I believe that the public is crying out for devolved government again to deal with all the problems which are mounting up.Q. You must be delighted at the partys performance in the local government and European elections.A. I am absolutely delighted. We were so pleased at the results of the local government elections. It was particularly pleasing to see so many young people full of enthusiasm come forward and stand for election alongside the more experienced candidates.We were hopeful for the European election that Naomi would be a success but we never believed she would be the overwhelming success she was.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetI am sure that everyone watching the results saw Naomi make straight for my husband Jim when she arrived at the count. That was because he was her agent in all but two of her election contests.Q. How do you see the future for the party given its recent successes A. I just hope that the success continues and that the party will continue to grow.It is up to the young members to keep that momentum going and make sure that it doesnt fizzle out as we have seen with other parties. I believe there is enough commitment and enthusiasm there to allow us to progress. Maybe this is our time.Q. Were you always active in politics A. Not at all. When Oliver Napier approached Jim about forming a new party we had a very young family - a baby of six months and two other children aged two and five.Jim was part of a group of  who was involved in the planning for the new party, work which went on for six to nine months before Alliance was launched.While he was very much a behind the scenes figure I was very supportive of him. However, I just wanted to rear my children and had no desire to be an elected politician.I did run for election in east Belfast in the s but I knew there was no possibility of getting elected. Really, I was just doing it to see what level of support we had at the polls and to give our supporters a choice.Q. Was that the start of your career in active politics A. Not at all. Before I had my family I was a home economics teacher, but I gave it up when they were really small.When all of them were at primary school I went back to teaching at Rathmore Grammar School in south Belfast, where I remained until I retired in .I believe that it has become something of a neglected subject in schools as it teaches pupils many things and especially about healthy eating, which is a major topic nowadays.Q. But a decade later you ed to politics.A. In  I was persuaded to run as a candidate in the Pottinger ward in east Belfast for a seat on the City Council. I thought I had no chance of success and was quite shocked when I won a seat and I served on the council for  years until losing my seat in .The first term, which was leading up to the transformation of local government, lasted six years, and in the second term I topped the poll in Pottinger, something no non-unionist had ever done before.I did work very hard and attended a lot of constituency events and did a lot of case work for people. My name became quite well-known and,modesty allows me to say it, respected in the area.It was during the second term that I was elected Deputy Lord Mayor of Belfast. We had six Alliance councillors of which I was the group leader and I also chaired a number of working groups.For a very long time Alliance had held the balance of power in the council and when contentious issues arose the party felt it had a responsibility to lead the way on these discussions.I found it very important to work with all the parties. Certainly it was very unpleasant at times when the temperature rose over contentious issues which were being discussed.Q. How do you think your role turned out A. That may be for someone  to say. However, I chaired the centenaries working group which established the criteria for marking the ious centenaries we celebrated during the last decade. The first of those was the signing of the Ulster Covenant.These were delicate issues since the centenary of the  Rising was among those which occurred at that time. Yet these events went off peacefully and without any rancour, which was remarkable.I now sit on a centenaries committee in Dublin and it has adopted almost word for word the criteria used by Belfast City Council to deal with this issue.Q. Were there other successes A. I was also on a memorabilia group which looked at how the council managed the artefacts which it had acquired over the years and seethey could be displayed more coherently.Sinn Fein complained that the City Hall was too unionist in appearance. That may have been the case, but it was a building of its time.The groups work led to the creation of the History of Belfast exhibition, which is continuing on the ground floor.It tells the story of the city and its people in a factual and inoffensive way and is non-partisan.Every time I go into the City Hall I am amazed at the number of visitors who are going around the exhibition.Q. Given that you came to elected politics relatively late in le, how did your family react A. They were very supportive. They were pleased and quite proud when I was elected a councillor and are quite amazed that I am now going to be called an MLA. I have three children, two sons and a daughter, and  delightful grandchildren. None of my children still live in Northern Ireland, but of course they keep in touch with what Jim and I do.Q. Had you a political background A. I was brought up in the Co Antrim village of Cloughmills and neither my father nor mother were involved in politics. Community relations in the village were good for the most part.Although I was not brought up in a political family, as I grew up I became aware of the isions in society, although I had friends of every point of view.Throughout my le I have mixed well and have had no problems.Jim and I used to talk with friends about the possibility of getting enough people together to form a non-partisan party and then Oliver Napier came to him with the proposal about what was to become the Alliance Party.Both of them, along with the other founding members, were completely committed to breaking down the political isions in Northern Ireland.Q. You have also been involved in that peace-building work A. I chaired the Good Relations Partnership for a number of years. I wanted to see what was going on at street level and how European peace funding was being used to best effect.I found many people of similar mind to myself who were working away at breaking down barriers between the communities.There are many unsung heroes in Belfast and other areas that the general public are not aware of.Q. How did you and your husband meet A. It was at a party in Malone House in what must have been towards the end of . We married the following year and have been married for  years. He was a solicitor, which was a great help when I left work to rear the children as he kept the money coming in.That prevented him wanting to become an elected politician, although he has been chairman and president of the party.Q. Alliance had something of a middle-class image. Was that a true reflection of the party A. I remember being a little angry when I heard someone on the BBC describe Alliance as the \"wine and cheese party\". They obviously had never seen us trying to raise funds by holding jumble sales in dusty church halls.\u2029Q. How do you relax A. We like to get away to our little cottage in Donegal when possible, but it seems that something always occurs which prevents us going.In recent times it has been very busy with two elections so we are definitely going to get away before I take up my new role."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38246577.ece/54e2d/BINARY/BT_K7428.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts roads closed in dunmurry security alert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m.

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"key events in the tory leadership contest this week","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas. So, Conor McBride and the rest of the group jumped at the chance and found themselves there last week in advance of the Tyson Fury v Tom Schwarz heavyweight bout.Conor told the Derry News: “While we were in Las Vegas, I had the idea to visit the Mayweather gym as James and myself are both big boxing fans. Mayweather’s boxing club is one of the most famous in the world. We both knew it would be a once in a letime experience so we grabbed it with both hands.”The young Creggan man continued: “I used to box in my younger years so that’s where my love of the sport began.”In fact, sport and general fitness is a huge part of his everyday le.  Conor is a personal trainer by profession working at Puregym on the Strand Road and a fully qualied British Boxing Board of Control coach who holds a BScin Sport’s and Exercise Physiology from the University of Central Lancashire.The Derry News asked him what it was like to rub shoulders with some of the biggest names in boxing at its most glamorous location in Las Vegas googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe said: “The experience was amazing-listening and watching Floyd Mayweather Snr at work was incredible.“He talked about the ‘shoulder roll’ which his son Floyd Mayweather Jr, arguably one of the best boxers of all time, is famous for.“We also met Jacob ‘Stitch’ Duran, one of the world’s leading ‘cutmen’ and had a good chat with him as well.“On top of that we went to the Tyson Fury and Tom Schwarz fight which was an amazing experience and met some of the other boxers on the bill.

So, my coach and GB coaches suggested I give it a go this year. My shoot was what won the event.ldquoI was neck and neck with the previous British champion most of the way round.

Suzie has an extremely busy summer ahead of her and is so looking forward to the challenges ahead.ldquoMy focus now is Traithle Europeans in June in Madeira, then Worlds in Florida in October.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years. The first set of minors he was involved with were probably the likes of Conor Woods, so, itrsquos going back a bit.ldquoHaving him there with what people would probably say is a relatively inexperienced management team as well as a relatively inexperienced team on the field of play has become very important, he added.ldquoWe see this as a bit of a journey over the next two to three years and Diarmuid being there to help build along the way will make a massive dference. Sheehan also believes that OrsquoSullivan has made a big impact on the players and he canrsquot praise him highly enough.ldquoIn terms of his knowledge of the game and the wee bits of coaching he does around how to tackle, there have been huge strides, Sheehan said.ldquoTackling was definitely something we felt we needed to work on, we were giving away too many frees in the past. You can see the dference even in the way the likes of Tom Murray, only  and Darragh Mallon at , are playing like demons, he beamed.ldquoThe other thing be brings is a great calmness on match days.The lads respond well to that, when he has a quiet word with them beforehand.This will be Downrsquos fourth appearance in the Christy Ring final, but they have only lted the cup once and that was back in ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New working group to run local mountain bike trails  ","story":"A NEW working group is to be established to assist with the management of the hugely popular mountain bike trails in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is keen to meet with those who use the trails and organise local events, alongside representatives from Cycling Ireland, to discuss what have been described as a number of challenges in managing the facility and sister trails in Rostrevorrsquos Kilbroney Forest Park.Over pound.m has been invested in developing trails in both parks and together they attract over one million users each year, with pound, invested annually in their management.The success of both authorised and unauthorised trails within both parks presents challenges for Newry, Mourne and Down Council, members of its Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee were told on Monday.The local authority manages the bike trails under licence from the Forest Service and is also responsible for their maintenance.Politicians were told that in addition to the authorised trail network, an unofficial or lsquonaturalrsquo network also exists and has been in place for many years.

Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver. It’s the most important three or four hours of the week to win that fiver.”Links To The Past: Pioneers Of Ulster Golf is on BBC Two Northern Ireland tomorrow night at pm.The one-hour film has been produced by NPE Media for BBC Northern Ireland, with support from the Ulster-Scots Broadcast Fund.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"this is how much it costs to get married in northern ireland  ","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           This is how much it costs to get married in Northern Ireland   Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...BRIGHTCOVE.createBrightcovePlayerInstance Helen JohnsonEmail Published::Friday  June Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Human Interest\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

The application area also stretches or borders on  Areas of Special Scientic Interest from the boundaries of Belfast Lough to the glacial peat deposits of Benburb.“We have serious concerns about the impact oil and gas exploration will have on bioersity, on intensying our reliance on carbon-heavy industry and on people and communities here. “We consider this a regionally signicant application and, as such, the decision is likely to be taken by the Department for the Economy. “It is important that the Department hears and understands the strength of opposition to these proposals,” they said calling for the restoration of an Executive.Cllr O’Hanlon said: “Where we dfered with Councillor Lavery is that he sought to form a Council view in a Council Committee when the correct prcedure is to formally bring a notion of motion to Full Council.We advised Councillor Lavery of the proper process and said we would support such a motion. “The SDLP are opposed to fracking, just as we are opposed to parties trying to form council policy in the wrong manner.“Procedures are there to protect the public and good governance and we will continue to follow those rules.”\"  \"  N.I. railway line

My husband tends to do the cooking during the week otherwise he knows he won’t get fed and although we eat healthy food there is often a glass of wine on the go.pmWe try to catch up on television shows that we need to be aware of across all the main channels.  pmThis is more indulgent time and my husband and I have a list of dramas that we stock pile, although I normally only last half an hour before falling asleep.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
