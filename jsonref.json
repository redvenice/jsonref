But that one bright wonderful moment was the space program.\u0027Four days after Apollo 11 blasted out from the John F. Kennedy Space Center, the spacecraft\u0027s Eagle module – carrying Armstrong and Aldrin – was running drastically low on fuel and urgently needed to land on the moon\u0027s surface.The module\u0027s autopilot mode had overshot the desired landing zone by some four miles, leaving the two men hurtling towards a crater filled with rocks and jagged terrain for what sure would\u0027ve made for a fatal crash landing.With the success of the mission literally in his hands, Armstrong switched off the Eagle\u0027s autopilot mode and took manual control of its reigns.Despite his heart-rate measuring at an erratic 150 BPM, Armstrong kept a cool head and a steady hand, guiding the Eagle away from the crater.

Kennedy\u0027s pledge to land an American on the moon by the end of the decade, beating the Russians to the feat. Armstrong was the first one to step out from the Eagle, coining the now iconic phrase: \u0027That\u0027s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\u0027 Reflecting on one of modern history\u0027s most incredible moments, President Donad Trump said: \u0027Few moments in our American story spark more pride than the Apollo 11 mission,\u0027 in a Space Exploration Day message. His statement reiterated the goal of sending astronauts back to the moon within five years and taking \u0027the next giant leap - sending Americans to Mars.\u0027         The Eagle lunar lander, carrying Armstrong and Aldrin, landed on the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969        The mission\u0027s success held true on President John F.

At one point, we feared we would be kidnapped.It turned out the men knew our itinerary from the IRGC, which had bugged our vehicle, intercepted our interpreter’s mobile phone and bribed our driver. They knew exactly who I was. So serious was the risk judged to be, in fact, that we were given police protection – not against criminals or terrorists, but against the Basij and other agencies of the Iranian state. In the end, the hardliners won and we felt obliged leave four days early.Yet I still have huge affection for the Iranian people. I’ve been back since and have now written a book about why Iran so distrusts the West and Britain in particular.         Mr Straw believes that misunderstanding the Iranian temperament will cause further problems          Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, pictured yesterday at a service of thanksgiving for former Cabinet Secretary Lord Heywood, said Britain will never be trusted by the current Iranian regime         According to Mr Straw, Iranians have good cause to be resentful against the ‘cunning, colonial fox’       If we are to solve the current Gulf crisis in the Strait of Hormuz, then it is crucial to understand our shared history and why Iran today behaves as it does.The book is called The English Job, for example, because of a ubiquitous phrase in Persian – ‘it’s always an English job’ – which Iranians use when things go wrong.They have good cause to be resentful against the ‘cunning, colonial fox’, as they describe us. Iran never was a British colony but that didn’t stop us exploiting the country for treasure and power.At least our colonies got roads, sewers and railways. Quite the opposite was the case in Iran. Britain and Russia, after competing with each other for control of the country, eventually struck a deal which stopped all railway building right up until the 1920s.We bribed and cajoled Iran to do our will throughout the 19th Century and early part of the 20th Century and, if that didn’t work, we landed troops.         Mr Straw has written a book as to why Iran distrusts BritainWe invaded Iran in the First World War, helping cause a catastrophic famine in the process. In the Second World War, with the Russians, we jointly occupied the country for five years from 1941-6.We deposed a Shah in 1941 and installed his weaker, more compliant son.When the Iranian parliament waged an eight-year struggle to nationalise BP’s huge refinery and vast network of oil wells, MI6 and the CIA responded by organising a successful coup against the elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, in August 1953.We helped prop up the Shah in the mid and late 1970s, even when it was obvious that he was losing popular support. Catastrophically so, in fact. In 1979, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown in a revolution led by Ayatollah Khomeini and that, in turn, led directly to the start of the Islamic Republic of Iran.But the worst was to come in 1980, when Iraq’s newly appointed president, Saddam Hussein, decided, without any justification, to invade Iran. Millions on both sides lost their lives in the bloody war that followed.The whole of the West – America, France, the UK and Russia – backed Iraq (with only Israel, improbably, supporting Iran). For eight years, Iran was effectively alone. It managed to avoid abject defeat, but this searing experience has defined everything that has happened since and shaped the attitude of those in power today.Iran’s Supreme Leader since 1989, Ali Khamenei, never ceases to preach that the West cannot be trusted. In 1980, he came close to being assassinated by a renegade Iranian terrorist group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq – once supported by Saddam and now by John Bolton, President Trump’s national security adviser – and lost the use of his right arm.The single most powerful military figure in Iran is Major-General Qasem Soleimani, the man behind the Revolutionary Guards’ seizure of the British-flagged tanker. His world view, too, was forged in the crucible of the war with Saddam.It’s Khamenei and Soleimani who now call the shots, both literally and figuratively. Iran, in their view, is fighting for its very survival.Bolton calculates that by strangling Iran through sanctions, the Islamic revolutionary regime will collapse and the government, led by President Rouhani, will come begging for a deal.This approach won’t work. It is based upon a complete misunderstanding of the Iranian psyche. Already, American pressure has strengthened hardliners such as Khamenei and Soleimani and has weakened moderates like Rouhani. An often discontented population has been unified. After two centuries of humiliation, what Iran seeks above all is respect and recognition.As I know, having been involved for three years in negotiating the first phase of nuclear talks with Iran (2003-6), if Iran is shown that respect, a deal is possible.Without that, the cat and mouse game in the Gulf and continued instability in the wider Middle East will continue.We may not like the way Iran is behaving but comprehending why they do so could prove critical. The English Job: Understanding Iran, And Why It Distrusts Britain, by Jack Straw, Biteback, £20. "},{"url":null,"title":"Washington Monument transformed stunning tribute Apollo 11 moon landing","story":"Share this article            The image of the moon is seen projected on the monument during the 17-minute light show         The third stage and CSM of the Saturn V are seen traveling toward the moon after stage separation         The Apollo 11 Lunar lander approaching to the moon is projected on the Washington Monument         The Apollo 11 Lunar lander touching down the moon is projected on the Washington Monument         Neil Armstrong\u0027s foot print on the rocky Moon is projected on the Washington Monument for the 50th anniversary At NASA\u0027s Kennedy Space Center, Aldrin showed Vice President Mike Pence the launch pad where he flew to the moon in 1969. At the same time halfway around the world, an American and two other astronauts blasted into space on a Russian rocket.

It was by Landmark curry house.         Catherine Marray, 26, booked \u0027The Old Farm House\u0027 on Bagot Street in Wavertree for a girls\u0027 weekend with her friend who was visiting from Oxford         This Wavertree property was listed as a \u0027beach front\u0027 homestay on Booking.com but turned out to be a \u0027shabby student house\u0027 with a broken toilet seat\u0027I gave it the benefit of the doubt. There was someone in there who said \u0027I will go and get the guy for you\u0027 so this guy comes down covered in paint and said he was doing some plastering.\u0027He said it would be about half an hour. He seemed alright, he was chatty. My and my friend went to the pub and went back at 7.30pm.\u0027Catherine lives in Old Swan, but wanted to book a weekend break in an apartment that would make it easy to get to and from town on her girls\u0027 weekend. She claims she didn\u0027t notice the \u0027beach front\u0027 description of this Smithdown Road property until the day of arrival, and that she just assumed it was a mistake.              The condition of the bathroom at the basic £35 a night accommodation, a mess can be seen on the sink while a mop is propped up in the cornerWell aware that she wouldn\u0027t be staying in five star accommodation for £35 a night, Catherine said she expected things to be basic.She said: \u0027I don\u0027t mind somewhere that\u0027s ey as long as it\u0027s clean because we were going to be out all day.\u0027However, when the girls returned to the property on Friday night to check into their rooms, the true state of their accommodation started to dawn on them.Catherine said: \u0027We were shown into our room and found ripped curtains a lumpy old mattress a lamp that flickered on and off.         The girls decided to stay in the room nevertheless and went out for the night\u0027The owner then passed me a single quilt cover and asked me to strip it for him as he was busy. He left another single quilt and bedding outside our room so we had to make our own bed.\u0027Heading into their room, Catherine said: \u0027We decided to go into the room, have a drink and then go out. We were like \u0027let\u0027s just power through and we can go out\u0027.\u0027The girls\u0027 room, which was described as \u0027the best in the house\u0027, had \u0027ripped black pieces of material\u0027 for curtains and lamp shades stuck on upside down.In the two bathrooms, a sink was covered in bleach, with a toilet seat snapped in half and no locks on either of the doors.Catherine claimed the property resembled a \u0027shabby student house\u0027 not a \u0027homestay\u0027 holiday let - and that she just decided to \u0027grin and bare it\u0027.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u0027s ruling coalition is forecast to win a solid majorityMr Abe has pledged to \u0027clearly stipulate the role of the Self-Defence Forces in the constitution\u0027.The provisions, imposed by the United States after World War II, are popular with the public at large, but reviled by nationalists like Mr Abe, who see them as outdated and punitive.However, any constitutional revision also requires approval in a national referendum.While the ruling coalition appeared to win voters\u0027 confidence, \u0027tough situations are still ahead,\u0027 said Koji Nakakita, professor of politics at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo.Among his imminent tasks is to \u0027smoothly\u0027 raise the consumption tax to ten percent in October as part of efforts to ease swelling social security costs in the \u0027ultra-aged\u0027 country, Nakakita said.\u0027Also, the trade dispute with the US is a headache while it\u0027s hard for Japan to make a decision on Hormuz,\u0027 he said, referring to US calls for an international flotilla to escort oil tankers through the Hormuz Strait. Mr Abe, who wants to bolster Japan\u0027s defence capability, is now proposing adding the Self-Defence Force, or Japan\u0027s military, to the war-renouncing Article 9 of the constitution. He said he is not considering running for another term.Mr Abe said resolving the decades-old issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea and signing a peace treaty with Russia would be his diplomatic priorities during the rest of his term.       Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to revise the post-war pacifist constitutionOpposition parties have focused on concerns over household finances, such as the impact from the upcoming ten per cent sales tax increase and strains on the public pension system amid Japan\u0027s ageing population.Mr Abe has led his Liberal Democratic Party to five consecutive parliamentary election victories since 2012.He has prioritised revitalising Japan\u0027s economy and has steadily bolstered the country\u0027s defences in the backdrop of North Korea\u0027s missile and nuclear threats and China\u0027s growing military presence. He also has showcased his diplomatic skills by cultivating warm ties with President Donald Trump.The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and three other liberal-leaning parties teamed up in some districts. They stressed support for gender equality and LGBT issues - areas Abe\u0027s ultra-conservative lawmakers are reluctant to back.At a polling station in Tokyo\u0027s Chuo district on Sunday, voters were ided over Abe\u0027s 6 12-year rule.A voter who identified himself only as a company worker in his 40s said he chose a candidate and a party that have demonstrated an ability to get things done, suggesting he voted for Abe\u0027s ruling party and its candidate, as \u0027there is no point in casting my vote for a party or a politician who has no such abilities.\u0027Another voter, Katsunori Takeuchi, a 57-year-old fish market worker, said it was time to change the dominance of Abe and his ultra-conservative policies.\u0027I think the ruling party has been dominating politics for far too long and it is causing damage,\u0027 he said.   Abe\u0027s LDP and its coalition partner Komeito were forecast to take between 67 and 77 of the 124 seats - about half the chamber - up for election today, according to NHK.The two parties control 70 seats in the half of the 245-seat chamber that is not being contested, putting them on track to maintain their overall majority.       While Abe has claimed victory, voter turnout is expected to be lower than 50 percent for the first time since the 1995 electionNHK\u0027s projection and similar estimates by other media are based on exit polling and other analysis.Final numbers were not expected until Monday at the earliest.\u0027The results, which were within expectations, indicated that voters chose the status quo, not a change,\u0027 Shinichi Nishikawa, professor of political science at Meiji University in Tokyo, told AFP.Abe is almost certain to stay in power until November when he will break the record for the nation\u0027s longest-serving premier held by Taro Katsura, a revered politician who served three times between 1901 and 1913.Local media also predicted that forces in favour of revising the constitution, led by Abe\u0027s LDP, were set to win close to 85 of the seats up for grabs, giving them a \u0027super majority\u0027 in the chamber.Voter turnout was expected to be lower than 50 percent for the first time since the 1995 upper house election, NHK said.\u0027I support the current government because I see no alternative,\u0027 said Yoshiko Iida, a 45-year-old beauty therapist.\u0027Opposition parties are woeful,\u0027 she told AFP. \u0027I don\u0027t want to leave power to them.\u0027Susumu Rokkaku, an 85-year-old male pensioner, said: \u0027I voted for an opposition candidate but whoever is elected, nothing will change.

When Paul Beckermann arrives at the Bauhaus art school in 1922, he’s captivated not only by his teachers but his fellow students too, not least the enigmatic Charlotte. But while Paul is immersed in the seductions and rivalries among his new friends, the rise of the far right threatens the Bauhaus’s very existence. Interweaving the personal and the political, Wood creates an atmospheric backdrop through which to explore the impact of macro events on art, culture, friendship and personal freedoms.In this meticulously researched and absorbing biography, Haste reassesses the life of Alma Mahler: socialite, composer and muse. Through extensive reference to diaries, previously unpublished letters and interviews with Mahler’s granddaughter, Haste draws a portrait of a complex, ambitious, highly accomplished woman. Married three times – to composer Gustav Mahler, architect and founder of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius, and writer Franz Werfel – Mahler is depicted as a woman who not only facilitated the creative pursuits of her husbands and lovers, but was an intellectual and creative force in her own right.Mona will soon turn 60.

Bosses, he insists, must commit to fighting inequality and tackling the climate emergency.“We are about to commit the biggest intergenerational crime in the history of mankind. We need to bring us together not drive us apart,” said the 63-year-old Dutchman, who won plaudits for pushing the benefits of sustainable business long before it became fashionable.“If you don’t address inequality and climate change, to keep it simple, a lot more people are going to be dissatisfied, feel not included or left behind, and making these choices of rejection at the ballot box. The fact we are having these issues of populism and schisms in society is exactly because we are not addressing the underlying issue to evolve capitalism and make sure it works for everybody,” he said. He believes the starting point is “heroic chief executives willing to step up and move outside of the comfort zone and take personal risks. I tried to do the same with Unilever. It’s a matter of willpower.”Polman has backed his words with cash by investing in Imagine, a foundation to push the UN’s sustainable development goals. But he has several other projects on the go, including helping the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and François-Henri Pinault, the boss of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent owner Kering, to develop a fashion-industry deal to cut waste and carbon emissions that is set to be announced at the G7 meeting in Biarritz next month. Polman said the aim is to get a fifth of the industry on board. He his hoping that signatories including the Calvin Klein owner PVH, H\u0026ampM and Inditex, the owner of Zara, will inspire others.Polman is also backing an initiative that adopts similar tactics to advance disability rights, Valuable 500. The campaign, which is aiming to recruit 500 chief executives of major companies who commit to putting disability on their board agenda this year, has just won the backing of seven major financial institutions, including the Bank of England, HSBC and Lloyds. The banks join existing signatories, including Barclays, Accenture, Microsoft, Virgin Media and Sainsbury’s.“We are trying to create tipping points on a sectorial level. The premise is that chief executives in the private sector need to drive major change in the absence of politicians doing it right now. Not exclusively but actively helping de-risk the political process,” Polman said.The boss who has publicly backed the young people behind Extinction Rebellion and is a fan of the teenage activist Greta Thunberg, said businesses that do not embrace issues of ersity, sustainability and equal rights will also struggle to attract talented young workers.“Millennials want to work for companies that stand for more than just making money.”Polman said he is no longer ridiculed for suggesting that tackling climate change makes business sense and that companies are also beginning to see that addressing equal rights is just as important.“We are now at a point in society where the cost of not acting in these areas is higher than acting. It is becoming mainstream. It comes down to humans, that’s the missing element,” Polman said.Caroline Casey, the founder of the Valuable 500 campaign, hopes that persuading key business leaders, such as Richard Branson, who has dyslexia, to be more open about their own disabilities and take action to make their companies more inclusive will demonstrate change is “good for business, good for people with disability and good for society in general”.She points out that there are about 13m people with disabilities in the UK who, together with their families, have a spending power of £249bn. However, businesses pay them far less attention than vegans, for example, who number less than one million.People with disabilities are also valuable employees who may be concealing non-obvious conditions such as autism, mental health problems or even blindness in the workplace.“There’s a cost to exclusion because we’re not releasing potential,” Casey said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f411eaca1d919173f7e6a087662ec37baae2b952/94_0_1695_1017/master/1695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd9996c1f0184d31812112ce09cbba0f","title":"panama deregisters tanker that strayed into iranian waters","story":"Country says MT Riah, which stopped transmitting location on 14 July, ‘deliberately violated international regulations’ Panama’s maritime authority has begun the process of withdrawing the registration of the oil tanker MT Riah, which ended up in Iranian waters after it disappeared from ship tracking maps in the strait of Hormuz on 14 July.Panama began the flag-withdrawal process on Friday after an investigation determined the tanker had “deliberately violated international regulations” by not reporting any unusual situation, the authority said in a statement.“We roundly condemn the use of Panamanian flagged ships for illicit activities,” it said.Panama, which has the largest shipping fleet in the world, has recently withdrawn flags from dozens of vessels, some of which were operated by Iran. It is not clear which country or company owns and operates the Riah.The latest development followed the British seizure of an Iranian oil tanker, Grace 1, which London suspected was violating EU sanctions on Syria.Sanctions against the regime of Bashir al Assad regime were there to be enforced and international law upheld, the UK argued. There seemed little doubt, given its circuitous route, that the ship was bound for Syria.Panama said the Grace 1 was removed from its registry on 29 May.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, branded the ship’s seizure as “piracy,” and Iran threatened to retaliate.On Friday it seized two British-linked ships in the strait of Hormuz. Iranian forces took control of the British-flagged Stena Impero, and directed it to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas, where it remains. A second Liberian-flagged but British operated tanker, the Mesdar, was also detained for several hours by Iranian forces on Friday. It made a sudden ersion from its planned course, and began moving towards the Iranian coast before apparently turning off its tracking signal.On Tuesday Iran’s semi-official news agency, ISNA, said the country’s navy came to the assistance of the MT Riah after it experienced mechanical problems. US officials have said they are unsure whether the tanker was seized by Iran or rescued, creating a mystery at sea at a time of high tension in the Gulf.The tracking report of the Riah from MarineTraffic showed the vessel began its journey near a port off the coast of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, on 5 July. It was then tracked near the coast of Ras al-Khaimah before changing course and travelling north towards Iranian waters, after which it stopped transmitting its signal on Sunday at about 4.30am local time (0100 BST).Its last known location was in Iranian territorial waters near Qeshm Island, where the Revolutionary Guards have a base.Earlier this month, Panama’s maritime authority said it would withdraw its flag from more vessels that violate sanctions and international legislation, following the removal of about 60 ships linked to Iran and Syria from the Panamanian registry in recent months.Washington has called for greater security for ships in the Gulf."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a617f528ce948729e6307dc727f9834eba9e3dda/24_159_4716_2829/master/4716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea53b95c6c6d52bf4c9ca7ab1e78ffaa","title":"regional policy requires rethink as myth of london productivity debunked","story":"Does a doctor in England’s capital really work three times harder than one in Merthyr Tydfil?Britain’s regional ide is well known and well documented. The richer bits of the country tend to be clustered below a line drawn from the Wash to the Severn estuary, while London is so different from everywhere else that it may as well be its own city-state.There is also another ide: between the big cities and the smaller towns. The north-west may be less prosperous than the south-east but on average people are better off in Manchester than they are in Blackpool.Economists have a posh way of describing the reason for this big-small disparity: agglomeration effects. This means that firms are more efficient if they are clustered together, with cities better locations for businesses than towns.Regional policy, to the limited extent that it currently exists, has involved encouraging regional hubs in the hope that they will pull up the struggling towns on their peripheries. Current thinking is that there is not a lot of point trying to encourage firms to relocate to places such as Blackpool because they are less efficient than the big conurbations.This notion, according to a new piece of research from Steve Fothergill and Tina Beatty of Sheffield Hallam University, is actually completely wrong. Once the official data for regional economic performance is broken down there is virtually no difference in economic efficiency between workers in one region and another, and workers in cities are no more efficient than workers in towns.This is not the picture provided by the official method of calculating productivity – gross value added. GVA per capita is the result of taking the value of the output of a country, region, city or town, subtracting the cost of the inputs that went producing it and then iding by the number of people.There are vast differences between the various parts of the UK on this measure. Against a nationwide average of 100, London has a GVA per capita of 179, almost three times as high as southern Scotland (61), west Wales and the valleys (63), and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly (65).Intuitively, such wide disparities seem a bit weird. In any one part of the country, the range of jobs is generally pretty uniform. London has hairdressers and so does southern Scotland. There are supermarkets, hospitals and schools in the Welsh valleys just as there in the capital. There is a demand for solicitors in Bodmin just as there is in Barking.Is it really possible that a doctor in London is three times as productive as a doctor in Merthyr Tydfil or that it takes three times as long for the Cornish lawyer to do the conveyancing on a house as it does for the one in Camden? Fothergill and Beatty’s research suggests there really is no real gap to speak of.They come to this conclusion by gradually stripping away various elements of GVA per capita. An adjustment is made to ide GVA by the number of people of working age (16-64) rather than the population as a whole. Account is taken of the fact that employment rates among the working-age population are higher in some parts of the country than others because of the number of students or those on disability benefits.Commuting makes a difference because the number of jobs in each area is not necessarily the same as the number of residents in work. The mix of industries also matters: some parts of the country have a high concentration of high productivity jobs – such as banking, finance and business services.The split of head office and routine jobs within industries is not even: some regions tend to have a bigger share of white-collar and executive roles. GVA comparisons are also skewed by the number of hours worked in different parts of the country.Even that, the authors say, is probably an overestimate because of the difficulties of properly accounting for the concentration of the most senior and highest-paid jobs in London.This study should be read in the highest levels of government. While it does not dispute that some parts of the country are richer than others, it does challenge agglomeration theory and the notion that a more active regional policy would require sacrificing efficiency for equity.Encouraging businesses to set up in the Welsh valleys would not mean that the UK as a whole would suffer. On the contrary, if underutilised resources could be brought into use through investment in infrastructure, research and development and skills, the economy would benefit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4844ef9c33fb0a90c9279d6af4c34a877f6351/741_828_4897_2939/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f151201598cf33bd1406845c2ef666be","title":"tell us about your favourite canal boat shop","story":"There are more licensed boats using Britain’s canals than at the height of the industrial revolution – and barge-based businesses are booming too.

How long until another road claims the title?The world has a new steepest street! But it’s more than 1,000 years old. So, did something happen to the previous steepest street? Is this an off-colour attempt to look on the bright side of a horrendous natural disaster? No, the previous steepest street is still there.So, has the old one somehow got less steep, perhaps because of a horrendous natural disaster? No, it’s as steep as ever. There is no horrendous natural disaster involved with this story. So what’s happened?Well, a street has been discovered that’s steeper than the street that, for some years, has been proclaiming itself to be the world’s steepest street. But how can a street be discovered? Was it buried? Is it part of a newly unearthed hilly suburb of Pompeii? No, stop trying to link it to horrendous natural disasters.The new steepest street has been in continuous occupation since time immemorial. Much longer, in fact, than its predecessor as holder of the accolade. So, the fact is – and I hate to be rude about what we now know is, at best, the second steepest street in the world – that this predecessor was an impostor, a usurper, albeit an unknowing one. It was never steepest. Even on the day of its construction, a steeper street already existed.Fundamentally, this is a damning indictment of the system by which the title of world’s steepest street is awarded, a process that, slightly suspiciously, appears to have something to do with Guinness. Common sense suggests that Guinness is not a substance likely to be of help in the global ranking of gradients in built-up areas.I should clarify that there is no suggestion that the whole steepest street issue got screwed up because everyone involved was off their face on Guinness, or even that their concentrations were marginally impaired by the responsible enjoyment of Guinness. They may not have drunk any Guinness at all. The link with Guinness is pretty tenuous. Guinness World Records, formerly the Guinness Book of Records, isn’t even owned by Diageo plc (which owns Guinness) any more.But the fact remains that it’s called Guinness World Records because of Guinness, the drink, not because of a random Andrew or Steve or Janet Guinness who loved measuring things and decided to put them all in a book. So there’s Guinness all over this mess and perhaps we all ought to think about that before we buy any more Guinness.Where the rigour lapsed, however, was in failing to check whether there were any other streets that were steeper. It’s a strange lapse, when you think about it. It seems so obvious: in order to know which is the world’s steepest street, you need to measure the steepness of every street in the world.Now, you may say that that is one hell of a logistical challenge. Who’s going to pay for that to be done? Not Diageo plc. And the wearying expense and difficulty is, to my mind, only compounded by the undeniable truth that finding out which of the world’s millions of streets happens to be steepest is a colossally unimportant task. I would have been content with a state of affairs where everyone agreed that Baldwin Street in Dunedin is certainly jolly steep, and probably a lot steeper than most streets, and we left it at that.The tallest bloke you’ve ever met is almost certainly not the tallest man on Earth. He might be, but you really have to check. You can’t just watch him fetch a football off a garage roof, say “Wow” and then stick it in your book – not if you think that being accurate about these records matters. Personally, I don’t think it matters, but I’d expect the people running Guinness World Records to think it does if they want to cling on to an iota of professional pride and aren’t just in it for all the free Guinness they probably no longer get.There are other people it seems to matter to as well because, bizarrely, being named the world’s steepest street actually generates a bit of tourism. Some people want to go and see the world’s steepest street. More people than want to avoid it. I don’t really understand why. Steep is a bad thing for a street to be. Streets are supposed to facilitate access to houses or shops. The steeper it is, the less well it does that. It would be like being the street with the worst maintained road surface in the world or being littered with the greatest density of impacted chewing gum.Nevertheless, there is genuinely a small amount of sadness in Dunedin that Baldwin Street has lost its status and a small amount of joy in Harlech in Wales that a very old street there, called Ffordd Pen Llech (which looks like more of a lane if you ask me), has been confirmed as always having been steeper.But how long can that joy last when the majority of the world’s street gradients remain unmeasured and unverified? What a precarious position: constantly worrying about losing the title if another street proves it’s in a more precarious position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3840e692ba31af31062a3dc98e0d959a9b4bddbf/0_3_5228_3136/master/5228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=465fdb7201213282816cc105e34c9f67","title":"iran gulf uk take the bait seizure british tanker","story":"It was like something out of a movie. To shouts of Allahu Akbar!, masked soldiers drop down ropes from a military helicopter on to a British oil tanker while Iranian navy speedboats surround the vessel. By radio, a voice warns the ship’s captain in English: “If you obey you will be safe”. There is no doubt that the Friday seizure by Iranian Revolutionary Guards of a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, was in part a piece of theatre intended to appease domestic clamour for Tehran to assert itself. It came in response to the UK military’s 4 July detention of an Iranian tanker, the Grace 1, in Gibraltar, allegedly for shipping oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. But the tit-for-tat response should also be evaluated as part of the Iranian attempt to push back against Donald Trump’s unilateral abandonment of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and his reimposition of economic sanctions.It is not clear if this strategy will do much to convince an exasperated Iranian public suffering under sanctions. It is also fraught with risks of escalation, threatening to further complicate UK-Iran bilateral relations and endanger wider European efforts to save the JCPOA, the international deal that committed Iran to strict curbs on its nuclear programme, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The risks are, at the moment, seen by Tehran as a necessary gamble to improve its international leverage if dipomatic negotiations resume. Two weeks of fruitless mediation efforts to release the Grace 1 prompted Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei to state: “The Islamic Republic and its committed forces will not leave this evil without a response.” It seems the Stena Impero is a pawn in a bigger game.Iran blames the Trump administration for influencing and coordinating the seizure of its tanker. Iran has a point: this crisis is inextricably linked to the wider effort by US hardliners to pressure Iran. Having unilaterally withdrawn from the JCPOA and reimposed sanctions, Washington’s actions have undoubtedly lead to the escalatory ripple effects now playing out in the Strait of Hormuz.Over the past year the countries known as the E3 – France, Germany and the UK – have tried in vain to save the JCPOA. Faced with the loss of the promised material benefits of signing up to the deal, Iran has begun to marginally breach its nuclear commitments by increasing its levels of enriched uranium.Under siege from US sanctions and receiving limited tangible benefits from Europe, Tehran has chosen to up the ante and make the international community feel some of its pain. The Stena Impero is a bargaining chip for the release of the Grace 1. Other Iranian provocations – deliberate breaches of the JCPOA, the downing of a US drone, attacks on other tankers in the Gulf and the arrests of dual nationals – should be seen in the same context.Iranian policymakers are also taking a leaf from the perceived success of a 2005 confrontation that resulted in the acceleration of Iran’s nuclear programme, believed to have produced greater international concessions. Caught between US bullying and the frustration of Iranian nuclear transgressions, Europe has tried to pursue an independent approach. But if Iran continues to escalate it could provoke a greater European-US alignment than would be useful for itself. Indeed, the E3 have jointly condemned Iran’s actions and have called for the quick release of the ship.While Jeremy Hunt has warned Iran of “serious consequences”, it is important for the British response to be calibrated. Above all, the UK should avoid the temptation to align completely with Washington on Iran. Talk of sanctions and asset freezes will only put the nuclear deal and European efforts at further risk.Rather than conflating the ships and the nuclear crisis, a direct UK-Iran bilateral negotiation on the tankers could provide both sides with a face-saving outcome. It could in turn allow the new British prime minister to take a bigger role in JCPOA mediation efforts. The UK could position itself as a bridge between the EU and US, and in the process boost its post-Brexit relevance.• Sanam Vakil is a senior research fellow in the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/544d2253e75e2caadecf7d3f54b75bb6b0567ea3/0_164_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d43e69298cf359615e5453e8195d17ee","title":"mps stop no deal brexit british public economic shock","story":"They are right to be worried: the no-deal Brexit we are now being offered is not the Brexit promised before and during the referendum. “What most people in this country want is the single market, the common market”, Boris Johnson is on record as saying, along with “Personally, I would like to stay in the single market”. “Wouldn’t it be terrible if we were really like Norway and Switzerland? Really?” said Nigel Farage. “They’re rich. They’re happy. They’re self-governing.”Indeed, as revealed in a little-known table in a Treasury study last November, a no-deal Brexit could cost the country nearly £100bn in lost revenues and higher social security costs, far beyond the £26bn of “headroom money” that Tory leadership candidates have handed out over and over again to fund their various notions. When future historians look back, they will be shocked to discover how such an act of economic self-harm that runs wholly counter to the national interest could ever be portrayed by Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson as the height of patriotism, and criticism from any quarter dismissed as a betrayal.Even if some of the immediate chaos forecast by officials is averted on the day, the long-term economic impact of no deal is where the calamity lies. British history includes self-inflicted wounds – military disasters such as the Charge of the Light Brigade and the fiasco of Gallipoli – but no peacetime act of self-harm can rival exiting the EU without a deal when we are so woefully unprepared. Even now the new European commission president is offering to deliver us from this fate – and we are refusing the help. But for the Brexiteers there is little consideration of the consequences of what they propose. Their mission is driven by belief, emotion and ideology and the vehemence with which allegations of “betrayal” and “treachery” are thrown around reveals a profound crisis of identity.For what message do we send about what kind of Britain we now are if we reject out of hand last week’s European offer to ditch the cliff-edge, and boast instead that we will not pay the money we owe to the EU: the equivalent of declaring an economic war on our neighbours? Brexiteers may be trying to reinvent a “Britain alone” Dunkirk spirit – once again showing its indomitable fortitude. But this all too easily descends into an inward-looking, intolerant and adversarial brand of paranoid nationalism bent on blaming all who disagree. MPs can and should still prevent no deal. Parliament last week voted against its own prorogation, and Boris Johnson is now more likely to call a final Commons vote between his no deal and staying in the EU. Brexiteers who have campaigned for decades to restore parliamentary sovereignty will argue that a sovereign people cannot be undermined by a now non-sovereign parliament.Having been an MP for half my life, I well understand the duty an MP has to listen to their constituents – the Brexit referendum reveals grievances that must be addressed – but also the obligation to weigh the balance of risks before a parliamentary vote as important as this.For each member will have to explain a no-deal Brexit to the mother in their constituency whose child is suffering or even dying because lifesaving drugs cannot get through, and to the small businessman or woman seeing a lifetime’s work ruined and the livelihoods of their workforce with it. MPs will still receive their salaries, and from its new office in Dublin, inside the EU, the City firm co-founded by Jacob Rees-Mogg will still make its millions. But the other 649 MPs must recognise the plight of the less well-protected, whose prospects this mindless course of action so needlessly destroys.• Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a06a1dfe07c9d5d083908159f3da9ad2922d79/2_0_2527_1516/master/2527.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=46bcf0418ee4b6e2b9b0e9c3d220ce92 1290w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of climb","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘climb’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘climb’.Share your photos of what climb means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 24 July at 10am.

Is it a film aimed specifically at younger viewers, tailor-made to cater to their growing needs? Maybe it’s a film about childhood, a coming-of-age story that resonates with a wide range of viewers, young and old alike. Or perhaps it’s simply any film that a child could watch, anything that isn’t restricted by its nature to adult-only audiences.When I was a kid in the late 60s and early 70s, there were two movie classifications that excluded younger viewers: the AA category, introduced in 1970, for which you had to be at least 14 years old and X-certificate movies, which were restricted to over-16s or (after 1970) over-18s. Films that fell under these prohibitive categories included everything from the David EssexRingo Starr Brit-pop romp That’ll Be the Day to the violent Sam Peckinpah shocker Straw Dogs via such innocuous fare as Blazing Saddles, American Graffiti and Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. All of these were out of bounds in my preteen years. Yet there were plenty more strange and wonderful films that fell into the U or A certificate categories, making them available to anyone (or at least anyone over the age of five), sometimes under adult supervision, more often not…From as far back as I can remember, I spent as much time in the cinema as possible, seeing anything and everything that I was allowed to watch – with occasionally traumatic results. I remember one Saturday morning in 1970, when I was eight years old. My mother dropped my brother and me at the local Odeon while she went and did the weekly shopping. She knew the film showing that morning would be suitable for us because it had a U certificate, meaning “universal” – fit for all!Two hours later, she picked us up outside the cinema in floods of tears. The film we’d been watching was Ken Loach’s Kes – a milestone of British cinema that didn’t shy away from depicting the grim realities of its central character’s hard-knocks life, including beatings, taunting, naked humiliation, and (in the final reel) horrible animal death.Despite my distress, I have never once regretted seeing Kes at such a young age (it has since been reclassified PG, meaning that parents should take care). Other movies that I saw around the same age included Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, Andrei Tarkovsky’s Solaris, Arthur Hiller’s Plaza Suite, Jean-Luc Godard’s Alphaville, Franklin J Schaffner’s Patton (Elvis’s favourite film!), Jess Franco’s The Castle of Fu Manchu and a string of catastrophe-filled 70s disaster movies from Airport to The Towering Inferno. None of these would generally be considered “children’s movies”, but I saw them all as a child, and they were all part of my cinematic education, for better or worse.In compiling this list of 25 great movies for children, I have attempted to bear in mind the vast range of films that I was lucky enough to have encountered at an impressionable age, and to acknowledge that, until fairly recently, young moviegoers were raised on a diet of movies that played to audiences of all ages. To this end, I’ve used the current guidelines of the British Board of Film Classification (still the most reliable and accountable regulatory body in the world) as a yardstick, accepting for inclusion any film that they currently rate U, PG or 1212A – the classifications of movies which can legitimately be watched by audiences under the age of 15.My choices range from short animations to feature-length live-action films, from silent films to foreign-language classics (I’m assuming subtitles aren’t an issue) from a century of international cinema. Along with the more obvious contenders, I’ve included a few titles that some readers may not consider to be children’s films at all. Fair enough. But, crucially, these are all films that kids could watch, if they wanted. The list is arranged not by merit but by date, and I’ve included the most recent BBFC certificates for reference. Take a look, and then let me know your own choices.• Tell us about your favourite children’s films in the comments below or tweet us at @ObsNewReview• Unless otherwise indicated, the films listed can be found to rent or buy on one or more of the usual online streaming servicesJackie Coogan stars as Charlie Chaplin’s sidekickadopted waif in this timeless classic, widely regarded as one of the finest films of the silent era. In his first feature-length feature as director, Chaplin conjures “a picture with a smile – and perhaps a tear”, perfecting the blend of humour, pathos and tragedy that would make him a beloved icon around the world. No child or adult could watch this and remain unmoved.Lotte Reiniger’s 1926 German production is one of the oldest surviving animated features, and suffers from the kind of racial and gender stereotyping that beset so many films of this period. But for audiences mature enough to see beyond the outmoded politics, it offers a fascinating insight into the history of animation. Taking inspiration from One Thousand and One Nights, Reiniger’s film has influenced countless children’s classics, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Sword in the Stone and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.Disney’s first feature-length animation played to packed houses of all ages when first released. An astonishing technical achievement, it benefited from eye-popping artwork, spine-tingling music, and an occasionally horrifying narrative (the BBFC originally rated it A, and it only got an uncut U in 1987). This note of brooding darkness would continue throughout all the finest Disney films, connecting them to the great traditions of the Brothers Grimm, and proving that children appreciate a touch of fear with their fun.Flying monkeys, terrifying twisters and melting witches – they’re all here in MGM’s brilliant adaptation of L Frank Baum’s fantastical source material. Shirley Temple was originally considered for the lead role of Dorothy, a part Judy Garland made her own. Despite winning an Oscar for best song, Arlen and Harburg’s Over the Rainbow nearly hit the cutting room floor after studio execs worried that the sepia-toned Kansas scenes were too long, and younger kids wouldn’t understand the complex emotions of the lyrics.Satyajit Ray’s directorial debut won the best human document award at the 1956 Cannes film festival, and became a key text in the evolution of modern Indian cinema. Adapted from the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, Ray’s film portrays the struggles and smiles of impoverished village life with clarity and compassion, aided by a wonderfully natural performance from young Subir Banerjee. The film was followed by Aparajito and Apur Sansar, which together form the acclaimed Apu trilogy.Albert Lamorisse’s short French film follows the adventures of a young boy who finds a balloon that seems to have a mind of its own. A beacon of hope amid a darkened landscape, it’s an endlessly intriguing and inspiring slice of poetic postwar cinema. Lamorisse won an Oscar for best screenplay, becoming the only person ever to triumph in this category with a short film.Jean-Pierre Léaud is the restless spirit who comes of age in François Truffaut’s nouvelle vague masterpiece. The French title, Les Quatre Cents Coups, refers to an expression meaning “to raise hell”, capturing the rebellious nature of Antoine Doinel, an alter ego character drawn in part from Truffaut’s own youthful experiences. Léaud would play Antoine in a succession of subsequent movies ning two decades.Barry Hines’s novel A Kestrel for a Knave is brought to the screen with astonishing verisimilitude by Ken Loach in this masterpiece of British social-realist cinema. David “Dai” Bradley is the young Billy Caspar whose dreams take flight when he trains and tends to a bird that becomes his closest companion. Despite an unforgivingly downbeat ending, Kes remains essential viewing for anyone who believes in the transcendent power of honest art.Originally released in France as Pollux et le Chat Bleu, this feature-length spinoff from The Magic Roundabout arrived in the UK with the voices of Eric Thompson and Fenella Fielding. Together they transform Serge Danot’s peculiar stop-motion animation into a brilliantly bizarre and eerily haunting oddity that continues to attract new generations of fans. No wonder Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker chose Florence’s Sad Song (a track from the movie) as one of his selections on Desert Island Discs.Only on DVD (Second Sight Films)Writer-director Lionel Jeffries works pure screen wonder with Antonia Barber’s novel The Ghosts. When a family become housekeepers of a derelict mansion, time-travelling magic forges friendships across the ages. While Jeffries may be more celebrated for directing The Railway Children (one of the most enduring British children’s movies), this is his true masterpiece.Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, Caroline Leaf’s Oscar-nominated short – a mere 10 minutes in length – uses paint on glass animation to bring Mordecai Richler’s story (which addresses the taboo subject of death) to life with empathy and wit. In a 2003 interview, Leaf said that the key to her adaptation was “to drop as much of the text as possible, putting the storytelling into the images”.Free at nfb.cafilmthe_streetThis tearjerking tale of a young boy’s friendship with a stranded space alien may technically be a sci-fi movie, but it also represents a very personal account of director Steven Spielberg’s down-to-earth feelings of childhood isolation and anxiety following his parents’ orce. A wonderful script by Melissa Mathison and a surging score by John Williams help this to pack a mighty emotional punch.It’s hard to decide which of Hayao Miyazaki’s matchless animations to include in this list (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle and Ponyo are all classics) but this 1988 Studio Ghibli offering about young children befriending forest spirits retains a special place in many viewers’ hearts. As with all of the Ghibli films, My Neighbour Totoro boasts the pan-generational appeal that has made Miyazaki’s works so popular.Only on DVD (StudioCanal)Frances Hodgson Burnett’s book has inspired several movies, from a 1919 production starring Lila Lee to a forthcoming version written by Harry Potter and the Cursed Child playwright Jack Thorne. But Agnieszka Holland’s 1993 adaptation, which earned a supporting actress Bafta nomination for Maggie Smith, is a particular delight, hailed by Roger Ebert as “a work of beauty, poetry and deep mystery… like entering for a time into a closed world where one’s destiny may be discovered”.Gillian Armstrong’s hugely likable adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s novel about the lives of the four March sisters earned Oscar nominations for Thomas Newman’s score, Colleen Atwood’s costumes, and Winona Ryder’s starring role as Jo March. First brought to the screen in the silent era, the novel has inspired films by such luminaries as George Cukor and Mervyn LeRoy, with a new version written and directed by Greta Gerwig due to open in the UK in the new year.Youssou N’Dour provides the music for Michel Ocelot’s international co-production, an animated fable, inspired by a west African folk tale, about a young boy who takes on a sorceress terrorising his village. The BBFC, who rated the film U, note correctly that it contains “mild violence, peril and natural nudity” – the last of which reportedly caused problems in some territories.Only on DVD (BFI)Keisha Castle-Hughes shines in Niki Caro’s breakout New Zealand hit, based on the novel of the same name by Māori writer Witi Ihimaera. A young girl fights for the right to become the leader of her tribe – a role traditionally reserved for men. Castle-Hughes earned a best actress Oscar nomination, making her at the time the youngest ever nominee in that category (a record later broken by Quvenzhané Wallis for her performance in Beasts of the Southern Wild).It’s arguable that Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, Gurinder Chadha’s 2008 adaptation of Louise Rennison’s teen novels, better suits the “children’s film” remit of this list. But her 2002 classic about the friendship between two young women (winningly played by Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley) who bond on the football pitch seems even more pertinent today than it did when the film first came out. A hit with audiences and critics alike, Bend It Like Beckham spawned a stage musical and continues to inspire new viewers.Byambasuren Davaa, co-director of The Story of the Weeping Camel, returns to her Mongolian homeland for this blend of fact and fiction, centring on a family of hard-working nomads whose work-life cycles are defined by the rhythm of the seasons. Whether making cheese, dismantling their yurt or playing with dried dung (a highlight for the kids!) the Batchuluuns remind us that, trite as it may sound, life’s true joys lie in the simple things. A lovely movie with the power to engross, educate and entertain.Originally entitled Taare Zameen Par, this hugely popular Indian drama, produced and directed by Aamir Khan, follows young Ishaan (Darsheel Safary) as he faces up to educational challenges. India’s submission for the 2009 foreign language film Oscar, Like Stars on Earth was picked up by Disney on DVD, bringing it to the attention of a worldwide audience. Waad Mohammed is terrific as the titular Saudi girl who enters a Koran recitation competition in the hope of raising the funds she needs to buy herself a coveted bicycle. Written and directed by Saudi Arabian film-maker Haifaa al-Mansour, this Bafta-nominated treat is a little miracle – a film that challenges rules and stereotypes with a lightness of touch that makes it accessible to all.Inspired by the true-life story of Phiona Mutesi, this uplifting film follows a young woman living in the slums of Uganda whose life is changed by her talent for chess. Madina Nalwanga, David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong’o head up a very engaging ensemble cast with whom director Mira Nair works wonders (fun fact: Moonlight helmer Barry Jenkins was at one point in the running to direct).UK-based Dutch animator Michaël Dudok de Wit directs this Japanese-French-Belgian co-production – a first for Studio Ghibli. A poignant, wordless tale of a man shipwrecked on a desert island, it boasts a sublime simplicity that unifies its complex elements into a singular, universal voice. Eloquent, profound and moving, The Red Turtle benefits from a wonderful score by Laurent Perez del Mar that says more than words ever could.Adapted from Deborah Ellis’s much-loved YA book, Nora Twomey’s beautifully animated tale of youthful fortitude in Taliban-era Afghanistan has something of the defiant feminist spirit of the French-Iranian gem Persepolis. When her father is imprisoned, young Parvana is forced to don’s men’s clothes in order to provide for her family.

This is the effect known as jet lag. Symptoms include tiredness, headaches, nausea and diarrhoea.It takes our bodies one day to adjust to a time difference of one hour, so Gardiner recommends pre-emptively adjusting our clocks at home: one hour a day towards the time zone to which you are travelling, no more than three days before travelling. “If the duration of travel is less than the number of time zones you travel across, you need to plan – getting your body used to the new time zone will help you adjust much faster.”“Diet plays a large part in setting the body clock,” says Lisa Artis, an adviser at the Sleep Council, which promotes healthy sleep habits. “Once you are on the plane, set your watch to the local time at your destination, then eat according to normal meal times at your destination.” Heavy meals increase our sleep drive, so a balanced diet helps kickstart our body clock into its destination timings.Be sure to drink plenty of water. Gardiner says that our body clocks can be set off-kilter by dehydration. “People don’t drink enough water on planes and often replace it with alcohol, which is a depressant and dehydrating, or they drink too much caffeine, which keeps you awake,” she says. “Your body needs to re-adjust naturally to its new time zone and it’s not advisable to manipulate it.”Dr Guy Meadows, a co-founder of the insomnia treatment service Sleep School, recommends getting 20 to 30 minutes of natural light exposure the morning after arriving at your destination. “Our body clocks are connected to light-receptive cells in our eyes, so making sure to darken down throughout the day is a very powerful way of synchronising with your new environment,” he says.If you are adamant about avoiding jet lag, travelling west – and therefore lengthening your day by going backwards through time zones – will alleviate the symptoms. Timings your flights is also important – Meadows says that we need at least 10 hours of wakefulness to induce a restful sleep. Factoring this into your flight time, and arriving after sunset, will help adjust your schedule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e50977069728d6155d217c88e141aa2501ce0/0_18_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1052292384ee91932455652a219d97","title":"has brexit saved the lib dems","story":"The Lib Dems have made an extraordinary comeback in 2019 because of their anti-Brexit stance.

Foreign Office veterans, however, defended the ambassador’s cables as nothing more than the type of frank talk expected of diplomats.Scotland Yard has launched an investigation into the leak to the Mail on Sunday and at one stage suggested editors could be prosecuted for publishing sensitive material.In his account of the affair, Edginton admitted to believing he could be arrested for his role even though he was not “the leaker”. He said he had begun investigating this year how the civil service was preparing for Brexit.“There had been repeated reports claiming that Europhile mandarins have been quietly working to thwart the result of the referendum,” he wrote. “I just wanted to discover the truth. This was not a Brexiteer plot to topple Sir Kim, nor was it some devilish scheme to torpedo the independence of the civil service by installing a political appointee in Washington. Instead, it was simply an honest journalistic endeavour.”Edginton, who has vowed to protect the identity of his “trusted source”, said he spoke to serving and former civil servants to find out about their role during preparations for Brexit. He said he was passed a letter written by Darroch describing the White House as “inept”. He realised it was a significant story and contacted Isabel Oakeshott, the journalist under whose byline the Darroch story first appeared in the Mail on Sunday.Edginton said: “I appreciate that my CV – and my pro-Brexit views – will inevitably fuel the conspiracy theories but I want to be absolutely clear: the leak of Sir Kim’s cables had absolutely nothing to do with the Brexit party.”Edginton worked initially for the political website Westmonster, founded by the Brexit-backer Arron Banks, before periods as a digital strategist at the Taxpayers’ Alliance and Leave Means Leave campaign. Since April he has been employed by the Brexit party, organising its social media feeds.In his Mail on Sunday article, Edginton said his name was left out of the original story to avoid “possible controversy”.It was a big scoop for a young journalist with no formal training. Although it is not unusual for British tabloids to use the work of journalists without giving them a credit, it is unusual for the freelancer to out themselves at a later date. Edginton said he had already provided stories on this basis to the Sunday Times, the Daily , the Sun’s website and the Mail on Sunday.Edginton previously described Oakeshott as “one of the best journalists this country has to offer” after she ran a story in the Sunday Times about Banks’s links to the Russian embassy.“I first contacted Isabel three years ago, when I was 16 and still at state school, asking if I could interview her for my YouTube channel,” he wrote this year, explaining that he had since accompanied her to many public appearances.In another tweet, recently deleted, he described helping Oakeshott to prepare for a Question Time appearance in December 2017.Having started an obscure politics YouTube channel while still a teenager, Edginton interviewed a number of prominent political figures and began adopting an increasingly pro-Brexit stance, which opened a number of doors.Last summer, he turned down the offer of a place at the London School of Economics to continue working for Westmonster, the hyper-partisan online news outlet founded by Banks and formeMichael Heaver, a former spokesman for Nigel Farage and now a Brexit party MEP.He then picked up a number of roles in quick succession, including a stint as digital campaign manager at the Taxpayers’ Alliance, and this year began work doing digital strategy work for Leave Means Leave. The pro-Brexit organisation was founded by the businessman Richard Tice.After Tice co-founded the Brexit party with Farage to fight the EU elections, Edginton joined as head of digital campaigns, where he was one of the few iniduals with access to the party’s Facebook page during the EU elections – helping to oversee a series of slick videos.

And despite rumours of Brussels compromises in the works, the EU has no off-the-shelf Brexit plan for the new prime minister, who is expected to be announced on Tuesday.Danuta Hübner, a Polish centre-right member of the European parliament’s Brexit steering group, said there was a “worrying” lack of time to find a compromise before Britain’s departure day on 31 October.She could not imagine the EU putting anything new on the table, but said it remained open to renegotiating the political declaration on future relations. “We cannot change the major red lines on our side, that there is no possibility of renegotiating the agreement, including the backstop.”Johnson and Hunt have vowed to tear up the backstop, the fallback plan to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, which both men have voted for at least once. Recent reports have suggested the EU is ready to offer a five-year transition to break the deadlock over the backstop.But three EU sources said this was a rehash of debates from the negotiation period, rather than fresh ideas. “It’s all quite ancient” and “not something that we are considering at all”, an official said.Another favourite Tory idea, a time limit on the backstop, also appears to be based on bar-room conversations that took place more than a year ago rather than new proposals. Before the backstop was agreed, time limits were “mused over by iniduals, typically over a beer”, said the official. The idea was never seriously discussed in the EU27’s formal negotiations and disappeared after Theresa May “embraced the backstop”, the person said.In what is seen as a major concession to the government, the prime minister persuaded the EU to accept a UK-wide backstop, rather than the original Northern Ireland-only plan.EU officials are also disappointed that guarantees to avoid the backstop – seen in Brussels as generous and far-reaching – did not help persuade MPs to support the withdrawal agreement, which was rejected three times.Between December 2018 and March 2019, the EU issued three sets of promises outlining speedy work on a future trade deal to avoid the backstop. Each text became more elaborate, culminating in the Strasbourg agreement, with its pledge of joint work on “alternative arrangements” to avoid a backstop – a key phrase for Tory backbenchers.But the Strasbourg agreement failed to move Eurosceptics who feared being “trapped” in a permanent customs union with the EU, after the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, confirmed it provided no unilateral exit from the backstop.Officials believe they could work on similar guarantees, but are not convinced this will help Johnson win a majority. “People say that he is better at selling things than Madame May,” said the senior source. “It’s not a huge hope.”As Brussels waits for Johnson, the commission’s Brexit negotiating taskforce will be on standby over the summer.Meanwhile, the EU is trying to figure out whether Johnson is serious about his “do or die” rhetoric, or will attempt the political backflip of selling a rebranded version of May’s deal. “The next British prime minister has to choose whether they want to ruin their career on Brexit or move on,” an EU diplomat said.Some are still trying to figure our his true views on the EU. Hübner recalls a “wonderful conversation” with Johnson when, as European regional policy commissioner, she visited the then London mayor in 2008, to announce EU funds for East End startups. “He was also very positive about EU transfers to London to support a project. Now when I hear very nasty comments about the European Union, I am thinking: is this the same person?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b93f66b20f1b62a21c89ede50492941545cb250/0_123_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbe5a1bd06f183660757359966f40e1a","title":"uk defence minister tobias ellwood rebuffs criticism over tanker seized in gulf iran","story":"Tobias Ellwood denies Britain took ‘eye off the ball’ and says priority is to reduce tensionsThe defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, has rejected the charge that a British-flagged tanker seized by Iran in the Gulf could have been better protected, and said the priority for the UK must be to de-escalate tensions.Ellwood also called for more spending on the Royal Navy, and said the US’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal had played a part in the increasing tensions in the region.Among critics of UK government actions ahead of the seizure of the Stena Impero in what the British says were international waters has been Admiral Lord West, the former first sea lord.Writing in the Observer, West said ministers should have done more, suggesting those responsible for such decisions were distracted by the race to succeed Theresa May.But asked on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme whether the UK had taken its “eye off the ball”, Ellwood replied: “No, not at all.”While the UK was sending another destroyer and a support ship to the region, he said, British vessels were going through 100 nautical miles of waterway every day. “It is impossible simply to escort each inidual vessel,” he said.Ellwood added that the situation had also changed quickly. “Let’s place it into context – this has been a sudden spike in activity, in threat, that’s ratcheted up in the last few weeks. And it takes time to respond there.”Asked what the response should be, he said: “Firstly we need to try and de-escalate this. We’ve seen a ratcheting up of tensions in the Middle East.”The situation with the tanker was, he argued, “part of a wider geo-political challenge that Iran is facing with the west”.Ellwood said: “So our first and most important responsibility is to make sure we get a solution to the issue to do with the current ship, make sure that other British-flagged ships are safe to operate in these waters, and then look at the wider picture of having a working, proper, professional relationship with Iran.“But this is a hostile act, let’s not dodge away from that. This is a serious matter which Iran must recognise.”Asked if sanctions were possible, Ellwood said the government’s Cobra emergencies committee met on Saturday, “so we’re looking at the operational responsibilities from that but, yes, we are going to be looking at a series of options”.He called for more money to be invested in defence. “If we want to continue playing a role on the international stage – bearing in mind that threats are changing, all happening just beneath the threshold of all-out war – then we must invest more in our defence, including our Royal Navy.“Our Royal Navy is too small to manage our interests across the globe, if that’s our future intentions, and that’s something the next prime minister will need to recognise.”Asked if the US’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal played a role, Ellwood said: “There is a concern that we have a difference of opinion with the United States on the nuclear itself. France, Germany and ourselves believe that it has paid idends, has actually prevented nuclear weapons being developed in Iran.“We can’t deny that this tactical threat, and escalation of issues in the Strait of Hormuz, factors into this bigger picture.”Speaking later on the Sophy Ridge show, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, said it was important to avoid the UK being sucked into a wider US-led conflict, and to prevent a repeat of the “great tragedy of Iraq”.Burgon said: “What we want to ensure doesn’t happen is that the mistakes of the past are repeated. The mistakes of the past cost many, many lives. The mistakes of the past made things worse, and fuelled terrorism and hatred. And that’s what we don’t want. We don’t want to be a situation where things get out of control.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e082b2aa6f8fbbc5ba05467c26a5558e0138e45/0_58_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebec22de3d87bd41758a13cbfbecdbdf","title":"senior doctors call for crackdown on home genetic testing kits","story":"False results have told women they have mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer Senior doctors have called for a crackdown on consumer genetic tests, following an influx of patients who have been wrongly told they are carrying dangerous mutations linked to cancer or other devastating conditions.Women have been incorrectly informed by companies that they have faulty BRCA genes, which convey a high risk of breast and ovarian cancers. One patient was scheduled for preventive breast-removal surgery after a consumer genetic test suggested she had a BRCA mutation. The surgery was called off at the last moment when an NHS laboratory revealed the result to be a false positive.Doctors warn that the issue is placing an increasing burden on GP surgeries and NHS genetics clinics, which are left to deal with the fallout when people receive alarming or confusing results.“I’m not saying ban these tests, but they need more regulating,” she said.A recent analysis of a genetic testing chip that has been used by direct-to-consumer companies, found that for typical disease-causing BRCA mutations, when the test gave a positive result it was far more likely than not to be wrong.Lucassen said she is personally aware of about 10 cases of patients being referred to genetics services after having tested positive for BRCA or bowel cancer mutations, which were later shown to be glitches when NHS labs conducted more rigorous tests. “I feel this is the tip of the iceberg,” she said.Consumer genetics tests, offering insights on health and ancestry, have had a surge in popularity in the past few years, with hundreds of thousands of people in the UK thought to have undergone testing. The major consumer genetics companies, such as 23andMe or AncestryDNA, typically offer just ancestry testing or health readouts restricted to a handful of conditions. However, consumers can download their raw genetic data and send it to third-party companies, which for as little as £20 provide results and analysis on thousands of genes.The problem is that the chip technology used by 23andMe and AncestryDNA is not designed to give accurate results for rare mutations, which secondary companies, such as Promethease and LiveWello, provide information about.Although these companies normally state that any findings should not be treated as a medical diagnosis, consumers – and even doctors – may be unaware of just how unreliable such results can be.Caroline Wright, a genomics researcher at Exeter University who led the analysis, said: “The findings are shockingly bad. At the point where they’re this bad, you have to think about not sharing the data. It can be so damaging to the inidual if they find out this completely erroneous information.”Wright said that the genotyping chips used by some companies might perform slightly better, but that the technology is fundamentally not designed to detect rare mutations.Lucassen described how one of her female patients had been scheduled for a double mastectomy on the basis of findings that were shown to be flawed when the genetic analysis was redone in NHS laboratories, which use more powerful genotyping techniques. When the repeat tests came back negative, Lucassen said the patient asked: “Can I have the surgery anyway just to be on the safe side?” Although she was ultimately dissuaded, “she wasn’t at all reassured by finding this was a false positive,” Lucassen said.Jan Cobben, a clinical genetics consultant at Northwick Park hospital in north-west London, said he had encountered two separate cases of parents who tested positive for mutations linked to deafness and thought the genes could be affecting their children. In one case, the family had a deaf child and thought they had found an explanation. A different set of parents had been dealing with the fairly common frustration that their child often seemed to ignore what they were saying, but the genetic result led them to fear that there could be a serious underlying medical condition.“They think: ‘Oh my God, it’s related,’” said Cobben. “There’s a gene for hearing where abnormalities are not very rare. We repeated the test and the supposed abnormality was just a normal variant.”Cobben said he would advise anyone considering private genetic screening: “Stay away, don’t do it.” “You shouldn’t do any medical testing without a reason,” he said. “It’s a basic medical principle.”In response to questions, Kwame Iwegbue, CEO of LiveWello, which carries out secondary analysis of DNA data, said the company does not alert customers to the risk of false positive or false negative results because these are “qualities of diagnostic tests”. “LiveWello does not provide any diagnostic testing,” he said.Iwegbue said it was “absolutely” reasonable for NHS clinics to cover the cost of interpreting and validating private genetic tests. “A direct consequence of access to third-party online tools like LiveWello and access to ubiquitous sources of online medical knowledge is that patients nowadays are empowered and informed,” he said. “At the very least the information they acquire from these sources provide talking points for a more rewarding doctor-patient encounter … If the information presented by the patient is in fact wrong, the doctor can use this opportunity to explain the reasons why, and then present the patient with what they consider to be the correct information.”Greg Lennon, a co-founder of Promethease, said: “When we can, we specifically warn our users of likely miscalls, and in addition, we remind people that reported associations depend on the accuracy of the data.”Lennon sent screenshots of example reports where a false positive is thought to be likely, which prominently alert the user to this possibility.A spokeswoman for 23andMe said: “There is a distinction between the validated variants we report on in our … reports and the raw, unvalidated data customers may choose to download on their own. We do not advise customers to utilise third-party interpretation services and note the risks of doing so very clearly on our website and within customers’ 23andMe accounts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6652b9a30a1d4624bc6a3313f1d7cff745f7d8de/0_361_5366_3221/master/5366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a692a9214a4e213d192b87ed1adc7f0c","title":"market harborough most liveable place in england  homes we can afford","story":"East Midlands town is unexpected winner in a search for the best places for affordability and quality of life. Its proud residents explain why they like it“We’ve still got a fishmonger. How many places still have that?” asked Kate Gander, listing the merits of her home, Market Harborough. In fact, she struggled to find anything negative at all to say about the Leicestershire town. “It’s got fantastic railway connections and it’s not too overrun by big businesses,” she said.Market Harborough today comes top in a league table of the most – and least – liveable places in England. Balancing the affordability of homes with factors that make a place desirable to live in, such as employment opportunities and the performance of local schools, Harborough, Hart in Hampshire, the Isles of Scilly and Chorley in Lancashire are at the top of the table. Hackney, in east London, Middlesbrough and Manchester languish at the bottom.Gander’s enthusiasm was echoed by stallholder Tina Horton. “I deliberately set up a business in Harborough. The market is just like a big family. All the little shops make it what it is.”House prices in the town are generally a little higher than the national average, but rents are a little lower – and above-average earnings of the town’s population (£33,700 compared with a national figure of £30,400) bolster its “affordability” score, one of the report’s key criteria. Nearly nine out of 10 locals are in work, and the area’s secondary schools score well. Residents can expect to live two years longer than most people in the UK.But it’s not just about statistics. Small independent retailers reign supreme in the quaint town centre, which is dominated by the medieval St Dionysius’ church and 17th-century timbered Old Grammar School, now a covered market and museum. Last week, colourful flower displays were standing up well to the pouring rain and there was a striking absence of empty shops.Next month, the town will host the Leicestershire County Show, featuring motorcycle stuntman Flyin’ Ryan, sheep shearing and donkey rides. The Harborough Theatre is screening the National Theatre’s production of Small Island, adapted from Andrea Levy’s novel, this weekend, and the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Measure for Measure at the end of the month. London is an hour away by train and there are direct services to Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield.“Market Harborough is a beautiful market town, the villages surrounding it are beautiful, and there is such a strong sense of community. We’re thrilled to be recognised in such a positive light,” said Neil O’Brien, the local Conservative MP.The report, written by a former Treasury economist, Chris Walker, for Your Housing Group, aims to “create a more real-world and accurate picture of what affordability is, and where exactly more affordable new-build housing is most urgently needed”.It has given every local authority in England a score based on three metrics – affordability, opportunity and desirability – based on factors such as jobs, income, educational attainment, burglary rates, the number of empty homes and life expectancy.London fares badly in the resulting “liveability index”, mainly because of its unaffordability and average quality of life. Four out of the country’s 10 least-liveable places are in the capital – Hackney, Newham, Barking and Dagenham, and Enfield – and there is no London borough with above-average affordability.The East Midlands dominates the top of the table, with five of the top 10 most liveable places, and the south-west scores best overall.Brian Cronin, head of Your Housing Group, said: “The big ide in living standards this report exposes is a direct result of the private sector’s failure to build enough affordable homes in the right places, and we are calling for a much bigger role for housing associations to fill the gap. What we need, though, is the ability to access private as well as public finance and we will be publishing new ideas for this later this summer.”The report identified “where exactly we need more new homes that meet the needs of the majority of people on modest earnings”.Alex Cunningham, the shadow housing minister, said: “By looking at the cost of housing in its wider context – availability of jobs, average incomes, quality of schools, safety of an area – we get a much fuller picture of Britain’s dire housing crisis. This research shows that, from Stockton to Southampton, hard-working families are facing a crisis of liveability.”The country needed more affordable homes, investment in skills and education, and more money for our police, he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2b22994ea7bf3ee1708a9497e6dc03de3dce03f/70_0_2647_1588/master/2647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=528645177e939dcf81a49c669a7be954","title":"dina asher smith proud to finish second in 100m final in quality field","story":"• Asher-Smith lost out to Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce • Lynsey Sharp and men’s 4x100m relay excelled in victoryDina Asher-Smith was given a close-up view of what it will take to become a true sprint champion as she lost the 100m final at the Anniversary Games to Jamaica’s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce.

She also held off a late challenge from the Ivorian athlete Marie-Josée Ta Lou to hold on to second place. But she was also able to watch her rival Fraser-Pryce as she crossed the line, the 32-year-old Jamaican finishing 0.14sec ahead in a time 9.78sec.“To have placed really highly in that kind of field, which could have been a World or Olympic final, I’m really proud of myself, ” Asher-Smith said after the race. “It’s always a privilege to line up against so many fantastic women but particularly against somebody who is double Olympic champion, world champion, been there, done that, got everything and knows how to do it. It’s a learning experience.Fraser-Pryce paid compliments to the field after a race that leaves her well placed for success in Doha. “Female sprinting is a height right now and It’s incredible to be able to race with these ladies. My aim for Doha is definitely to be on the podium. For me, it’s a long season from here so I am hoping my experience will come into play.”One notable British success came from Sharp who won a tightly fought contest in the 800m. In a field lacking the dominant presence of Caster Semanya, Sharp recorded her best time in three years after she pulled away on the final bend from a group that included the Australian Catriona Bisset and Jamaica’s Natoya Goule. The 29-year-old recorded a time of 1min 56.61sec, four seconds off Semanya’s world-leading time this year.“It’s nice to get a win because I’ve had a lot of losses over the past couple of years,” Sharp said. “I’m still working on different things in training, trying to stitch things together, but I’m learning every race. Me and Catriona are good friends, we wanted to make it a really competitive race and I think we did.”In the opening event of the day the men’s 4x100m relay team recorded a world-leading 37.6sec to finish ahead of Japan and the Netherlands. The race was defined by faultless baton changes and a dominant third leg from Richard Kilty, the 29-year-old informally known as the Teesside Tornado. Kilty described the performance, which is also the team’s fastest since 2017 as “amazing” and said: “We had fun and were relaxed and were able to let loose on every leg.”There was another world best time recorded in the women’s 5,000m race, where Hellen Obiri emerged from a tough duel to win in 14:20.36. As with the 800m, a group of three broke out to lead the race for the majority of the distance and Obiri only took the lead with 200m to go, kicking on ahead of the Dutch star Sifan Hassan. Agnes Tirop also came through to finish second just one fifth of a second behind Obiri in a personal best. It was a PB too for Hassan, the multi-discipline star who broke the world record in the mile just two weeks ago.Elsewhere there was an underwhelming return from Mutaz Barshim in the men’s high jump and an unremarkable women’s long jump despite the strong field. There was also disappointment for the Olympic and World Champion Omar McLeod in the 110m hurdles. Running against one of the strongest fields of the weekend, the Jamaican could only finish third after he was caught in the final 10m sprint by the Chinese athlete Xie Wenjun. Xie finished in a time of 13.28, way off the world leading times and symptomatic of a race with a dozen felled hurdles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a926d32caabcd81a94f3b596db42147dc0deb97/137_0_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05f4b7c0694be6118b34936a18f7dbb7","title":"england australia womens ashes test match report","story":"Australia have retained the Women’s Ashes after the only Test match of the series ended in a draw at Taunton.The visitors chose to bat out the afternoon after England avoided the follow-on and declared on 275 for nine but they were unable to take the necessary wickets needed to bat again.Elysse Perry was the pick of the Australian innings, reaching 76 not out as captain Meg Lanning decided not to set England a fourth-innings target.England sit 8-2 in the series across multiple formats and could force a draw with victory in all three Twenty20 matches but Australia came into this series as holders.Australia went into the Test match leading 6-0 from the ODIs and only needing to avoid defeat to ensure they retained the Ashes.England started the day on 199 for six chasing Australia’s 420 for eight declared, but their battle was dealt a blow early on when Anya Shrubsole was stumped for 11 after being beaten by Sophie Molineux who claimed her fourth wicket of the match.With 19 needed to avoid the follow-on, Nat Sciver played on off the bowling of Jess Jonassen for 88 before Laura Marsh and Sophie Ecclestone combined in a ninth-wicket partnership which saw England over the line.After passing the follow-on, England captain Heather Knight immediately decided to declare with her side trailing the Australians by 145 runs.Australia survived until lunch before Marsh took two quick wickets in five balls including Alyssa Healy as England relied on spin to try to take the wickets required to allow them to bat again.Lanning, who hit a half-century in the first innings, was dismissed for 21 but the Australians continued to use up deliveries and put pressure on the bowlers.With the game increasingly slipping away, Tammy Beaumont took a great catch to dismiss Beth Mooney at short leg off the bowling of Ecclestone, reaching low and to her right.Bringing herself on to bowl after tea, Knight took two wickets, Jonassen and Ashleigh Gardner, but could not find the breakthrough to dismiss the in-form Perry before both captains shook on a draw.Raf Nicholson’s report will follow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ba3c1cb08cdc745d1a0878c5d70e8bc6fd78467/232_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8d9abba65f43b02ccb698af81a340df","title":"leeds rhinos hull fc super league match report","story":"With six rounds to go, the intense drama of the Super League relegation battle shows no sign of letting up – much to the chagrin of anyone associated with Leeds Rhinos.At various junctures this season, the eight-time Super League champions have lured their fans into believing brighter times lay ahead – there was even one such example here on a dramatic afternoon in West Yorkshire.Having trailed 20-6 midway through the second half, Leeds seemed set for a routine defeat against a Hull side chasing success on numerous fronts. Yet two tries from Tom Briscoe either side of an Ash Handley interception in a blistering 12-minute passage of play put the hosts ahead for the first time and hope was renewed for the Rhinos.Victory, and another significant step towards safety, seemed on the cards. Yet while the Leeds sides who swept all before them over the past decade did not know when they were beaten, this current crop have the trait of throwing away winning positions all too often. Within seconds of going ahead, the Rhinos dropped the resulting kick-off – and what happened next had a familiar feeling about it.Leeds did their best to hold Hull out, but, when Ratu Naulago ed over in the corner with seven minutes left and Marc Sneyd converted from the touchline, this time there would be no comeback – and with London winning on Sunday, the Rhinos are once again joint-bottom of the table and time is running out.“We’ve got a dejected changing room, but still a determined one,” said their coach, Richard Agar, whose emotions were in stark contrast to that of his counterpart. Hull have a Challenge Cup semi-final against Warrington next week but before that there was the opportunity to right a particular wrong from their recent history.Hull had not won at Leeds for 12 years before this and, after tries from Bureta Faraimo and Sika Manu put them in control at half-time, Jamie Shaul’s scintillating long-range effort, coupled with a penalty from Sneyd, left many feeling their Headingley hoodoo was set to end with some ease. Leeds, however, at least deserve some credit for making a firm contest of it.“I haven’t got any fingernails left, that tells you what you need to know,” Lee Radford said. The Hull coach watched as Briscoe ed over in the corner, before Handley collected an errant pass to race the length of the field and reduce the gap to two. Then, with Leeds sensing a potentially season-defining chance, they kept the ball alive long enough for Briscoe to score his second, making it 24-20.But when the Rhinos made the most crucial of errors – Agar called it the biggest moment of the match – it shifted the focus back on to Leeds’s defence, which was eventually breached when Naulago ed over. The final and most decisive act was Sneyd’s. Surely everyone knew what was going to happen next, though, as he converted from the touchline to deepen the Rhinos’ woes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a5ac2f85e1a93a9c8a52cd6a76362e82e1fc64b/0_59_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48e851326fc0316d0f1119e43254a22d","title":"shane lowry wins open 2019 golf","story":"Padraig Harrington, Graeme McDowell, Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke … Shane Lowry. We will soon have to amend the great book of Irish cliche to include reference to golf. This small island has now returned 10 major victories since the Open Championship of 2007. Begorrah.Lowry’s procession towards the Claret Jug, as the wind howled and rain battered down at Royal Portrush, really was the stuff of dreams. He walked to the 18th tee on Sunday evening knowing he could take nine and still win. On the Open’s first departure from the UK mainland since 1951, in the country where golf has always been afforded a united front as ision defined so much else, the man from County Offaly refused to wilt.Some sniffily question whether or not golf’s level of athletic pursuit even qualifies it as a sport. The endurance shown by Lowry here delivered the perfect counterpoint. He did likewise to those, including somewhat ungraciously some of his fellow professionals, who publicly wondered whether not closing out the 2016 US Open from a winning position would negatively affect matters here. Lowry cantered – and smiled – his way to ultimate glory. By the 72nd hole, he had to fight his way through delirious punters just to reach the green. Northern Ireland and the Open has proved a fruitful combination Lowry revelled in his appearance at a venue where he prevailed in the North of Ireland Amateur Championship, 11 years ago. “I feel like it’s an out-of-body body experience,” said Lowry. “What a day.”Before today the winner of the 148th Open was not even the most famous sportsman in his own home. Brendan Lowry, the golfer’s father, was a prolific scorer as an All Ireland football championship winner in 1982. A year ago at this very event, Lowry was at the depths of despair and split with his long-term caddie when en route to a missed cut. The promise displayed when Lowry won the Irish Open – when still an amateur – in 2009 was in danger of being undermined by harsh reality. Golfing fortune and high-profile reward apparently favour the good guys at the age of 32, Lowry has marched his way into illustrious company. His is a hugely popular success.The margin of victory depicts a comfortable afternoon for Lowry, the first bearded winner of an Open since Bob Ferguson pocketed £47 5s at St Andrews in 1882. Lowry – now £1.55m richer – prevailed by six, at 15 under par, from Tommy Fleetwood. The scale of Lowry’s performance is highlighted by numbers his closing 72 was his highest round of the Open by five.There had, though, been brief cause for Lowry to fret. As he took to the 1st, JB Holmes and Rickie Fowler in the groups immediately ahead had whacked tee shots out of bounds.Right on cue, a tetchy four shots left the champion with 5ft for an opening bogey as Fleetwood stared down a birdie chance from not much further. Fleetwood’s putt slid past Lowry punched the air when saving five. Further missed opportunities for Fleetwood culminated at the short par‑four 5th, where he traded birdies with Lowry having had just 10ft for an eagle. At that stage, 17 under played 12.By the 11th tee, Lowry’s minus 16 had Fleetwood requiring binoculars from second place at 10 under. In illustrating his wonderful competitive spirit, the Englishman cut that lead by two but a double bogey at the 14th was a significant blow to his Open aspirations. Lowry slammed the door on Fleetwood with a birdie three on 15. Only one of the great sporting capitulations of our time could halt Lowry from there it did not transpire.The scale of the afternoon squall meant those safely ensconced in the clubhouse made ground – and money. Tony Finau’s 71 afforded him third place. Bob MacIntyre, on his Open debut, shared sixth with Tyrrell Hatton and Danny Willett at minus five. MacIntyre punched his ticket for Sandwich in 12 months’ time with that finish.Brooks Koepka was unlike Brooks Koepka when dropping shots on each of holes one to four. Still, his 74 meant a tie for fourth with Lee Westwood. The latter’s back nine of 38 will sting.In proving how golf can be far from elementary, Holmes totally capitulated after three days at the forefront of proceedings. His 87 left him in a tie for 67th, a rather extraordinary scenario given his showing from Thursday through Saturday.McDowell was visibly moved by the scenes at the 72nd hole as he completed a final round of 77. The former US Open winner, whose home is Portrush, played such a key role in the Open’s return to the north Antrim coast. McDowell admitted he had “heard the whispers” the last major of the year could be back by 2024 but, for now, there is no more than that. McDowell’s most effusive praise, fittingly, was for Lowry as the champion-elect simultaneously battled the elements on the back nine.“I remember the first day I met him,” McDowell said. “I had just shot 61 at Baltray, the week he won the Irish Open. He came in and shot 62, he didn’t even introduce himself, he said: ‘I can’t believe you beat me by one out there today.’ And I’m like: ‘Who’s this kid?’“We’ve become very good friends. I’ve always respected his game so much because he’s very ballsy. He’s a phenomenal driver of the ball. He’s maybe the best chipper I’ve ever seen. He’s a great kid. He would be a great Open champion.”Soon, there was no “would” about it. Shane Lowry: Open champion. The Emerald Isle’s love affair with golf’s greatest stages is as harmonious as ever. Some craic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/219b36220541d444741aeb94ac70b58d86bfb67a/0_168_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32ae8bc97c1a3ed23944958f2486a972","title":"australia v new zealand netball world cup final live","story":"Maria Folau and Ameliaranne Ekanasio starred as the Silver Ferns withstood a late Australia fightback to win their first world title for 16 yearsNew Zealand collect the trophy as the ticker tape flies. Time for me to sign off, but keep your eyes peeled for Erin’s report shortly – here’s a PA take for the time being. Thanks for joining me, and congratulations New Zealand.New Zealand held off an Australian fightback to win their first Netball World Cup since 2003 with a dramatic 52-51 triumph in Liverpool. The Silver Ferns’ success completed a recent revival after they had failed to medal for the first time at last year’s Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.Leading by six points midway through the penultimate quarter, the underdogs saw their lead begin to dwindle and a pair of late interceptions from Casey Kopua proved crucial in protecting their lead.Their win, which was greeted by a court invasion from substitutes and team staff, brought immediate retribution for the single-goal defeat they had suffered to the same team in the group stages on Thursday.And it gave them their first world title since their win over the Australians in Kingston, Jamaica in 2003 - since when their opponents had turned the tables with three consecutive crowns.New Zealand coach Noeline Taurua said: “Our country and our clubs all had to be on board to pull the best out and strengthen our competition and it was case of method to madness. “It’s been a long process and we’ve come through different stages and I’m so happy that it’s come to this end and we’ve been able to lift the cup up.”Despite their traditional dominance, Australia had headed into the tournament with questions to answer after the hurt of losing a home Commonwealth Games final to England last year.Those questions increased after a baffling semi-final selection decision by coach Lisa Alexander, who benched her star players and watched South Africa come within two goals of pulling off a momentous shock.Big names including the captain Caitlin Bassett were back for the final but New Zealand matched them through an even opening quarter then edged in front by the half-time interval.Maria Folau led the scoring charts for the Silver Ferns but it was the uncanny accuracy of team-mate Ameliaranne Ekensasio that began to make the difference as her team started to turn on the style.Kopua’s brilliance stifled the inevitable Australian comeback and the Silver Ferns were able to hold onto the ball and count down the final seconds amid a fittingly raucous atmosphere in Liverpool.There are tears from the Australians as they finally get their silver medals. That’s a long time to stand and wait for a medal you don’t really want. Emotions are running high among the Silver Ferns too, as they collect gold medals that seemed a world away on the Gold Coast last year.While we wait, here’s Emma John’s report from England’s bronze medal win, and Tracey Neville’s farewell:We’ve basically had the entire closing ceremony done before the medals and trophies are done. Liverpool’s mayor, Joe Anderson, has just passed the baton to Cape Town, who will host in 2023.“What an amazing tournament this has been,” says Molly Rhone, president of the International Netball Federation. “Congratulations especially to our winners, the Silver Ferns. What a thrilling final that was.”The New Zealand, Australia and England squads are all out for the trophy and medal presentation, lining up behind a podium that runs the length of the court.“Congratulations Silver Ferns,” writes Pearl Matahiki. “Meinga meinga –Aotearoa is very proud.” Here’s Clare Balding to kick off the trophy presentation. She dishes out praise for New Zealand, Australia “for setting the bar so high”, England for bouncing back today, and South Africa for heading a record four African teams in the top eight.There’s a closing ceremony underway inside the arena, with both teams off the court and the trophy still sitting there, unclaimed. I’m sure New Zealand will be back out to get it soon enough.A few stats from the final, then. New Zealand had 61 shots to Australia’s 57 the Diamonds had a better shot accuracy overall, while Maria Folau was the top scorer with 28.Both teams intercepted five times, while Australia conceded more turnovers (19-15). Perhaps the most telling statistic is penalties – Australia with 82, NZ with 49.New Zealand have a population of less than five million. They’ve won World Cups in rugby union, rugby league, netball – and so nearly cricket, too. Not forgetting a mighty haul of sailing silverware. Are they, as a nation, the biggest sporting overachievers on the planet?The trophy presentation is coming up. What a terrific performance that was from New Zealand – they knew it might be their last shot and used every last drop of experience to hold off Australia’s late charge. Not forgetting that they had a marathon battle against the hosts barely 24 hours ago. That trophy has been won the hard way.A reminder that at last year’s Commonwealth Games, New Zealand didn’t even claim a medal. They lost two group games, were thrashed in the semi final by Australia – and lost the bronze medal game to Jamaica. In the final, meanwhile, Australia lost to England by a score of 52-51.Lisa Alexander, the Australia coach, is putting on a brave face after that defeat, talking of fine margins. They lost by one goal, but Alexander’s decision to shuffle the team for the semi-final, and her half-time changes, will come under scrutiny. Australia lost their lead at the end of the first quarter and never got it back.Casey Kopua, playing her last NZ game after coming back from retirement, is on the verge of tears. “It feels so good – I can’t really find the words. Go the Fossils!”Here’s Noeline Taurua, the winning coach: “I’m quite speechless, I don’t know what to say. Our fossils stood up for us today! For us to come out and win this, it’s huge for our netball community, and for New Zealand.”Her contract runs out tomorrow safe to say there’ll be an extension in the post.Wow. What a performance. What an upset! No World Cup heartache for New Zealand this Sunday.New Zealand keep the ball under enormous pressure, Laura Langman unflappable on the ball – and Australia just cannot force a turnover. The hooter sounds, and New Zealand have done it!!!Q4 00:30 Aus 51-52 NZ Tippett with another goal – she’s yet to miss a shot – and it’s down to one! Ekenasio restores the two-goal lead, but Australia rally, and it all comes down to this...Q4 01:59 Aus 49-51 NZ Klau comes up with a big steal of her own, and Tippett cuts the gap! Two points, two minutes to go...Q4 02:20 Aus 48-51 NZ Ekanasio brings up the fifty, keeping her percentage above 90 – and then Katrina Rore with a huge steal! NZ break, Ekanasio scores another, and New Zealand have a three-point lead!Q4 03:45 Aus 48-49 NZ Australia keep pressing, chasing, but New Zealand are being so patient in attack, and Folau restores the two-goal cushion. Bassett shows great footwork and cuts it back to one. This is breathless stuff.Q4 05:00 Aus 47-48 NZ Gina Crampton finds Folau with a terrific reverse pass, and the goal shooter can’t miss. Kopua, playing her last international match before retirement, nearly pulls off a vital interception, but NZ keep their noses in front...Q4 06:48 Aus 46-47 NZ The pressure is cranking up like a vice here, and Folau leaves one short. Bassett, a beacon of reliability, weighs in with two big goals – and the gap is down to one.Q4 08:29 Aus 43-46 NZ Ekenasio with a rare miss – but she moves like lightning to grab the rebound before it goes out of bounds. On the bench, Taurua is absolutely loving that – and at the other end, Kopua makes a big interception! Ekenasio adds another from range – how crucial could that passage of play be?Q4 10:06 Aus 43-44 NZ Australia just keep chipping away – they haven’t led since the first quarter, but it’s the end result that matters. The Diamonds are disrupting NZ’s attacking flow, but Ekenasio does net a penalty to keep them in the lead.Q4 11:56 Aus 41-42 NZ No changes for New Zealand. Have they got the legs? Australia have started fast here, but Folau gets the Silver Ferns on the board. Kopua attacks Tippett at the other end, but the ball rebounds for Bassett. The gap’s down to one...Q4 13:38 Aus 39-41 NZ An error from New Zealand – Folau’s overthrow slipping beyond Langman. Tippett steps in under the post and the gap is down to two!Brace yourselves. There’s a World Cup to be won. Lisa Alexander’s Australia, or Noeline Taurua’s New Zealand? Let’s find out.Ian Swan isn’t happy: “Eugh. CBass off her goals, Klau and Tippett making no difference, and the umpires picking up every infringement. Momentum with the Diamonds, but if the Ferns find some fresh legs, it’s theirs to lose.”Is this the start of a comeback? Bassett - the only Australian who played in the 2015 final – picks up a couple of quick points. Folau, and then Bassett, are penalised when poised to score – and Australia shuttle the ball down the court, only for Bassett to delay and run out of time. The nerves are kicking in! 15 minutes to play...Q3 02:15 Aus 35-41 NZ Klau gets another caution, this time for persistent contact. Tippett, meanwhile, has grown into the game and combines well with Bassett. Crompton with an absolute Hollywood ball over the top to Folau, and April Brandley replaces Price in wing defence.Q3 06:22 Aus 30-36 NZ New Zealand look much more fluid in attack, their defence constantly denying Australia space. A better gameplan, or the effect of the Diamonds’ changes in the semi-final?Q3 07:28 Aus 28-35 NZ Tippett is cautioned for persistent contact – and now Folau intercepts. Ekenasio, staying cold as ice amid the tension, finishes from the edge of the circle. Tippett gets on the score sheet, but Folau is on target again, and the lead is seven.Q3 10:00 Aus 26-32 NZ Ekenasio extends the lead to five, before Bassett tries to play in Tippett. She stumbles and hits the post. At the other end, Klau is cautioned for dissent. A rough start for Australia’s newcomers, and Folau stretches the lead to six!Q3 11:53 Aus 26-30 NZ Gretel Tippett. What a name. Anyway, the new GA overthrows on her first foray forward, but does find Bassett shortly after. Klau, who featured in the semi-final, is unable to clutch the rebound from Folau’s miss, and the ruthless Ekenasio pounces.Gretel Tippett replaces Steph Wood in goal attack, while Sarah Klau replaces Bruce as goal keeper.The second half is imminent. New Zealand good value for that lead, dug out right at the end of the second quarter – but can they maintain this intensity?“NZ scoring seemingly at ease, whilst Australia are making hard work of everything - including defence. Diamonds in trouble unless they take corrective action,” reckons Ian Swan.Liz Watson almost makes a crucial interception on Folau, but New Zealand score and then turn it over themselves. Ekenasio with a lovely arcing effort, followed up by Folau – and the Silver Ferns carve out a three-goal lead!Q2 02:00 Aus 24-24 NZ ...but Australia step up the pace to force an interception! The scoring has crept up from the first quarter, and Folau is finding her range – another inch-perfect effort, before Bassett counters from under the post.Q2 04:30 Aus 20-21 NZ Watson and goal-defence Casey Kopua are penalised for nudging Bassett, prompting boos from the Kiwis in the crowd. The high pressure from both teams is leaving gaps, and Bassett is picked out with a precise long pass from Jamie-Lee Price. Bassett then misses not once, but twice from close range...Q2 07:35 Aus 18-18 NZ A rare miss from Bassett after good work from Wood, but Australia snatch the rebound and she doesn’t miss twice. Folau is left all alone and picked out by a long pass, but Bassett levels up once more.Q2 10:10 Aus 15-15 NZ There are more spaces opening up after that full-throttle first quarter. Bassett and Ekenasio both on the scoresheet twice in quick succession, still nothing to split the teams.Q2 12:08 Aus 12-12 NZ The Silver Ferns take the lead after a series of defensive fouls eventually allow Ekenasio. Steph Wood finishes from the edge of the circle to level up, before Folau’s long-range shot from wide left rattles in. Bassett levels – Australia’s front two yet to miss a shot.“The Kiwis’ intercept game is forcing Australia to play short. Scores square at quarter-time seems entirely fair,” says Ian Swan. Agreed – they’ve been working relentlessly to try and force turnovers.Aus 10-10 NZ Bruce blocks Folau’s latest effort but NZ keep the pressure on, with NZ captain Laura Langman triggering a fluid attack and finding Folau in acres. No mistake this time, and Ekenasio levels moments later. Australia look to break but Watson tips away from Bassett, and it’s level at quarter time!Q1 02:11 Aus 10-8 NZ New Zealand get to within a point, but an attacking move breaks down. Australia break and Bassett gets a telescopic arm to a pass, before doing the necessary.Q1 04:21 Aus 9-7 NZ New Zealand are being kept under pressure, but have frustrated Bassett on a couple of occasions to keep them in range – and Ekenasio nets with a fine effort from distance.Q1 06:57 Aus 8-4 NZ This game has started at a blistering pace, both teams fighting to put pressure on the ball carrier. A clever looped pass from Steph Wood finds Bassett, before Folau lets a pass slip through her fingers. Bassett strikes again from under the post, but is denied on the next attack by the tenacious Jane Watson.Q1 09:33 Aus 6-3 NZ Bassett finishes off a flowing Australia move, and the Diamonds pounce on a defensive error to move three goals up...Q1 12:00 Aus 3-3 NZ Bassett gets the first score before Maria Folau (yes, Israel’s wife) levels after a fine take. At the other end, Jane Watson intercepts to deny Bassett, but Steph Wood converts the rebound. Folau then misses a couple of chances, before Ekenasio levels it up.The Liverpool crowd save their biggest cheers for the Silver Ferns as the teams are announced. Kiwi expats, or locals rooting against Australia?Anthems time! If the coin-toss is anything to go by, we’re in for a close game...Tracey Neville bows out with a third-place finish, after England powered to a 58-42 win over South Africa in the bronze medal match. It’s not what they really wanted on home soil, but a medal’s a medal.In case the fancy graphic is a bit hard to read...The three sweetest words in the English language: World Cup final. And this has all the ingredients to be a classic of the genre, with two old foes taking very different paths to the grand finale.This is the eighth Netball World Cup to use a knockout format, and the seventh final to feature Australia and New Zealand. Australia have won five of those six prior meetings, and have beaten their Antipodean arch-rivals in the last three finals.The Diamonds will start as clear favourites, but were pushed all the way by the Silver Ferns in their group match, before winning 50-49. Lisa Alexander’s side then almost came a cropper in their semi-final with South Africa after rotating their squad.New Zealand will be much less fresh, but the adrenaline should still be surging from their dramatic win over the hosts, England, on Saturday. In a World Cup peppered with close finishes, don’t bet against another today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b243ecd96fcb8978eeb488ef6ffc4f05711927d/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00ad054a422939659a636b4bd4b3b53c","title":"the open fourth round live","story":"And so the 148th Open Championship comes to a close.

Thanks so much for reading.“I can’t wait to wake up tomorrow morning, and find out what it’s going to feel like then. It’s just going to be incredible!” What a lovely quote that is. All the innocent, childlike joy of winning one of sport’s most famous prizes, laid out bare. Lowry becomes the sixth Irish major champion, after Fred Daly (1947 Open), Padraig Harrington (2007 and 2008 Open, 2008 PGA), Graeme McDowell (2010 US Open), Rory McIlroy (2011 US Open, 2012 and 2014 PGA, 2014 Open) and Darren Clarke (2011 Open). Golf’s an all-Ireland sport, so play nicely.And now Lowry, cradling the jug in his arms, talks to Sky. “This feels like an out-of-body experience. I was so calm coming down the last! I couldn’t believe it. What a day. It was difficult out there, the weather was so hard. I wasn’t going great during the middle of the round, but then I took a look at the leaderboard and saw everyone else was struggling, and then it became a two-horse race between me and Tommy. And that was good for me, I think, because I could focus on Tommy as far as I could. I told my caddie that I couldn’t stop thinking about winning, but he said: stay with me, stay with me. And kept on my back. What a job he did. I can’t wait to wake up tomorrow morning, and find out what it’s going to feel like then. It’s just going to be incredible!”“With a score of 269, the winner of the gold medal, and the Champion Golfer of the Year, is Shane Lowry!” The big man is introduced to the crowd, and he waves to the stands before taking receipt of the Claret Jug and hoisting it into the air. Then his speech. “I love this place. It’s one of my favourite places in Ireland. To be able to come up here and play in an Open Championship is great!” Then he pauses and takes a breath before he thanks his mum and dad. “They sacrificed so much for me when I was younger, and I’m so happy I can hand them this trophy tonight!” His voice cracks, he wipes away a tear. He thanks his wife and daughter, it’s so special that they’re there. And lastly the fans. “Thank you so much! This one’s for you!” Not a dry eye in the house!Lowry’s in the scorer’s hut right now, bouncing off the walls. He doesn’t know what to do with himself right now. “That was so stressful!” he laughs. Not sure whether he was talking about that final round, checking his scorecard, or making his way through the crowds, because everyone wanted a piece of their hero. Anyway, everything’s been checked and double-checked, and the presentation ceremony will take place in short order!There had been plenty of talk about an Irish champion being crowned here at Portrush this week. Most of it about Rory McIlroy. That wasn’t to be. But few thought Shane Lowry - who missed the cut at the last four Opens - would take the prize here. Try to tell that story on Thursday morning, and most folk would have filed it alongside the tale of Finn MacCool building the Giant’s Causeway with his bare hands. Here we are, though! And good lord, but it’s been thoroughly deserved. That blistering outward run of 31 on Friday. Yesterday’s course-record 63. And all the big shots, careful chips and ice-cool putts today, whenever they were required to steady the ship as he battled to land his maiden major. An Irish winner in Ireland is one of the great Open stories ... but let the record also state that this was one of the great Open performances as well. Sensational Shane!He very nearly drains a fairytale birdie putt. Not quite, but who cares?! He taps in for par. A final round of 72, and he’s won the Open by six shots! The biggest margin of victory at the Open since Louis Oosthuizen triumphed by seven at St Andrews in 2010. He throws his arms into the air, embraces his caddie, then his wife Wendy, then his daughter Iris, then Tommy Fleetwood. An Irish champion in Ireland! The fairytale is written!Tommy Fleetwood lags his long birdie putt to a couple of feet. He cleans up for par, and a 74. He ends the week in second place ... his second runner-up finish in the majors ... and is rewarded with a lovely ovation. Next time, Tommy. But now he gives the stage over to Lowry.Fleetwood sends his second just off the back of the green. It should ensure he finishes second, a result he thoroughly deserves. But this is all about Lowry, who finds the green with his second, at which point Portrush erupts! He opens his arms out as wide as they can go, a celebration of triumph perhaps, though you can imagine he’s trying to hug the atmosphere, throwing his arms around the world. This is one hell of a party already! The ole-ole-oles ring around the 18th, as he grins the widest grin. His partner flashes him a similarly sparkling smile, their daughter in her arms. Their eyes meet. The sweetest moment. He punches the air. He’s about to win the Open!Lowry clips an iron down the fairway at 18. That’s the last big job completed. He looks to the heavens and blows hard. Fleetwood follows him down. Up on the green, it’s par for Koepka, who ends with a 74. He’s tied for fourth, at-6, his worst showing at a major this year.But it’s an embarrassing 16-over-par 87 for JB Holmes. A couple of sevens and a couple of sixes on the way back, having gone out in 41. Back in 46! He’s +6, after starting the day just six off Lowry’s lead. My, my, dear me.Two-putt pars again for Lowry and Fleetwood. As Ireland’s hero makes his way to the 18th tee, through a tunnel of ecstatic supporters, he steadfastly refuses to take up any of the many high-five offers. He’s taking nothing for granted. Unlike the R\u0026ampA engraver, who has already etched his name onto the Claret Jug! But fair’s fair, Lowry has a six-shot lead. Jean van de Velde would have closed it out at Carnoustie in 1999 with a six-shot lead.Up on 18, Justin Rose signs for a thoroughly awful final round of 79. One of the pre-tournament favourites just never got going today. It’s a 74 for Rickie Fowler, meanwhile, who did well to keep it together after spraying that opening drive out of bounds. He’s -5, and it’s another high finish at the Open without reward. One day, Rickie, one day.Lowry knows this is done. His face has betrayed his nerves a couple of times today: at the 1st and 2nd, then again during that mid-round run of bogeys. But he’s found his neutral space again. An easy tee shot down 17, then a glorious swish into the heart of the green. Fleetwood’s on in two as well, fine work after a wild drive, but this is all over now. An eerie silence descends on the 17th, almost as though the crowd are saving themselves for the big party at the 18th green. Mind you, it’s all Lowry can do to stop himself from breaking into a premature grin! He’s fighting it. He may as well not bother, though, because it won’t be too long before he’s crowned Champion Golfer!Two-putt pars for Shane Lowry and Tommy Fleetwood on 16. It’s close now. So close. The crowds close in on Lowry as he makes his way to the 17th tee. It’s a struggle for him to make his way through. The celebrations haven’t quite started already, but folk are gearing up for a good time. Meanwhile Danny Willett is the latest player to feel the love of the Portrush crowd, as he finishes with a round of 73 at -5. But Brooks Koepka uncharacteristically yips a short one at 17, and he’s back to -6. Very much a day to forget for the current PGA champion.It’s been a miserable day for an awful lot of players. Jordan Spieth shot 77, ending back at -1. Henrik Stenson finished with a trio of bogeys a 76 that puts him down to -1. Also at -1, Cameron Smith, who shot 76 as well. And now Lee Westwood nearly drains a long birdie putt on 18, but it fails to drop, and his aborted fairytale ends with a disappointing 73. He’s given a lovely warm reception, though, and he smiles broadly as he bows theatrically. He ends the week at -6, the sort of high finish few expected at the start of the week.Lowry clears another hurdle, as he carefully threads his tee shot at 16 onto the front of the green. No time for heroics now. Fleetwood needs a miracle now - even an outrageous hole-in-one wouldn’t make the sort of gains he needs - but he can only send his tee shot just off the front left, and there are dramatic undulations between his ball and the hole. A simple two putts for Lowry, you’d think, but a lot of work to do for Fleetwood for his par.Lowry strokes in his birdie putt! That’s put an end to a difficult run of holes, and he must know this Open is his now. He clenches his fist and pumps the air, bending over with the intensity of the moment. All Fleetwood can do is par, and the Portrush gallery, literally dampened during the tempest, spiritually so as Lowry stumbled a little, erupt in excitement. This is on! It’s really on now!And you fancy Shane Lowry is going to win one of these today! He clips a gorgeous wedge pin high at 15, and he’ll have a look at birdie from ten feet or so. Fleetwood surely has to match him, but can only send his to 30 feet. He trudges up to the green with a drained expression on his face. It’s not going to happen for him, unless something very strange and dramatic unfolds quite soon. Meanwhile birdie at the 18th for Jon Rahm, who smiles broadly at the end of a difficult 75. He ends his week at -3.Tony Finau nearly rakes in a monster on 18 for birdie. It doesn’t drop, but he’s signing for a level-par 71 to end the week at -7. He’s the only one of the late starters not over par. So this’ll be his second top-five finish in the majors this season, after Augusta, and consecutive top-ten finishes at the Open. You fancy he’ll win one of these one day.Fowler can’t make his birdie putt on 16. Such a shame after a lovely tee shot. Koepka birdies 15, his first of the day, and he joins Finau in third place at -7. And back on 15, Lowry and Fleetwood both find the fairway with their tee shots.Rickie Fowler hits one of the shots of the week at Calamity, the long par-three 16th. A low fade that curls into the front of the green, ten feet to the right of the flag. Meanwhile back on 14, it’s yet another bogey for Lowry, as he cradles his putt to the hole. No big problem, because Fleetwood has putted up from the bottom of the bank, and left himself a 15-footer for bogey. He really has to make it. He doesn’t make it. It slides by the right of the cup. A double, he cups his face in disbelief, and the lead is five again - but now there’s only four to play! Lowry so close now to realising his dream.A real poser for Fleetwood, who is chipping blind over the hillock, from an angle that takes the bunker on the other side into play. He tries to flip into the heart of the green, and finds the short stuff, but his ball topples off the right and into the swale. He hangs his head, knowing perhaps that the jig might be up. Especially as Lowry clips up to 15 feet. Not a gimme for par, but he’s in match-play mode now. So long as he matches or betters Fleetwood’s score, he’ll be heel-kicking his way to the next tee.Birdie for Rickie Fowler on 15! Unfortunately it comes after a run of two bogeys and a double in five holes. Still, he’s back to -6, and with the conditions doing a number on all the late starters, that’s a precious shot in the pursuit of a high finish that’ll make him feel a whole lot better once the sting of missing out on yet another major subsides.Lowry whisks a hot one out of the rough. It skitters hysterically through the green, and he’s fairly fortunate that it stops in the first cut at the bottom of the swale. A few more inches, and he’d be chipping up from the thick, tangled tat. Fleetwood meanwhile opts to go for the green from the sand, 134 yards away. It’s short and right, and in some real bother behind a filthy hillock.Fleetwood pearls a 3-wood over 300 yards. Too good. It’s into the bunker down the left of 14. Lowry tugs his tee shot into the thick rough down the same side, though his ball looks to be sitting OK. It’s visible from a distance, anyway, which has to be a good sign. Alex Noren signs for a 74 after coming back in 38 he finishes at -3. Bogey for Lee Westwood at 16 he’s -6. Meanwhile Xander Schauffele had an absolute nightmare today, out in 38, back in 40. His 78 won’t improve his mood at the end of a week in which he feels he’s been hung out to dry by the R\u0026ampA. He ends up at +2.Fleetwood’s putt is huge in the context of this Open. You’d think if he misses this, it’ll steady Lowry’s ship, which, while not yet rocking, has been gently swaying for the last 30 minutes or so. But in it goes. That turns the pressure back on Lowry, and though he makes his putt, it only just drops, threatening to turn left before the lip grabs the ball and swallows it down. Gulp. A couple of pars. But boy did they have to work for them.Fleetwood, down the bottom of the swale, opens the face of his wedge and goes full Mickelson. He delicately lobs up onto the green - there’s not much of it to play with in front of the flag - and he leaves it ten feet short. Another must-make putt coming up, because Lowry splashes out from the wet sand to three feet. If this was match-play, it’d be advantage Lowry. It sort of is match-play. Advantage Lowry, then.Fleetwood’s tee shot at the par-three 13th bounds over the back of the green. Not great. Lowry meanwhile tugs his into a huge bunker to the left. Not ideal either, but it looks as though he’s got a decent lie, and a splash out from sand is surely better than a chip up from the swale.What a perfectly paced putt by Shane Lowry! He rolls his ball 50 feet up the green, sending it to rest just to the left of the cup. So nearly a sensational birdie, but he’d have taken two putts for his par. That suddenly puts a little bit of pressure on Fleetwood’s eagle effort. He surely needs to go for it, but can’t afford to trundle it way past. So he underhits it! It’s two feet short! That is incredibly poor in the circumstances. Then again, it is a birdie in difficult conditions, and suddenly Lowry’s lead is only - only! - four. Here’s the top-ten countdown.Now then. Lowry wedges in from 110 yards. It only just reaches the green. He’s left with a long birdie putt up. Having made three bogeys in the last four holes, these are worrying times for Ireland’s hero.Lowry chops back onto the fairway. The door slightly ajar for Fleetwood. And he sends a long iron into the heart of the green, allowing the camber on the left to bring his ball pin high to 30 feet. Meanwhile the JB Holmes horror show continues to unfold. He sends his second at 12 into awful muck at the back of the green, and though they find his ball, he’s forced to take an unplayable. His second double bogey of the day, to go along with a triple, and having started at -10 this afternoon, he’s tumbled in extremely ungainly fashion all the way down to level par.The crowd falls quiet, as they wonder whether the tide could be dramatically turning. On the par-five 12th, Fleetwood bashes a lovely drive down the middle. Lowry’s tee shot sails off to the right and disappears into the freak kale. Much may depend on how both players respond to this position. Can Fleetwood parlay this advantage into something meaningful on the scoreboard? Or will Lowry escape from a tight spot and refuse to give ground?News of Lee Westwood, who you’ll have noticed has slipped to -7. Bogeys at 11, 12 and now 13, and his week is beginning to unravel. Perhaps, having allowed himself to dream the unexpected dream, the will has now gone. After so many disappointments in the majors, you can kind of understand it. A little boost for Justin Rose, though. He’d bogeyed 3, 6, 8, 9 and 11 to tumble down the rankings, but he strokes in a 20-footer on 12 to rise to -4. Back with the final pairing. Lowry and Fleetwood are both on the green in regulation, but both have long putts for birdie. Fleetwood’s never looks like dropping, but he taps in for par. Lowry’s takes off as it leaves the face of his putter, though, and speeds eight feet past the hole. He’s left with a knee-knocker coming back. He pulls it left, perhaps his worst stroke of the week, and that’s his fourth bogey of the day, his third in the last four. The lead is down to five, which looks like a done deal, but when you’re chasing your first major, nothing is certain.Up on 18, Patrick Reed ends with a level-par 71. He’s -4 after his week’s work. His playing partner Justin Thomas signs for a 72 and he’s -3. Not looking too happy, either, after that triple on 17 cost him a few places. Henrik Stenson and Alex Noren take turns to bogey 14 they’re both -4. And a bogey for Danny Willett on 13, and he’s -7 again. With the wind up - and more rain heading this way, by all accounts - quite a few of the folk in the clubhouse will find themselves in very healthy positions come the end of play.Brooks Koepka struggles his way up 11. He nearly salvages the situation with a long par saver, but the ball stops a turn short. It’s his first bogey since that horror four-bogey start, and he slips back to -6. He’s having a shocker, though nothing compared to his playing partner JB Holmes, who at one point was spotted up the left of 11, his head barely poking out the top of the tall rough, squirting a wedge straight right and into the punters on the other side. He runs up a triple bogey, and clatters all the way down to -2.Lowry splits the fairway at 11. Fleetwood finds the semi-rough down the left. Meanwhile on 12, Westwood three-putts from distance, and he trudges off knowing all hopes of an unlikely fairytale are thoroughly extinguished now. Finau overshoots the green at the par-three 13th and it costs him a shot he’s -7 again. And a birdie for Willett, who snatches back the shot he’d dropped at 11.... pulls his par putt to the left. “It was almost classic match-play,” notes Laura Davies on Sky. She’s not wrong. Lowry looked in a little bother there, but sunk his putt and turned all the pressure onto his opponent. And suddenly there are six shots in it again! That could have been the moment that sealed the deal for Lowry. Neither Lowry nor Fleetwood can find the fairway at 10. And neither can find the green in regulation. Fleetwood bumps his third up from the front to four feet, and will have great chance of saving his par. Lowry gives himself a bit of work to do by chunking a chip from a tufty bank just over the back. He’s got a six-footer across a seriously sloping green. But in it goes! That’s a brilliant putt in the circumstances, and suddenly the pressure’s back on Fleetwood, who ...Tony Finau moves into fourth spot after birdie at 12. He’s -8 and on course for his second top-five finish in this year’s majors - he was tied fifth at Augusta - and consecutive top-ten finishes at the Open, having tied for ninth at Carnoustie last year. Danny Willett will soon join him, following bogey at 11 by nearly slam-dunking his approach into the cup at 12. He’ll tidy up for a bounce-back birdie.Tyrrell Hatton threatened to challenge at times this week, but never quite maintained the required consistency. He’s had a fine four rounds regardless, and signs today for a 69. He’s in the clubhouse at -5, alongside Bob MacIntyre, and the pair are currently looking good for an invite back next year. Meanwhile the 2016 champ Henrik Stenson, who had stumbled out in 39, has since birdied 10 and now 13. He’s -5.With some proper links weather having finally rocked up at this year’s Open, just in time, a few players are moving backwards. Bogey for Finau at 11 he’s -7. Willett follows bogey at 9 with another at 11 he’s -7 too. A double for Fowler at 10 he’s -7 and has just hooked his tee shot at 11 into green mince. And Thomas, who had been going along nicely, bogeys 13 then runs up a triple at 17 after losing a ball. He’s -3.Lowry gives his putt a little bit too much on the left. That’s back-to-back bogeys for the leader, and he turns in level-par 36. Fleetwood knocks in his par effort, and he turns in 37. Just (!) the five in it now. Meanwhile Westwood, who had birdied 10, hands the shot straight back at 11.Lowry demonstrates the importance of taking your medicine when you’re in the jungle. He arrows his third from 140 yards to 15 feet, straight at the flag. A decent chance to save his par. And he’ll want to make it, because Fleetwood clips a wedge up the big green and spins his ball to a halt a couple of feet from the flag. It should be a birdie. It should be.Lowry can only punch out from the rough. Fleetwood’s lie isn’t so bad, and he’s able to lash an iron towards the green, though the wind is so strong, covering the distance is beyond him. The rain has stopped again, so that’s something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4031779406abef59f8a2bbb771005a2026494cd/0_223_3394_2036/master/3394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d52e320704478b591c9b64f056f279f0","title":"hamlet richard iii review glasgow botanic gardens bard in the botanics","story":"Glasgow Botanic Gardens A superb Nicole Cooper plays Hamlet as a fiercely wronged daughter, while a stripped-down version of Richard reveals an impulsive gambler on a wild streakNicole Cooper’s Hamlet is putting the first player through his paces. Warming up for the performance that will catch the conscience of the king, the actor gives her an impassioned speech in praise of Hecuba. His pretence at emotion sends her into a reverie. “What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he should weep for her?” she asks. “What would he do, had he the motive and the cue for passion that I have?” Her answer, that “he would drown the stage with tears”, is the key to her superb performance.In Gordon Barr’s outdoor staging for Bard in the Botanics, Cooper is emotionally exposed. She weeps in mourning as mother Helen Logan and uncle Alan Mirren tuck into their wedding feast. She sobs after meeting her father’s ghost, and fights back the tears on “to be or not to be”. Her eyes well up when Stephanie McGregor’s Ophelia returns her letters and she wails upon the death of Alan Steele’s Polonius.In silky grey skirt and black shirt, this Lady Hamlet is driven not by revenge or intergenerational aggression, but a deeply felt sense of bereavement and injustice. At least once, she has to shake her hands in front of her face just to keep her composure. This heightened emotional state explains her madness when the world makes no sense, where’s the advantage in thinking straight? It also fuels her anger at Mirren’s Claudius, a suave captain of industry with slicked-back hair and an air of confidence that makes him look unassailable. If she hesitates to act, it’s because his crime seems unpunishable.It’s not all tears, however. Cooper is an actor with tremendous range, hitting peaks of ferocity and lows of despair. She’s not morose nor introspective, as Hamlets can be, just an amiable woman caught off guard. Sometimes Barr’s actors yield to the pull of naturalism and talk to each other instead of singing out to the audience, but not Cooper, who never loses her hold over us. It is a performance of unassuming authority, her delivery clear, fresh and true.Meanwhile, indoors in the neighbouring Kibble Palace glasshouse, Jennifer Dick is staging a lean Richard III, stripped down to just four actors and delivered in a brisk and lucid two-and-a-bit hours. Robert Elkin’s Richard, one arm hitched pathetically into a belt around his chest, is a glass-half-empty kind of psychopath, more inclined to moan about his lot than relish the successes of his murderous enterprise. He’s like a gambler taking no pleasure in his wins save the opportunity to gamble again. Wild-eyed and impulsive, he grows from embittered to vitriolic as fate turns against him.His cynical wooing of the women he has bereaved, first Kirsty McDuff’s Lady Anne, then Vanessa Coffey’s Queen Elizabeth, relies on angry oratory more than charm, which makes their capitulation hard to credit, but both make fearsome adversaries. McDuff, in particular, has a bright confidence, standing her ground in the face of this malevolent force. Like Adam Donaldson playing the Duke of Buckingham as an obsequious politician, they speak with clarity and muscularity.With its modern-day setting, Dick’s production uses press conferences and one-way phone conversations to get around some of the elisions of her compact adaptation. If it necessarily loses a sense of Richard’s wider world and misses some tonal variety, it is nonetheless a vigorous and assured production.

Even if the pieces are uneven in quality, the sextet makes a coherent package proving that Durang is the most theatre-obsessed dramatist alive.The climactic title-work, dating from 1981, shows a nervy accountant (Stefan Menaul) thrust unprepared into a play that starts as Private Lives and ends as A Man For All Seasons: it’s a potent piece in that it taps into the universal nightmare that in life we all find ourselves in inexplicable situations where everyone but us knows the lines. Even more chilling is a sketch in which Meaghan Martin plays, with a marvellous mix of ingratiation and panic, a collapsing standup who pleadingly asks: “Do you find me funny or disturbing?” On a lighter note, Martin also appears to great effect as a Hollywood hustler meeting a dithering dramatist (Adrian Richards) to persuade him to write a movie about a rabbi who falls in love with a priest.Durang is good when he is specific about the fears and fantasies of showbusiness: less so when he generalises, as in a feeble satire on American drama which simply amounts to a series of name-checks. But I laughed most, in Lydia Parker’s breezy production, when Kate Sumpter appeared first as an audience member asserting that Greek tragedy produces “slight irritation” rather than pity and terror, and then as a classical Medea surrounded by a chorus claiming: “We are so upset we speak in unison.” Durang’s territory may be limited but he occupies it with a certain elan.

You’ll find the next generation of choreographers and dancers in two laudable initiatives from Sadler’s Wells: the Young Associates, four choreographers in their early 20s and the ambitious National Youth Dance Company, all aged 15 to 24, here performing Madhead by 27-year-old Botis Seva. Look at the dance they produce and it’s clear these young people have a message, but that message seems to be: we’re doomed. Hope, schmope.Environmentalism is strong in the Young Associates show. “You set planet Earth on fire!” accuses Ruby Portus’s retro-futurist activist-comedy Port Manteau, while Wilhelmina Ojanen’s confident Land gives us dreamy forest people who lose their earth, trees, community and trust. People crumble too, lost and despairing in Christopher Thomas’s To the Ocean Floor. Anthony Matsena’s happy tribe disintegrates into darkness in Vessels of Affliction, iniduals destroyed by the system (a piece with too many ideas thrown at it, but a strong central performance from Kennedy Muntanga).The works are wildly varied in style, but perhaps the main takeaway is just how hard it is to make choreography, even when you’re this talented. Jokes don’t quite come off, voices are not yet found, drama’s undercooked or overdone. Still, they have skill, energy and ideas to build on.Botis Seva is a more established choreographer, and his experience is clear. Seva comes out of east London’s hip-hop scene and makes powerful work that sparks with friction, disaffection, mental struggle and the gregarious energy of youth reined in with tight discipline.His style centres on the physical contradiction between frozen tension and explosive pugnacity, manifesting as the inevitable eruptions of fear and frustration that people try to keep clamped inside. Madhead uses the seriously impressive NYDC dancers in tight militaristic manoeuvres. They’re taking aim, but who the enemy is isn’t clear. Inidual moments of human connection and compelling short solos resonate against the ensemble’s sometimes repetitive routines.

Flicking the thrilling “turbo” switch on the dashboard, I rocketed skyward.Well, perhaps not quite skyward, but what is claimed to be the world’s only all-electric classic VW campervan for hire made easy work of it. To be honest, that was out of character as it’s a vehicle that actively encourages pottering. Often I had the impression I was careering madly along an open road only to glance at the speedo and find I was not quite doing 30mph. But it was the most not-quite-doing-30 fun I think I’ve ever had.Kit had picked me up in his electric car at Knaresborough station and taken me the short distance to eDub HQ in the village of Farnham, North Yorkshire.“She’s called Indie,” he told me during an introductory tour of the jolly green-and-white van. “She was built in 1973 and came from a small town called Andrews in Indiana.”Inspired by his mother’s PhD on battery technology and “vehicle-to-grid stuff”, Kit converted the van to a right-hand drive, had a local cabinet maker fit it out (“getting every inch of space to work”), and changed the engine for a mighty battery that provides a range of 50 miles on a full charge. “But it’s an ongoing project,” he added, “constantly being tweaked and improved.”Meanwhile, Volkswagen has been doing some tweaking of its own, with plans to launch a new electric version of the classic campervan. The ID Buzz will stick close to the original design, with a new colour motif and style quirks.After a spin around the block to show me how Indie worked, Kit let me loose. Winding down the window (do you remember that? Our arms had motor skills in the old days) and slipping it into first – surprisingly, it’s a three-gear manual, but won’t ever stall – I set off on an adventure around the Yorkshire Dales.My eerily quiet carriage took me first to Ripley, where I stumbled upon the Harrogate Tipple gin and rum distillery. “The shop’s been open two weeks,” distiller Steve Green told me among bottles of blueberry, gooseberry and premium gins. He spoke so enthusiastically of the subtle qualities of various botanicals that I was disappointed to be driving and unable to try his samples.After a dip into Ripon and its cathedral, I headed for Masham to pick up some beer from the Black Sheep Brewery (for later consumption, you understand). With a double gas hob, sink, fridge, plentiful cupboard space and a back seat that converted into a comfortable double bed, the van had everything I could desire. Its huge steering wheel also made me feel as if I was driving a giant dodgem car. And just being inside it was a pleasure. Indie had me stopping to pop the kettle on and the top up on lonely moorlands and in obscure villages whose names only a Yorkshire tongue could love. Here’s to you, Grewelthorpe, Nidd and Wath. Even the showery weather couldn’t dampen my spirits, for as the wipers scraped doggedly back and forth, the rain infused the van with that wonderful “old car” smell which took me tumbling back to infancy and my grandmother’s faithful Austin 1100.One lunchtime, pootling along a back lane in the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, I noticed a sign to the Himalayan Garden \u0026amp Sculpture Park and immediately swung off in pursuit. Set in a slender glaciated valley, the 45-acre garden was adorned with rhododendrons, magnolias, azaleas and plentiful flowers I’d never seen before. There was a particularly fetching Himalayan shepherd’s hut, constructed in the kath-khuni style without nails or mortar. And of the 70 outdoor sculptures, my favourite was by Indian artist Subodh Kerkar, who had satirised 14th-century traveller John Mandeville’s claim that he’d discovered a tree in India that bore “tiny lambs” as fruit. It had been the Englishman’s first brush with the cotton plant.I had my own brush with the lesser-known valley of Nidderdale, discovering Ramsgill’s church hidden behind an explosion of popcorn-pink cherry blossom. Reaching Middlesmoor, at the head of the dale, I jumped out for a walk on to In Moor, only to be assailed by hailstones. I took this as nature’s way of telling me to head for a campsite. And at Studfold – one of many sites where you can charge the van overnight for free – I found the owner Ian celebrating its 60th anniversary.“The creation of the campsite started by accident,” he said. “An angler turned up at what was then my grandfather’s farm and asked if he could pop his caravan in a corner of a field.” It was a spot well chosen, as it has cracking views of hills to the east. By contrast, the previous night I’d stayed at the Old Station caravan park outside Masham, whose reception – once a goods shed – is lined with black-and-white photos of the former branch line stop axed by Dr Beeching.On my final day I bimbled into Pateley Bridge for a stroll along River Nidd and a visit to the self-styled “oldest sweet shop in England”. Ten minutes later I was gnawing on a Pontefract cake at the local art group’s biannual exhibition. Feeling reckless, I bought tickets at the tombola stall and – boom! – snared a pack of pop-up cupcake boxes. Winners gonna win.It was only when getting back on the train that I discovered the one downside to my trip: my cheeks ached. But that’s what comes of spending 48 hours with a great big stupid grin on your face.• The trip was hosted by eDub (edubtrips) Indie can be hired for £149 a night (including campsite) for three- or four-night trips.

Why? And is it time captions became the norm?‘Subtitles aren’t just for deaf people,” read the tweet that started it all. “Lots of my hearing friends use them, too. If you’re hearing and using subtitles on Netflix and TV, and would quite like them at the cinema, please retweet to help normalise their presence!”This recent post by @deafgirly (AKA Deafinitely Girly) swiftly garnered close to 75,000 likes and a deluge of replies. “I was confused at first when I saw it had gone viral,” says the 30-year-old blogger and campaigner from London, who prefers to go by her Twitter name. “I was out for lunch with my mum and my phone started going crazy. I was really pleased though, because there was overwhelming global support from people of all ages for subtitles. Even the people who said they didn’t really like them at the cinema said they’d tolerate them if it meant deaf people could attend more screenings.” One woman even told DG she used subtitles when she was too stoned to listen to her favourite shows.As the tweet and its many replies made clear, it’s not just deaf people who rely on subtitles in 2019. What was once a question of accessibility and a mainstay of foreign-language broadcasts is becoming an inescapable part of visual media. In a piece for US site The Outline earlier this year, journalist Sean Neumann claimed that closed captioning saved his relationship with Game of Thrones, by allowing him to read and process the huge amounts of information in each episode. (“Wait, who’s Lord Mormont again? And he’s different than Ser Mormont?”)Elsewhere, TV memes with captioned dialogue have become the norm on social media No Context Twitter accounts – which orce a show’s script from its original meaning – are springing up.Among the many replies DG received were lots of teenagers and people in their early 20s who said they liked using subtitles because it allowed them to multitask. Besides, with TV shows often plagued with claims of unintelligible ambient sound (Shane Meadows’ The Virtues being the latest), it’s little wonder that subtitles seem to be all around.A startling Ofcom study from 2006 estimated that, of the 7.5 million UK TV viewers using subtitles, only 1.5 million had a hearing impairment. That figure may be 13 years old, but the regulator says: “Our understanding is that subtitle use has increased as the use of smartmobile devices has increased, as more and more people watch programmes or videos on commutes.”Intriguingly, it seems that subtitles seem to appeal particularly to children. Henry Warren is the co-founder of Tots, or Turn on the Subtitles, a new campaign urging programme-makers to add captions to shows aimed at primary school pupils. Inspired by research conducted by an Indian academic, Brij Kothari, Warren and his business partner Oli Barrett decided to see whether broadcasters would take note of stats linking subtitles to hugely increased levels of literacy.Warren sees Tots’ role as “joining the dots” between academic bodies such as the National Literacy Trust and big broadcasters, initially with the aim of making subtitling the norm for programmes aimed at children aged six to 10. “I think it will come to a point where we don’t think about it,” he says. “They will just be there.”But what do deaf people think? Anna Gryszkiewicz, who is 39 and lives in Östergötland in Sweden, was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in her 20s and began using captions. Mostly, she sees the rise in captioning as a positive development: “It has been so much easier to find or to request captions today, compared to 15 years ago.” Deaf people, she adds, “have such an advantage living today”.The rise of big tech brings with it concerns over the quality of subtitling. YouTube uses often garbled, computer-made captions. “My main worry is the over-belief in technology, such as autocaptions,” says Gryszkiewicz. “I’m an engineer and love technology, but we cannot lose sight of the social aspects of hearing loss. Language, communication and social interactions are complex. The effect of having hearing loss or being deaf is different from what hearing people imagine it to be – and the impact on communication is often underestimated.“I understand that good captions and other accessibility features are expensive and it’s not unreasonable to look into technology to reduce costs, but I hope our opinions are taken seriously when we try to explain what kind of accessibility is helpful and what isn’t.”“I find my deafness incredibly isolating at times,” says DG. “You miss out on jokes on social media videos, viral clips don’t mean anything, and you can’t follow the latest news that’s being live tweeted. Subtitles being universal would change that massively.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ef8d0c64a48a817f08458796665c4000739390e/0_196_5714_3428/master/5714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03c52485d2da729b27c66ec319a927f6","title":"animal rights activists accuse latitude festival cruelty pink sheep stunt","story":"Animal rights organisations and activists have accused the Latitude festival organisers of cruelty for dyeing a flock of sheep pink as part of a marketing campaign.A promotional tweet posted on the opening day of the Suffolk event showed fuchsia-dyed sheep running across the festival grounds. Social media users quickly criticised the organisers for dyeing the sheep and demanded an explanation.Latitude defended the stunt, and tweeted that the animals had been “dip-dyed using natural, water-based dye which they are used to as part of their normal farm life for insecticides and parasites like itch-mite, blow-flies, ticks and lice”.But the animal rights organisation Peta UK condemned Latitude’s actions as a “thoughtless, attention-grabbing stunt”.“In 2019, only ignorant or cruel people still use animals as living toys, props and photo ops,” it said on Twitter. “We’ve learned enough about animals to know to respect and admire them for their ability to live in a world we’re fast destroying.”Peta said the dip-dyeing of the sheep “involves being completely submerged in liquid, their heads likely held down with a crook. And the abuse didn’t stop there. These gentle prey animals are easily stressed and would have been terrified of the loud music and rowdy, drunk festivalgoers.”The animal welfare charity RSPCA also expressed criticism, saying it was “very sad” to see sheep being treated in this way.A petition has been set up calling on Latitude to stop using the sheep as “party props” and to remove the animals from the festival grounds.Members of the public announced a boycott of Latitude and called on others to follow suit.East Suffolk council said on behalf of Latitude that it had “no concerns about the sheep this year or in the 14 years that this activity has taken place”.“We are entirely happy that the water-based dye is completely safe and that the festival organisers have taken all appropriate steps to ensure the animals are content, safe and well-looked after,” the council added.“As part of our wide-ranging licensing and environmental health responsibilities, the council takes the welfare of all animals very seriously and if we had encountered any issues or felt that the sheep were suffering distress of any kind we would not permit such an activity.”The festival in Henham Park, which this year featured headline sets from Lana Del Rey and Snow Patrol, is billed as a family festival with a broad cultural programme alongside activities such as lake swimming and wellness treatments.Latitude was named best major festival in 2017 and best family festival in 2018 at the UK Festival awards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cf731626b8b3c03d2484d6bdf720fc1924de69b/0_365_5157_3094/master/5157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51268cfbf215cc0155234db8e44c00a6","title":"catalonia plans to introduce outdoor smoking ban barcelona","story":"Proposed changes would outlaw smoking outside bars and restaurants, in sports grounds and carsSmoking is set to be banned on the outdoor terraces of bars and restaurants in Catalonia as well as in bus shelters and on train platforms, under proposals from the region’s health authority.The ban would also extend to open-air sports facilities and inside cars.The proposed changes, which could come into force within a year, are certain to meet fierce resistance from the hospitality industry. Ever since smoking was banned indoors, the number of venues with outdoor spaces has grown , with terraces serving as de-facto smoking areas making them no-go zones for anyone who does not want to breathe in second-hand smoke while enjoying a beer or a coffee.Bar and restaurant owners in Barcelona are already at war with the city authorities, who claim that many of the terraces are illegal and occupy too much public space.At present, smoking is permitted only on terraces that are entirely or mostly in the open air. However, the health authorities claim the law is frequently flouted in enclosed outdoor spaces and plans a series of inspections.At a national level, the Spanish government is considering raising the price of tobacco and banning smoking in cars when children are passengers. A packet of 20 cigarettes costs less than €5 (£4.50) in Spain compared with about £12 in the UK.If they are introduced, the new regulations would be similar to those in force in the Canadian province of Québec, where it is prohibited to smoke within nine metres (30ft) of any building that is open to the public."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac84d8c5aac2c5e7fe40207682ab20db7546e95/0_266_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f297b480b8307095b3a1417af523d65","title":"jerusalem jaffa gate new imperial hotel final showdown","story":"Standing on a balcony at the New Imperial Hotel, overlooking Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem’s Old City, 75-year-old Walid Dajani last week declared a one-man war on Jewish settlers.Officials from Israel’s supreme court had served an eviction notice against Dajani following a ruling last month that the disputed 2005 sale of the historic 40-room hotel to a radical settler group was valid. The Jewish settlers’ organisation Ateret Cohanim immediately branded him “a squatter” and threatened to seize the building. Such a move would establish a strategically valuable settler presence just inside Jaffa Gate, the main entrance to the ancient city’s Christian Quarter.According to Dajani, the settlers – who seek to create a Jewish majority throughout the Old City which, along with East Jerusalem, was annexed by Israel in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 – are enacting “the rape of Jaffa Gate”. His family has owned land on nearby Mount Zion for 800 years, and has run the New Imperial since 1949. “From this moment I am embarking on the fight of my life,” he said, calling on Christians, Muslims, Jews and world leaders to fall in behind him. “On my back, they will take me out.”So far his appeal for international support has been met mostly with silence. But earlier this month, local Christian leaders, terrified of the political and religious consequences of the settlers’ takeover, demonstrated inside Jaffa Gate.Archbishop Theodosius Attulah, spokesperson for the Greek Orthodox church, criticised the supreme court decision, saying the sale was fraudulent. “The Christian properties have been a target for 70 years, but this is the most dangerous so far. It is aimed at marginalising Palestinian influence and weakening the Christian presence in the Old City. It will not be tolerated.“Jerusalem is sacred to the three monotheistic religions, the purpose of the move is to transform the city into a place of hatred and struggle,” he said.The showdown is the culmination of a lengthy court wrangle dating back to a suspect secret sale of Greek Orthodox-owned properties to settlers, authorised by a now deposed Greek Patriarchate. Three properties were involved: the New Imperial Hotel and the Petra Hotel, both in the Jaffa Gate plaza, and a house in the Muslim Quarter.The Greek Orthodox church, the largest private landowner in Israel and the occupied territories, has often sold property in East Jerusalem to Jewish settlers who deploy dubious means to secure deals. The New Imperial Hotel was sold behind Dajani’s back, despite the fact that he is a protected tenant, and the $1.8m deal for the three properties was signed by a Greek official who has since disappeared.Michael Sfard, a leading Israeli human rights lawyer, said it was hard to believe the supreme court ruling would stand. “The price itself should have shown this was suspicious. It’s the cost of a two-bed flat in Tel Aviv,” he said.“The hotel is priceless,” said Dajani, whose protected tenancy was legally agreed with the previous Greek patriarch for three generations. “The furniture alone is worth half a million,” he added.The hotel boasts spacious dining areas, tea rooms where Black Forest gateau is served, hallways decorated with ornate early-Ottoman carvings and pictures of famous guests including Kaiser Wilhelm II who visited Jerusalem in 1898. In pride of place is a photograph of General Edmund Allenby who entered Jaffa Gate on foot in December 1917, after winning the Battle of Jerusalem and addressed crowds from the Imperial’s balcony.Dajani fears representatives of the settlers will seek entry to the hotel any day. He has been watching his security cameras and monitoring suspicious activity on hotel booking websites. He says he has learned that hotel “clients” linked to the settler group had taken rooms in the hotel through Booking and were already inside the property. He has closed the rooftop restaurant to prevent incursions from adjoining buildings.He invited the EU delegate in Jerusalem to book rooms at the hotel for each member country as a show of support and to prevent a takeover by “fake guests”, but received no reply. “They didn’t even drop by for a coffee to show support.”Since Donald Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem last year, recognising the city as Israel’s capital, European diplomats have floundered, unable to show alternative leadership. Meanwhile, the demoralised Palestinian community in the city is carved off by the imposing separation barrier from the Palestinian Authority based in Ramallah in the West Bank.On Friday, however, Dajani received news that an appeal to King Abdullah of Jordan may bear fruit. Feelers had also been put out to the Vatican, and a visiting official from Jeremy Corbyn’s office had dropped by with messages of support.Dajani was most cheered by support from Russian president Vladimir Putin, reportedly under pressure from the Russian Orthodox community to call for the sale to be annulled. This led to a former Israeli chief of staff, General Giora Eiland, to warn that a settler seizure of the properties “might create a crisis for relations between Israel and the Christian world and bring negative relations with the Russian president”.Even so, looking across from the Imperial’s roof to the Dome of the Rock, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the city’s other sacred sites, Dajani’s shoulders slumped a little. “We have to do the impossible,” he said. “When I look at the walls opposite, I see them cry, asking: ‘Where are the people who love Jerusalem?’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e7f7f14f27f0a90a4754c5b8652510dc0d2d3d9/0_98_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f90723637c6b09ce2d7f803390873618","title":"support for women afraid to say no","story":"As a single woman who worked as a sexual health adviser in the NHS for almost 20 years, off and on, I would like to commend Ellie Mae O’Hagan for her insightful piece on consent (No wonder women are still afraid to say no, Journal, 18 July).In a culture that is noticeably sexualised, where hardcore porn is easily available and shared by young people via their phones, with no regard for “parental control”, the “world where women are afraid to say no” is indeed a reality.Unfortunately, even saying “no” is rarely enough. I have experienced times when I thought my clearly expressed feelings were overruled by someone I considered to be a friend, someone I trusted. As a young girl I was constantly reminded that I should remain a virgin and not get pregnant, but these strictures are no longer considered relevant. Some years ago, I found myself dealing with a 14-year-old girl in tears because she was being bullied for not having sex with her male classmates. And of course there are the ever-popular insults of “slag” or “bike” for the girls who have “a reputation”.Before I retired a few years ago, I found myself often expressing to my colleagues that women were no longer clear on how or why to say no, that they were becoming sexually active much younger, and abortions were on the increase. It is a sorry state, indeed, but at least the #MeToo movement is bringing women’s experiences into the light and providing some support for those (and they are many) who have been abused.Rowan FergusonWells, Somerset• Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with  readers?

Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPA   Out on the course at Royal Portrush, it feels like magic is in the making. The first British Open golf championship to be held on Irish soil in almost 70 years, and a potential Irish winner.As Shane Lowry tees off, the roar of the crowd is deafening. “Come on Shane,” they shout, phones held aloft to record the moment. The cheers reverberate around the course, as if tracking his progress from hole to hole. At the 18th, the Irish flag stands out.At 16 under par, Lowry started earlier on Sunday with a four-shot lead among those watching is Niall Morrissey from Co Kildare.“It was an unbelievable day yesterday,” he says. “We saw most of Lowry’s round - that 63 was incredible.“It puts a whole different spin on the day to have an Irish guy in the lead. I was at Carnoustie when Padraig Harrington won, and I’ve only been to the Open twice.”Might he bring Lowry luck? Morrissey laughs. “Well, he’s in good shape now. It would be incredible if he won.”Out on the course the Irish contingent are much in evidence. Along the ropes which mark out the course, tricolours are held aloft one man is dressed head to toe in a shamrock-patterned suit.“It has the feel of a home game here,” says Morrissey. “It’s Northern Ireland and it’s Ireland and it’s golf. Just the prospect of a home winner would make the weekend a whole better prospect.”‘No borders’Of the 200,000 spectators who have come to Portrush for the Open, more than half of ticket sales were to people from outside Northern Ireland. On the course, accents from all over Ireland mingle with Scottish, American and Australian tones if they have one thing in common, it is their insistence that talk of a border does not belong here. “There are no borders in golf,” is an oft-repeated phrase.“Golf is an all-Ireland sport,” explains Michael Callaghan, from Strabane, Co Tyrone.“Protestants and Catholics have always played golf together, and that’s the way it should be. It’s not a Protestant sport or a Catholic sport, it’s a universal sport, which unites people through their love of golf. Sport breaks down barriers.Not quite everybody. Two men wear jackets with the Northern Ireland football team logo “we’ll tell you what we think as long as we don’t have to give our names,” they tell The .“To be totally honest, it’s the first time in 70 years the Open’s been here and it’s a bit galling to see all the Tricolours out. I’ve a Red Hand of Ulster here in my bag, just in case,” he explains.Both stress that this is not meant in a sectarian way. “It’s just that it’s sort of Northern Ireland’s moment in the sun, and we won’t quite get it if Shane Lowry wins - though it would also be great if he won.“We’d just have loved to have seen Rory in the final.“But there’s been absolutely no aggression here - even McIlroy said he’ll play for Ireland in the Olympics and nobody thinks any less of him for that. There’s pretty much no ide any more.”‘Sense of unity’Stephen McGrath and his friends agree. In the wind and rain on the course, their Hawaiian shirts and sunhats are attracting plenty of attention.“Well somebody’s got to dress for the weather you want,” says McGrath.They are all from Belfast some see themselves as British, some as Irish. “We don’t think there’s any difference - it doesn’t come into it,” he explains. “Not for our generation anyway. It’s not what we’ve grown up with. We’re beyond that - nobody cares any more.”If Lowry wins, he has more than simply the Claret Jug coming to him. “We’re going to present him with one of our shirts.”Brian and Mary O’Higgins are just as confident. From Oranmore, Co Galway, they are queuing under a golf umbrella to get up to the stands for a better view.“Sport knows no boundaries, and there shouldn’t be any in politics,” says Mary. “It’s been fantastic - even travelling up here was so easy, and there’s just such a sense of friendship out here on the course.“To think that this is here in Northern Ireland after all the years of turmoil, it’s wonderful.“At one stage it all has to be left behind and we have to move on,” adds Brian. “There’s an all-Ireland rugby team, and Shane’s a sportsman at heart - of course his father was a great GAA man.“There’s a real sense of unity in sport.

The Co Down man   was deported from the US in 2013.A Co Down man who was deported from the US in 2013 says he does not have much advice for Cork native Keith Byrne because the country’s immigration system is “ruthless.”Cormac McGrady (45), who was sent home after being arrested for a public nudity offence while skinny-dipping with his wife on holiday in Delaware, says he cannot offer encouragement to others given his experience during his deportation.Mr McGrady, who now lives in Newcastle, Co Down, was applying for his green card as the husband of US citizen Caitlin Vennard when his arrest, six years ago, started a chain of events that led to detention in a Pennsylvania detention centre for three months and being walked handcuffed onto a flight out of the US.The Northern Irish man said that given his experience he would be “very surprised” if Mr Byrne (37), who was arrested in Philadelphia last week for overstaying a short-term visa waiver, was allowed to remain in the country.The two men’s cases are strikingly similar.The Cork father of three, who is married to a US citizen, signed an application for an Irish passport on Friday, which could pave the way for his deportation, though his lawyers are exploring further avenues to halt his deportation.“If it ends up that he is deported, he needs to take it on the chin, get moving quickly and get over here and get your life moving again, as quickly again. I didn’t want to waste my time,” said Mr McGrady.“We are sort of at the stage where it has been six years to the day and really happily it is very much to the back of my mind.”Sense of helplessnessMs Vennard said that the couple, who lived in Arlington, Virginia and worked in an Irish pub in Washington DC at the time of his arrest in 2013, filed a “stay of removal” to halt the deportation but it just delayed the process.“That’s what took three months. I don’t know if it would have went any quicker if we hadn’t applied for it. It wasn’t a sentence. He wasn’t charged with any crime. That was the amount of time for the paperwork to go through in 2013. It was the usual bureaucratic silliness,” she said.Ms Vennard recalls the sense of helplessness during the deportation process and being “left with our hands tied” because an inidual waives their rights if they overstay an ESTA visa waiver.Like Mr Byrne, Mr McGrady travelled to the US on a 90-day tourist visa waiver. The Co Down man, who works as a tiler in Newcastle, encountered a delay in the processing of his US green card after marrying Ms Vennard in late 2012 due to his arrest over a minor incident during a holiday to New York city in 2001.He was arrested for buying a homeless man beer and the arrest record was required for his green card application but there was a delay in finding it. Both of his US public order offences were later expunged.BannedMr Byrne’s applications for a green card were refused due to previous minor offences for marijuana possession.Mr McGrady served time in two detention facilities in Delaware and one in Pennsylvania. He was banned from re-entering the US for 10 years.“It was the toughest experience I ever went through. I am sitting here, six years later, going I feel nearly better for it, I don’t think there is anything in life that could shake me after this,” he said.Mr Byrne should have no reason to be scared, he said, because he was being detained with others who were “in a similar boat” and facing deportation. He described it as a frightening experience.“You have only one option and you have got to make it work. You have got to dig in.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3963006.1563718934!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fai president seeking re election is mind boggling says shane ross","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for  Sport Shane Ross said that “if corporate kings or queens retain positions of power for too long, they can develop bad habits”. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe FAI president Donal Conway’s decision to seek re-election to the post is “mind-boggling”, Minister for Sport Shane Ross has said. Mr Ross accused Mr Conway of being part of “woeful” corporate governance by spending 14 years on the FAI board while also seeking to remain on it. In his strongest comments to date, Mr Ross said while Mr Conway “may have done a decent job in recent weeks” he had failed to see that he was part of the problem of the FAI and not the solution. Currently the Government, through its funding body the Irish Sports Council, has withdrawn all its funding from the FAI. The association has received almost €50 million from the State in the last 10 years. The Government, Mr Ross revealed, was “aghast” at corporate governance breaches within the association and the FAI “has gone walkabout”. He accused Mr Conway of reneging on a pledge that he made when he wrote to the Minister on April 16th saying that he and rest of the board would stand down at the annual general meeting (AGM) of the FAI. The AGM is due to take place in Trim next week and Mr Conway is unopposed for the role. Mr Conway said he changed his mind about stepping down after a corporate governance review recommended that up to two officers of the board should stay on for a further 12 months to help with the transition to a new board set-up.‘Bad habits’Mr Ross, in a column in the Sunday Independent, responded: “Last week he put this name forward for re-election as president of the FAI. I responded by asking him to withdraw his nomination and honour his promise. Apparently the FAI regard my demand that he keep his word as an interference! Pretty odd, as he himself publicly introduced the subject in his letter.”Mr Ross warned the FAI that the Government cannot offer financial support to the association while it continues to breach acceptable governance norms. He said: “The reason is obvious. If corporate kings or queens retain positions of power for too long, they can develop bad habits. “Accountability can go out the window. Vigilance can disappear. Pals keep pals on boards. Expenses become lax. Annual accounts are not produced in time for scheduled meetings. Numerous inquiries or forensic audits are required. All familiar sins in the FAI. Conway’s decision to stay on – even if unopposed – is mind-boggling.” He also accused Mr Conway of exhibiting an “instinctive hostility to reform” by appointing a former FAI employee, Noel Mooney, as the interim head of the organisation. He further criticised the imposition of a board quorum of just two people into the FAI’s new articles of association. “Even the corporate governance review did not recommend such a bizarre minimum number for board meetings to be quorate. “Paradoxically the rule books nominates six. Rule books are easier to change than constitutions.” Mr Ross welcomed the decision by FAI delegates to overwhelmingly pass changes recommended by the Sport IrelandFAI governance review group to improve corporate governance at the association. He said Mr Conway could have that as his legacy at the FAI if he did not put his name forward for election next week.

Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergSenior figures in the Irish Government no longer wonder about whether they will be faced with Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt as the next British prime minister. Barring a political earthquake of monumental proportions, they accept that it will be Johnson.However, they do wonder about which Johnson they will get. Irish diplomats have combed through his speeches and articles. They have gathered information, views, opinions and the countless perspectives on him that exist.The Irish Embassy in London has an exceptionally wide and effective network for taking soundings throughout the political and media world in Westminster and beyond, and they have been funnelling reports back to Dublin. Still, the view in Dublin is: we’ll wait and see what he says. The subtext: we have no idea what he’ll do. The wait-and-see stance rests upon a remarkable fact that for a politician about to reach the high office in his land: nobody appears to trust a word he says.Perhaps that’s not surprising. He has promised, repeatedly, to take the UK out of the EU by October 31st, “do-or-die”, with or without a deal. Though he has also said that once the EU sees that the UK is serious about leaving with no deal, it will consent to changes to the backstop, which would enable an orderly Brexit to happen on the agreed October date.Another Irish official puts it slightly differently: are we going to get mayor of London Boris, or foreign secretary Boris?In the mayor’s office, Johnson had strong deputies and gave them the powers to do the work he wanted done. As foreign secretary, he was disorganised, directionless, ineffectual (he eventually resigned from the cabinet over Theresa May’s Brexit policy, having repeatedly endorsed it). Even Johnson’s supporters seldom refer to his time as the UK’s diplomatic and foreign policy supremo. Throughout the campaign for the leadership, he has hardly mentioned it.Warning light here: being prime minister is an infinitely more difficult job than being either mayor of London or foreign secretary. And the stakes – for Ireland and the UK – are a lot higher. The decisions Johnson makes in the coming weeks and months will have a direct bearing on the lives of people throughout Britain and Ireland for decades to come.Brexiteer blusterIn Dublin, Ministers and officials say they are conscious of the need not to let Brexit dominate the business of government to the exclusion of all else, in the way that it has done in the UK.And yet they confess that nothing approaches the issue in importance. That will become clear once Johnson becomes prime minister and the recent otiose phase of Theresa May’s lame-duck period gives way to three months of deal-or-no-deal decision time.Dublin half-expects a visit from Johnson soon after he becomes prime minister, possibly even next week. Then there will be no extended August break for senior politicians and officials: they’ll all be back at their desks by the middle of the month, trying to figure out: which Boris?Patrick Maguire, political correspondent with the New Statesman magazine in London, says that Boris will want to be both Borises – the brash Brexiteer in order to get a new deal from Brussels, and the pragmatic centrist who can govern, and win an election, as a one-Nation Tory.Blair Horan, a retired trade union chief who researches and writes on Brexit issues for the Institute of International and European Affairs think tank, sees this possibility, too, and worries it will end up stumbling into a no-deal.If this is the Johnson plan it hinges on one very questionable assumption: that Brussels and Dublin will be sufficiently impressedintimidated by Brexiteer bluster that they will consent to a change in the backstop arrangements contained in the withdrawal agreement.That might turn out to be the case. But at present there is little evidence that it will. And there is a lot of evidence that it will not. For a start, there is a series of frequent and repeated statements from Irish and EU leaders. There is the fact that it is clearly against the EU’s interests to do so. And there is the fact, attested to by Irish and EU sources, that many people in Dublin and Brussels believe that (a) Johnson is bluffing about a no-deal and (b) even if he isn’t bluffing, parliament will stop him.Their belief in the latter – prompted by contacts with British ministers – has been bolstered by the result of Thursday’s vote in the House of Commons, which seeks to block the suspension of parliament. Even though it is not clear that parliament can effectively prevent a no-deal outcome, it is certainly clear that it will try. Having already endured the fiasco of dealing with a prime minister who could not control her parliament, this will not encourage the EU to negotiate with Johnson.‘Spoilt child’Some sources in Dublin, London and Brussels say that Johnson’s only hope of progress is to approach the EU with a realistic proposal and a conciliatory mood. The EU is not going to tear up the backstop and Johnson knows that. But a change, centring mostly on the political declaration (which charts the direction for the future trade deal) but perhaps involving tweaks to the backstop, might be a different matter. It would at least be more difficult to reject. On Thursday, the Taoiseach suggested that the backstop could be changed from an arrangement which covers the whole of the UK, to one which just related to Northern Ireland. This would, after all, mean reopening the withdrawal agreement. But it is far from clear that Johnson has either the desire or political capacity for such a nuanced approach.And whatever he says about Dublin, Johnson will be dealing not just with Leo Varadkar but with the EU, whose remarkable cohesion on the question shows no sign of slipping.And in Brussels, they think he is simply a liar and a charlatan. Having been subjected to Johnson’s malicious and frequently mendacious journalism, and having watched his championing of Brexit with growing horror, the EU is disinclined to give Johnson the benefit of the doubt.A “spoilt child of a man, who lies like a toddler and has only the vaguest of political convictions” was the description a former EU spokesman, Jean Quatremer. And yet, Quatremer reflected, “a pragmatic buffoon might be better than a fanatic”.“Many in Brussels believe he is capable of any move, even backtracking and shelving Brexit if he thinks it could be turned to his personal advantage,” he wrote.It is this personal and political unpredictability that make the forthcoming Johnson premiership, its Brexit policy and its ultimate direction so uncertain. Everyone will wait and see. But the range of possible outcomes is dizzyingly wide.“I doubt if he is sitting around talking to serious people,” says McDonagh. “My sense is that he acts instinctively . . . He will smell the air and decide where political advantage lies.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: iStockHe’s right, this angry old man in melting bronzer shouting in the July heat: Those of us who don’t like what’s going on in this country should get the hell out. “Go back,” as he said, to the “crime-infested places from which they came.” A fine idea.For me, as with more than 30 million other Americans with my hyphenate, that’s tiny Ireland, the country once so infested with crime, famine, disease and assorted horrors of foreignness that its British overlords said a merciful God was doing a favour by killing off the starving masses.So back I went to have a look. This, mind you, was just before president Donald Trump’s suggestion to his fellow citizens to get out. And also, generations after someone on my father’s side made the choice to flee for life itself, rather than fall into the cold Irish ground through the bottom of a reusable coffin.What I found on that island where typhus once took entire families as they shivered on floors of mud, where, by one medical estimate, 50 per cent of the children in Dublin once died before their first birthday, is now a land of universal health care.Health care for all residents: It’s still a surprise to someone from a nation where the number of uninsured Americans has gone up by 7 million under Trump. I had left a place where nearly 1 in 7 people are left to fend for themselves when sick, to a fully covered country, the norm in most of the industrialised world.What I found in that place where barefooted, Gaelic-speaking hordes once could not read an English sign are colleges nearly free to its citizens – good colleges, at that. Imagine, a family not having to bankrupt itself to help a child off to a better life.What I found is a republic where nearly 1 in 8 people were born abroad, nearly as high a percentage as the foreign-born population of the United States. The prime minister, Leo Varadkar, is himself a son of an Indian immigrant. His father was born in Mumbai, while his mother hails from County Waterford, the home also of my mother’s distant family.That 19th-century hellhole has become a 21st-century heaven. The Irish have become us – what we wanted and aspired to. They are living our national narrative, a country open to those fleeing oppressors and lack of opportunity. Its prime minister would never gloat over a “send her back” chant at a hatefest directed at new members of the republic.Back home in America, the unimaginable is the new norm: a fully blossoming fascism. We’re stuck in a hideous loop of hate. But it’s also an idiocy loop. Why are we arguing about something any second grader has already settled after looking around the classroom and realising that nearly every other child is a descendant of someone from a foreign land? Read the resolution the House of Representatives passed on Tuesday, citing Ronald Reagan, John F Kennedy and Benjamin Franklin, and quoting Franklin Roosevelt’s call to “remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists.” It’s the kind of immigrants-make-a-nation-stronger boilerplate that would normally pass the House with unanimous consent, but it drew only four Republican votes.SludgeThis is how low Trump has taken us. We are a debased nation fighting over the scraps of our former principles. Should someone offer a resolution saluting the “purple mountain majesties” of the United States, every Republican would vote against it if Trump tweeted against a colour that is not orange. Senator Mitch McConnell, whose immigrant wife is indirectly a target of this sludge, would say, as he did about the “send-her-back chants,” that the president is “on to something.”I’m against the dismissal of others with the preemptive pejorative of “white privilege.” It closes minds and ends conversations. But this is one case where white privilege applies. For Trump’s tweet wasn’t aimed at me. Nor was it directed at his vice president, the cipher and coward Mike Pence, himself an Irish-American.Trump’s hate blast was directed solely at people of colour. His tweet was the textbook definition of racism. And I should add in the interest of full transparency, I disagree with much of the policy initiatives of the four left-wing congresswomen targeted by Trump. It was wrong and incorrect for them to make Nancy Pelosi’s disagreement with them about race. That episode was another textbook illustration of why the far left has trouble winning a majority.But let’s leave that discussion for another day. Back in the country from which I came, the Irish appear genuinely perplexed at this American vomiting of principle. Writing in The , Oliver Sears, a British-born resident of Ireland and son of a Polish holocaust survivor, wondered how any immigrant could ever vote for Trump.I heard a similar thing when I went back: How could Irish-Americans vote for this awful man without becoming traitors to their heritage? For this Ireland has become what America used to be. If only America could be more like this Ireland.

jack tv series increases tourism anne listers yorkshire","story":"Shibden Hall in West Yorkshire has seen a sharp increase in tourist since BBC show.The manor house where lesbian diarist Anne Lister lived is to extend its opening hours to accommodate the increase of tourists following the success of the TV series, Gentleman Jack.Grade II listed Shibden Hall, in Halifax, Yorkshire, dates back to 1420 and previously had 100 visitors on a good day. Visitor numbers to the Hall, where the series was filmed, are now topping 300-400, according to museums manager Richard Macfarlane.Calderdale Council has also reported an increase in tourism in the region.The Hall will now open on Fridays to accommodate the increased interest and the council are discussing the possibility of opening the Hall during winter.Lister, who was born in 1791, is known for her extensive diaries which detailed her life and lesbian relationships.She has been described as the first modern lesbian, and was an avid diarist who wrote some five million words, equating to 26 volumes and 7,722 pages, throughout her life.The diaries detailed her life as a landowner, businesswoman, intrepid traveller and mountaineer, according to Calderdale Museums.In 2011, the United Nations classed her journals as a “pivotal” document. Suranne Jones played Anne Lister in the hit show.The hit TV drama, starring Suranne Jones, was watched by almost six million people every week when it aired in May.Some of the costumes from the BBC series, designed by Tom Pye, will be displayed at Bankfield Museum, Halifax, until October 26.Calderdale Council, who operates the Hall, said it was hoped the new opening times would be in effect before the August bank holiday weekend.The council said visitors from as far as the U.S., where the show is broadcast by HBO, have travelled to see Lister\u0027s home.Councillor Susan Press said: We want to ensure that visitors continue to have a positive experience at our museums and we are working on a number of plans to improve our offer.Visitors to Shibden Hall can journey through the lives of the people who lived and worked there, as well as taking in its mix of architecture which detail its varied history. They can also take a stroll through the restored gardens and the estate, which form Shibden Park. Comment: We need a bonfire of the regulatory quangos

manners. She\u0026nbspalso believes in charging upwards of £10k for her\u0026nbspservicesClick to followThe IndependentIt wasn’t long ago that using a dating agency could mark you as an undesirable, perhaps even a weirdo. But with the rise of the internet, using a third party to find love has become a commonplace, even preferred, method of finding a partner.\u0026nbspThis rush to find love online has, some argue, reduced the dating process to a superficial transaction. For some, the romance and ritual of dating has been lost and there is at least one introduction agency that still believes in personal contact, romance and good old-fashioned manners. It also believes in charging upwards of £10k for its services.Berkeley International was set up by Mairead Molloy in 2003 to provide a high-end, personal introduction service for the wealthy.\u0026nbspAnd although she welcomes the normalisation of finding love in this way, she does seem to hanker after a pre-social media world where, she believes, people were just… nicer.“The first couple of years of operating were easier than they are now because people were nicer, more mannerly, easier to deal with and more respectful. People were more tolerant and less bitchy,” she says.\u0026nbspWhile it might be easy to dismiss Molloy and Berkeley International as a throwback to the days of submitting dating profiles via VHS cassette, the company has grown from one office in 2003 to a global network across 13 countries turning over £1m annually.\u0026nbspSo, there’s clearly a market for its services and, according to Molloy, it’s not the preserve of “the twin pearls set” with clients on her books as young as 22 and as mature as 88 years old. They are a mix of entrepreneurs, inherited wealth, self-starters and celebrities.\u0026nbspA demanding clientele for sure but one that Mairead seems to revel in managing.Growing up in County Wexford in Ireland, she studied hotel management before setting up and ultimately selling a software company before, on a whim, buying a hotel in Cannes, where she still lives. That venture lasted four and half years before she once again sold up and accepted the role of global director at a fledgling Berkeley International.What’s it like to work as a matchmaker?It was while setting up Berkeley International that she took a degree in psychology and a masters in criminology, redefining herself as a relationship psychologist along the way.\u0026nbspIt’s not clear whether she is a natural people person, or if the psychology training has given her the skills, but she is able to disarm and engage the person in front of her effortlessly. She is a jumble of relaxed and intense, measured and flippant, confident and vulnerable. It’s an unusual mix, but it seems to work with a demanding client base.\u0026nbspShe happily concedes that the scope for complaint in her line of work is 100 per cent, which is why she believes that the one-on-one interaction her agency provides is so important. “When someone comes in, you have to paint an absolutely honest version of reality. All we can do is give you advice, introduce you to the best possible people that we can and, by process of elimination, and through your feedback, try and pinpoint the best person for you.”\u0026nbspWhich sounds straightforward enough but when people have shelled out tens of thousands of pounds and not met their match, they tend to turn to the supplier for recompense.This business is all about humour and personality and being able to laugh at yourself – if you can do that, you’re going to meet someoneA 2018 court case involving premium dating agency\u0026nbspSeventy Thirty\u0026nbspshows just how wrong it can go. The agency was ordered by the courts to refund Tereza Burki’s £13,000 membership fee after she was unable to find a suitable match through their services. Ms Burki was in turn told to pay Seventy Thirty £5,000 in libel damages for posting an online review describing the company a scam. All very messy and undignified. So how does Molly ensure that Berkeley does not find itself dragged into a similarly unseemly situation?“I don’t think the ruling against Seventy Thirty was justified – I think it was brutally unfair,” she says.\u0026nbsp“These people come into introduction agencies and pay money and they have this idea in their head that they are going to meet their prince or princess charming – they are deluded.“What you should do is come in with an open mind and treat the people who are looking after you with respect and accept the dates that are arranged based on the criteria you have provided. This business is all about humour and personality and being able to laugh at yourself – if you can do that, you’re going to meet someone.”She says that over the last 16 years, Berkeley has had about 5,000 people on its books and that the success rate, defined as a relationship lasting longer than six months, is high, depending on the age group.\u0026nbsp“If you are between 22-38, the success rate can be as high as 70 per cent. That success rate decreases the older you get but once people go beyond the childbearing years, it goes back up. For older people it is really high, about 80 per cent, but they’re more willing to accept reality.”Man sues elite matchmaker after spending $426,000 on six datesBerkeley has three options for the lovelorn – membership that provides access to the UK client base, an equivalent that broadens the search across Europe and further afield, and a bespoke service where matches are “headhunted” on behalf of a client.\u0026nbspTravelling around the world, headhunting that elusive inidual to complete the life of a wealthy inidual (“never an English person, always European or international and generally a man in his early 50s or woman in her mid-to late 30s”), must mean Molloy has had to leave her Wexford roots behind and join a global elite.“I live in a simple world,” she insists.\u0026nbsp“I don’t live in a fancy house or drive a fancy car. I like a fried egg sandwich, watching Coronation Street on the phone to my mother. The world of wealth and fame doesn’t bother me. It’s not me, it’s what I do.”\u0026nbspThis is reflected in her desires for the future. Aside from desperately wanting to appear on the Graham Norton Show, “I just want to go to India and not give a sh*t about anything.” She quickly admits that she couldn’t do that forever. She needs to be doing something.\u0026nbspAnd for now, that something is continuing to kick against the transactional approach to dating that chafes so much and bring romance, personality and love back to the world of dating.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed.

That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And you’d have this incredible shot of green plants against a red background,” he said.SpaceX could land on the moon by 2021, Elon Musk claims (SpaceX)“My goal was simply to get the public excited, which would then get Congress excited so that they would appropriate more money and increase Nasa’s budget.”With the increasing success of SpaceX, Mr Musk has since extended his ambitions for the firm. He believes that with innovations like reusable rockets, SpaceX can help humanity eventually become a multi-planet\u0026nbspspecies, with the eventual goal of saving our species from extinction.The SpaceX\u0026nbspand Tesla boss is known for his overly-ambitious timelines, though has also made a habit of eventually delivering on promises.Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspown estimates for returning to the moon are also ambitious, though slightly more conservative.

Now, the\u0026nbspspace agency is looking to put the first woman\u0026nbspand the next man on the lunar surface in 2024.“Being able to write that next chapter, knowing what has come before through Apollo and the shuttle programme, and knowing we are writing that next story is amazing.\u0026nbspIt is humbling to think about what they were able to do... especially considering they didn’t have the computing power we do,” she says. “That we are even in the same conversation... is incredible.”Spellman should know what the Apollo missions took, she works with veterans of that programme and while Nasa has had to build on that expertise over the past five decades the principles of that era-defining trip underpin\u0026nbspeverything she does.\u0026nbspThe current mission, called Artemis,\u0026nbspthe sister of Apollo, is daunting in itself. Having been set the task of returning to the moon in 2028, Donald Trump’s administration has\u0026nbspaccelerated that timeline. Vice-president Mike Pence said back in March that the later deadline was “just not good enough” and that “urgency must be our watch word”.While that may have something to do with that date being\u0026nbspthe end of a notional second term for Trump, the non-partisan Nasa is taking it in its stride.\u0026nbsp“It gets me really excited. I’m\u0026nbspexcited that we now have this really clear goal of boots on the moon by 2024...

A veteran of the 1960s effort, Poimboeuf said earlier this month: “This place is history in the making and it’s not over yet.”“It is not going to happen overnight... but it is comforting to know we are going through some of the same growing pains,” she adds.NasaEPA)Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy space centre in Florida has seen its fair share of history beyond Apollo, having also been used in the space shuttle programme from 1981 to 2011 – but its latest guise is unprecedented. It will now accommodate Nasa’s heavy-duty Space Launch System (SLS), which will power the crew-carrying Orion capsule into the heavens.\u0026nbspAs an example of the sheer magnitude of the changes, more than 1.3 million feet of copper\u0026nbspwiring used in the Apollo era has\u0026nbsphad to be switched to fibre optics.\u0026nbsp“It is a pivotal time for us – we are now testing the mobile launchpad and the launcher together so we are building up the system... we are getting really close to that first mission.” An unmanned test flight of Orion is due next year, with a crewed test to follow in 2022.What happened as astronauts headed towards the MoonApollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketEverything you need to know about the Apollo 11 Moon landingLast remaining moon landing video tapes up for auctionBeyond Florida and the Nasa centres across the US, the elements around the mission are fraught. Some members of congress, who have to sign off the budget for Artemis, are wary of the costs and the few details provided so far.\u0026nbsp“We have a White House directive to land humans on the Moon in five years, but no plan, and no budget details on how to do so,” Kendra Horn,\u0026nbspchair of the House subcommittee on space and aeronautics, said back in May just before a 2020 budget was announced. That budget called for an extra $1.6bn\u0026nbspto fund Artemis for that fiscal year, on top of the $21bn\u0026nbspthe president already requested for Nasa.Costs for the following years are yet to be established but will rise, with estimates that Artemis could cost $20bn\u0026nbspto $30bn or more in total.\u0026nbsp“You are sort of asking congress to put a down payment on a car, but you don’t know what you are buying and you don’t know how much it will cost,” says Dr Mary Lynne Dittmar, who has decades of experience in the space field and is part of the Users’ Advisory Group of the National Space Council – the body reestablished by Trump under the direction of\u0026nbspPence to help guide policy.Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine\u0026nbsptold a Senate panel\u0026nbspon Wednesday that a budget impasse and subsequent spending freeze later this year would be devastating for the chances of the Artemis mission.However,\u0026nbspwith the mission looking to set down roots for “national capability for decades” rather than just two or three trips to the moon,\u0026nbspDittmar believes it is a “different ball game” to the “war footing” of the 1960s space race. Later space missions in the 1970s and 1980s were “trying to apply a model that was specific to that one point in time... now it is a much different landscape”. More infrastructure and more countries are involved – which means the conversations over how missions will take place and what is needed will take longer.Dittmar does not doubt the political will to put humans back on the moon, but the pressure of the deadline means that things have to happen relatively quickly. Recent staff changes at the top of Nasa, initiated by those within the agency, may indicate that the urgency created by the White House is having an effect.In his speech in March, Pence raised the prospect of the use of commercial rockets to keep the mission on schedule. “If commercial rockets are the only way to get American astronauts to the moon in the next five years, then commercial rockets it will be,” he said. There are certainly advocates who believe this is the right strategy and it could reduce costs.\u0026nbspCharles Miller, who was part of the Trump administration’s transition team for Nasa in 2017 and was senior adviser for commercial space at Nasa from 2009 to 2012, believes that such partnerships between Nasa and outside companies are “fundamental”.\u0026nbsp“Artemis is an opportunity to have a complete break with the failed space policies of the last couple of decades... to open up the solar system in a way that is completely affordable and could be transformational,” he says.Why some people still believe that we never went to the Moon“If we go back to the moon in the way Trump wants and the way Obama did before him, by leveraging commercial partnerships, it can also be much faster and be of much more benefit to the world,” he adds. Miller, who is a serial space entrepreneur, says that if billionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are putting up capital and so “have skin in the game” it is a win-win, even if there have been some failures in the past.I think the overall strategy the Nasa administration wants to execute will succeed, the only question is when... The old model of the ‘big costs and aerospace needs’ is on the verge of collapse,” he says.Dittmar, who is also chief executive\u0026nbspfor the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, a trade group of more than 65 companies, sees things differently. She believes the space market needs to be at a tipping point where investors and company shareholders see the potential for returns and we might not be there yet.\u0026nbsp“I think public-private partnerships have a place, yes. Do I think it is a panacea? No,” she says,\u0026nbspalthough it is more likely the market may be in shape by the time Nasa is looking at heading to Mars once the Artemis mission is complete.\u0026nbspFor Dittmar, who was involved with work on the International Space Station (ISS), the implications of the Artemis mission are beyond business or even the limited scope that the Trump White House is projecting.\u0026nbspShe is looking for American leadership in space and being able to “keep the door open for others”. More than 100 countries have been involved in the various facets of the ISS mission both on the ground and in space and such cooperation will be crucial to make the most of the moon mission and beyond.Nasa\u0027s next great mission to the moonDittmar remembers the 1969 landing and says that it represents “one of the shining moments in humanity on par with figuring out the Magna Carta”. But the full impact may not be felt for generations and it is the same with the new mission.\u0026nbsp“I do believe that other nations are going to be watching and thinking ‘what does this mean for us?’” she says. “Inspiration is not just public inspiration its inspiration in engineering, in technology development.”“We are also going to learn about ourselves as human beings – being challenged by new environments,” Dittmar adds.Inspiration for the next generation is a key motive for Spellman, who has a young son.\u0026nbsp“We want this reality of working in maths and science to hit kids all over the world,” she says. “Now there is so much access to what we are doing – can you imagine the live feed coming from the moon and kids watching that? It will put it at the fingertips of children across the world and make it real to them that they could do something like this.”In fact, Spellman hopes the Artemis mission will provide a cultural touchstone for everyone.\u0026nbsp“I hope the mission brings us all together, for at least\u0026nbspa moment,” she says. When you think about everyone sitting around watching their televisions or listening on the radio when Neil Armstrong was taking the steps on the moon, it would be great to have that moment again.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027ll also be the first\u0026nbspfilm to\u0026nbspdelve into the multiverse, which was most recently\u0026nbspaddressed\u0026nbspin Spider-Man: Far From Home.While no official word was given on future Avengers projects, it certainly seems that Marvel is lining a Young Avengers film for its fifth or even sixth phase. Why? Well, because the character of Kate Bishop will appear in Hawkeye\u0027s standalone TV show. Comic book readers will know bishop to be a character most associated with a group of younger superheroes who is guided by Hawkeye.\u0026nbspNatalie Portman to become goddess of thunderThe most exciting news of the panel came with the announcement that Natalie Portman will be promoted from being Thor\u0027s love interest to becoming the goddess of thunder in Taika Waititi\u0027s sequel Thor: Love and Thunder. The actor posed for photographs holding Thor\u0027s hammer in the air.Fantastic Four and X-Men are joining the MCUFollowing the many announcements, Marvel boss Kevin Feige teased projects that will be released beyond 2020, also.

We didn’t have time to talk about Captain Marvel 2. Then things got interesting as Feige added: “I didn’t even have time to talk about the Fantastic Four. And there’s no time left to talk about mutants and how mutants come into the MCU.”This was all but confirmation that plans to introduce X-Men\u0026nbspinto the MCU are indeed underway.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed.

That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This\u0026nbspsuggests\u0026nbspremediation efforts have stalled.More than 50,000 people are estimated to still be living in buildings that have been deemed as unsafe.The latest revelation came after the government admitted that the scale of the cladding crisis is much bigger than first thought.It had long been known that ACM panels were unsafe for use on highrise buildings, but on Thursday ministers announced that a second type of cladding had also been found to be highly flammable.It is not known how many blocks are covered in the second type of panel, called high-pressure laminate (HPL), but hundreds more buildings are likely to be affected.Advice issued by the government\u0026nbspsaid that “action to remediate unsafe HPL systems should be carried out as soon as possible”.Created with Sketch.Grenfell fire remembered two years on: In pictures Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Campaign group Grenfell United project a message

anniversary of the Grenfell fire Further suspect types of cladding have yet to be tested, suggesting the problem could be greater still.Ministers announced this week that they wanted to see ACM cladding removed from all social sector buildings by December 2019 and all private sector buildings by June 2020.Currently just 1.25 private sector residential blocks on average are having ACM cladding removed each month, compared to an average of 3.5 for social sector blocks.This suggests that, at the current rate, the social sector work will only be completed in December 2021, and the private sector work not until May 2030.Facing pressure to do more to speed up the removal of dangerous materials, the government announced a £200m fund earlier this year to help private building owners remove ACM cladding, but critics said the money would not go far enough.As well as setting the new targets, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, has said the government is considering punishing private block owners who are still refusing to take the cladding down after the end of this year.Labour said private blocks should be “confiscated” if owners refuse to comply and called on the government to do more to support owners who are struggling to cover the costs of removing the materials.Grenfell victimsSarah Jones, the party’s shadow housing minister, said: “The government has at long last set a deadline to remove ACM cladding, but at the current pace of work they will miss that target by a whole decade.“Ministers need to step in and help councils who are struggling to get this work done promptly. And they must clarify what enforcement action they will take against private block owners who fail to make their buildings safe. Labour has been clear that sanctions should include confiscation of blocks where necessary.“We now know that ACM is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the cladding scandal. Now the government has admitted HPL cladding is deadly, we urgently need answers on how many more buildings are covered in flammable materials and how quickly it will be removed.”Health chiefs ‘showed troubling lack of urgency over Grenfell cough’ Huge crowd marches in silence on second anniversary of Grenfell blazeSafety fears at scorched Barking flats ‘first raised after Grenfell’Matt Wrack,\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the FBU, said:\u0026nbsp“The glacial speed of progress removing the very same flammable cladding as was on Grenfell Tower is simply shameful. To see so little progress removing dangerous cladding over the last month sums up the government’s half-hearted approach to public safety.“Despite the government’s own tests proving that high-pressure laminate cladding is not safe, they have made no commitment to remediation work. It’s as though they are waiting to see another tragic loss of life before they will protect the thousands at risk from other forms of flammable cladding.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We expect all building owners, unless there are exceptional circumstances, to complete remediation within six months of agreeing a plan – by June 2020 – or they will face enforcement action.“Owners are responsible for the safety of their buildings and it’s unacceptable if they are not moving quickly to remedy this problem – which is why the government has made £600m\u0026nbspavailable to pay for remediation and remove cost as a barrier to progress.“Ensuring the safety of residents still living in buildings with unsafe ACM cladding is a priority.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In April, there were just four – despite a government estimate of 10,500 rogue landlords operating across England.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 49Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Artist Steve Messam poses next to his monumental landscape artwork \u0027Hush\u0027 which hangs in the moors of Teesdale on July 18, 2019 in Barnard Castle, England.

I think people are beginning to understand it is important: if you are not sustainable in the future – I mean either as a community or business – you will not survive.”ReTuna, it is worth making clear, remains a relatively small-scale experiment.There are just 12 shops\u0026nbsphere, while visitor numbers have stayed stubbornly plateaued at about 255,000 a year since it first opened in August 2015. Total sales are good – some £2.8m worth of goods have been bought since day one – but still fall slightly short of what was hoped for. A plan to expand the centre to more than 5,000 square metres remains on hold until those figures pick up.“It’s a difficult retail environment competing against the convenience of online, and we feel that as much as any other mall,” says Anna.All the same, visiting ReTuna is undoubtedly an experience.Set opposite a nature reserve in a repurposed DHL building 10 minutes from Eskilstuna’s town centre, its high sliding doors reveal an inside that is all glass, polished concrete and exposed industrial piping. An art installation\u0026nbspand communal seating (all made of repurposed materials, of course) welcome visitors, while a glass roof and mezzanine upper floor mean\u0026nbspnatural light floods through the mall. Perfume fills the air. The café does a mean baked potato with salad.“People in Sweden love the idea of sustainability, but they sometimes associate second-hand shopping with flea markets,” says Anna, who has more than 15 years’ experience managing shopping centres. “We wanted to get as far from that image as possible. This is about making pre-loved high-end and desirable.”She mentions the Mall of Scandinavia, a 171-store, 42-restaurant megaplex, which opened an hour away in Stockholm just three months after ReTuna.“But I think we’re the real Mall of Scandinavia,” the mother-of-four says. “That’s just a big version of any other shopping centre in the world. This is an attempt to show the world a new way.”Spenders here today, it seems, agree.One I speak to, Drew Nissen, is an American tourist who has popped in while visiting family in the area.“It’s an incredible place,” the 33-year-old photographer from Atlanta says. “It’s all so visually enticing. It makes you want to spend money. I’d love to see something like it in the States. Second-hand shops there are so depressing. Change that image, emphasise the green credentials, and I think you have a success story waiting to happen.”Logistically, ReTuna – named because the town’s nickname is Tuna – is an ode to Swedish efficiency.Based next door to one of two municipal recycling centres, townsfolk are encouraged to sort and dispose of their rubbish at that facility before bringing items which might be resold or reused to a drop-off point at the back of the mall.There, in a vast warehouse space, a specialist team sorts these donated goods so that the centre’s shop owners – who all run their stores as independent businesses – can come along and choose what they can fix, convert, refine and, ultimately, put up for sale.“So, all these items are given a new lease of life,” explains Anna, as we walk through this backstage storage space, a veritable Santa’s grotto of indoor and outdoor furniture, electronics, clothes, games, pictures, plant pots, lamps, lights, books, bags, crockery and pottery.Some items here are all but antiques – there’s a stunning Seventies record player nestled next to a Nineties Sega Mega Drive – but others are, quite literally, brand new. I see a mirror still in original packaging and point it out. “I’m afraid some Swedes do have a habit of throwing out very quickly,” winces Anna. “We’ll get TVs from the last year. Laptops also. Or settees that just need a reupholster. But this is good for our shops because it means they get a reputation for stocking high-quality goods.”Why don’t people sell such stuff online instead of donating it here, I ask?\u0026nbsp“Some will, of course,” says Anna. “But giving it to the centre like this is good for the community. It keeps money here, helps local people and businesses, boosts our economy. And what is good for a community is, in the end, good for the inidual too. This is what we say.”Perhaps the best items received so far has been a brooch dating back to 1848. “This we have not put on sale yet,” says Anna. “We think we will get it valued first.”The whole idea was the brainchild of a local Green Party councillor back in the early Noughties. “Perhaps he was what you call a hippy,” says Anna. “But he was a hippy\u0026nbspwho was very good at lobbying, and he made the municipality see the value of this, both as a waste management strategy and a commercial enterprise.”Plans for the mall and next door’s recycling centre became a flagship strand in a raft of environmentally friendly proposals – including running local buses on biogas and giving residents seven different bins – designed to make the former steel town’s economy one of the greenest in Sweden.The idea was then rubber-stamped in 2012 and the building converted with a £1.6m subsidy from the council, which is led by the country’s Social Democrats. Three aims were identified and remain key today: increasing local sustainability, job creation (a dozen people work here, along with roughly 30 shop owners and staff), and offering environmental education.That latter one is fulfilled by an onsite classroom and conference facilities. An oil company was one recent organisation to hire both out for a senior staff awayday. “Kind of ironic,” nods Anna.She\u0026nbspherself\u0026nbspcame on board as manager just before opening.To take what she says is her dream job, she rented a flat in the town, while her family continue to live 50 miles away in Nyköping. “Almost my whole apartment is furnished with things I bought from the mall,” she says. “I love it. My only problem is making sure I don’t spend all my wages here.”Shop owners are just as enthusiastic about the project – although keen to emphasise it has not been easy to establish their stores.Eva Meden quit a high-flying job as a prison boss to set up ReModa, a chic homeware store, with sister Anita Patterssun.“Which was harder work?” the 55-year-old ponders, stood among candles, cake stands and teacups. “I think dealing with prisoners is easy compared to running your own business. But this is so rewarding. You take things, you are creative, fix them up, try and improve them, then sell them on. This is a lovely way to make a living.”Their sales curve, the pair say, is on the “right trajectory”: they moved into a bigger unit in April after more than two years here. “I think some people in Sweden still need persuading that second-hand can be beautiful, but we say ‘Come to our shop and see’,” says 51-year-old Anita.A little way along the mezzanine floor is Amjad Al Chamaa, manager of Re:Compute:IT.Here, in a Steptoe’s Yard of electronics, he stocks everything from battered guitar amps and VHS video recorders (popular with people wanting to watch mum and dad’s old wedding footage, apparently) to state-of-the-art laptops and smart TVs. One, currently on sale at £1,200, is a 2018 Philips model.“Nice TV,” nods the 35-year-old. “Although the funny things is people come here looking for something as new as possible but they see the older stuff, see how great it looks and that it still works – things was built to last back then – and end up buying that instead.”He shrugs. “A Seventies TV – you don’t find this in a regular mall.”His shop, he adds, is especially popular with Eskilstuna’s 5,000-strong immigrant population. “I’m from Syria myself so I know this,” he says. “When you’re new to a place, you need bargains.”Bargains, indeed, are something ReTuna, as a whole, is hoping will keep attracting shoppers.Events such as a semi-regular Crazy Monday, when all prices are reduced, opening hours increased and entertainment put on, have attracted thousands through the doors.Yet more perhaps does still need to be done to prove this concept can become a long-term success.Back on the roof terrace with Anna, she reveals she is looking to have a supermarket onsite as an anchor tenant.“Obviously you can’t sell pre-loved food,” she smiles. “But there’s no reason you couldn’t strike a deal with Aldi, for instance, to have a supermarket here specialising in sustainable goods. For them, it is an experiment of something they might do more widely in the future. For us, it brings people onto\u0026nbspsite.”A salon and an ethical shoe shop are also tenants she is specifically aiming for next. “The key is to keep being imaginative and thinking big,” she says.Talking of which, I ask her about that possible speaking engagement for the International Council of Shopping Centers. Will she do it, I wonder?“Well, of course, it would mean speaking in English, which is not always easy,” she says in near-perfect English. “But I think it would be worthwhile. This is not just about ReTuna. It is about spreading this idea and this concept everywhere.”International Council of Shopping Centers\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have a good idea who it will be. But either way, we know their first priority will be looking after their rich friends and wealthy supporters. For the past four weeks the two contenders have been conducting an increasingly absurd debate about who will give another £ billion-plus tax break to the richest in society. They’re talking about a dferent country to the one I live in. Nine years of Tory and Lib Dem governments have left us one of the most ided in Europe. A short walk around almost any town or city should make that clear. Homeless people sleeping rough, begging for change to pay for their next meal, while the wealthiest drive by in expensive cars. Teachers stressed out, desperately trying to keep their school going without sufficient funds. Young people either unable to leave the parental home or paying exorbitant rents in the private rented sector, unable to save, feeling trapped. Parents worrying about their children’s future, while graduates start their working lives with debts of £,. The closed libraries, swimming pools and youth centres all tell their own story. This is the toxic legacy of Theresa May.  Under pressure, the Tory leadership candidates have acknowledged that schools, hospitals, social care and the police don’t have enough money – asthe last nine years in government had nothing to do with them. So the first test for the next Prime Minister must be to do what Theresa May promised, but failed to deliver: end austerity. But on the campaign trail the candidates have been more interested in trying to prove their virility by threatening a No Deal exit from the EU. That is reckless. No Deal would trash our industries – from car manufacturing to farming. It would raise food prices and cause medicine shortages in the NHS.  The reality is they want a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump as the basis of for our future trade. But the US administration’s priority is well known to all: it’s America First. When Theresa May invited Trump to dine with the Queen, he named his price: the opening up of our NHS for takeover by American corporations. So the second test for whoever becomes the next Prime Minister is: do they have the confidence to put No Deal, or any damaging Tory deal, to a public vote  The third test is whether they’re prepared to take the necessary action to tackle the climate emergency.  I know what Labour will do: we will kick start a Green Industrial Revolution to deliver new jobs in green industries that will help us halt the slide into climate breakdown. At the current rate of progress, this government’s pledge to get to net zero carbon emissions won’t be met until  – more than fty years too late. We cannot wait that long. The science is clear and indisputable – we need to reduce our emissions now and fast. Air pollution is right now killing , people a year in the UK. At a time of climate crisis, investment in renewables is actually falling. The Tories scrapped the solar feed-in tarf, virtually banned onshore wind, and they failed to invest in the Swansea tidal lagoon. Instead they back fracking – you really couldn’t make it up.

Robin, , who did not want to reveal his identity, said the stereotype of aposFlat Earthersapos being reclusive conspiracy theorists is a misconception.He wants to trigger a mass awakening but said he has concerns that being linked to the Flat Earth theory will cause problems for himself, his family and business. I worry very much that something might happen to me, he said.Robin, a grandfather, told Bristol Live he blames deep programming for brainwashing society into believing in a globe and ridiculing Flat Earthers.He runs a group of around  Flat Earthers in Bristol.    Flat Earthers have become more prevalent over recent years, thanks in part to a YouTube community. Conferences in America have been known to attract hundreds of people. He said: I first came across the subject when my daughter came home from work one day in . Someone at work had told her the Earth was flat. I chuckled and said, aposDonapost be silly. What about the photos of Earth from space apos My daughter shrugged and told me, aposIaposm just telling you what they saidapos. But Robin couldnapost rid himself of the idea, and began watching YouTube videos on the subject. I watched half a dozen videos, and the things I thought would stand up in my own mind soon fell apart, he said. It took me two weeks to get past my programming. It was pretty devastating. You realise you have been lied to. Robinaposs ultimate goal is to change the education system. At the moment, the shape of the planet is taught in a partisan way, which is a breach of the Education Act, he said. They should teach dferent theories with balance. Robin has images of what he believes is the Earthaposs wonderfully designed system - a flat surface under a dome which also contains a local sun and a local moon. According to his theory, the sun is not millions of miles away but just a few thousand, and a much smaller size than Earth.  He says this is supported by light appearing to be local when it shines through clouds.    He believes day and night are explained by the sun moving over dferent points of the Earth and leaving others dark - the sun moves but the Earth does not - and described gravity as a magical, mythical force while things fall simply because of buoyancy and density. Other theories include that NASA uses CGI and Photoshop to copy and paste clouds onto pictures of Earth from space, and footage of astronauts walking in space really shows them moving through water. He believes there are huge amounts of natural resources like gas, oil and uranium hidden in land beyond the perimeter of Antartica. Banking families or the powerbrokers control governments to perpetuate the myth of a globe, so they can access the resources without accountability.   I worry very much that something might happen to me, he said. But I have made myself visible in the community. If I suddenly vanished, it would be a bit obvious. Robin is careful about who he discusses the subject with.  I have a successful business, he said. I donapost want clients knowing about it. They might think aposhis headaposs in the cloudsapos.  I maybe test them to see how receptive they are with a slightly dferent subject like G or chemtrails.  However, he can often be found handing out Flat Earth leaflets and putting up banners in Broadmead.  He said: It is common for people to laugh. That is a programmed response. Iaposm not a bad salesman, but itaposs not always possible to persuade people. The programming is deep. He claims to have converted dozens of people through his activism, and his group of Flat Earthers meets each month at the Punchbowl pub in Old Market Street. Robin said: We get lots of dferent people. We had a young Cardf University student a couple of weeks ago. Some very intelligent people are into this.

Mum Rachel Carrieaposs kill list in the past year includes four deer,  ducks, about  pheasants and partridges and more than  wood pigeons. The -year-old, from Yorkshire, said she rarely makes trips to the meat counter because her family eats only what they hunt - her teenage son has been eating her kills since he was four. The game hunter - who has shot for Britain in the Commonwealth Games - said she is an animal lover, and claims vegetarians and vegans should see her as an ally.  The Daily Mirror has called for an end to the barbaric practice of trophy hunting in a campaign backed by politicians, celebrities and activists. It has also called for an end to canned hunting – confining wild animals on small reserves just so they can be shot dead for a price. But Rachel told The Sunday Times: “Vegetarians and vegans, shooters and hunters need to be educated. We are not the enemy. We have common ground.” She claimed vegetarians may unwittingly cause the displacement or killing of wildle, asking how much land occupied by wild game has been converted to grow crops, and how many animals have been killed by farmers protecting their fields.    The professional shooter said she was vegetarian between the ages of seven and  after discovering the realities of factory farming, and she held many of the same objections to meat. Rachel, now an environmental impact assessor, became conflicted when her father took her out to hunt rabbits with a Harris’s hawk. She was happy to eat an animal after seeing where it had lived in the wild.  Her view was also shaped by going out deer stalking, saying: You place a clean shot straight through the heart and that animal never knew you were there. It didn’t suffer, it wasn’t scared. It didn’t get transported miles and miles to an abattoir.” Hunting is the most ethical option, she argued, and it allows her to eat meat without the guilt.  She will present her argument in a debate at The Game Fair, the UKaposs biggest gathering of hunters and shooters, next Sunday in Hatfield House, Hertfordshire. Rachel said she hunts game with the consent of farmers and other landowners. Her Instagram page is filled with photos of her carrying a shotgun on hunts, plucking feathers from dead birds in her kitchen, and butchering her kills.  One photo shows her holding a deeraposs heart in her blood-covered hand after cutting the organ out of the animal. She wrote in the caption: I feel itaposs important to show this - people often ask aposwhat do you feel immediately after you pull the triggerapos remorse  Joy  Thrill  For me none of those - I feel concern, obligation and responsibility. Iaposm concerned until I can be absolutely certain the shot placement is good, the end quick, clean and the animal has not suffered and itaposs my obligation and responsibility to this animal to immediately follow up a shot.

The Duchess of Sussex has been watching the game being played from the windows of Frogmore Cottage , and even made a visit to the Royal Household Bowling Club next door to her home to speak to players.According to The Sunday Express, one observer said Meghan stopped to talk to two female players and told them she had been watching from her upstairs window. One source said: Meghan remarked to the two players how elegant the game looked.  Meghan is far from the only royal admirer of the game. Six years ago, the Queen was a surprise spectator when the royal club played the Brimfield and Little Hereford Bowling Club. She told players she had been watching The Ashes on television but decided she needed some air and had spotted the game from her Land Rover. She spent half an hour watching and posed for photographs with players, with one spectator saying she gave a fist pump when informed Englandaposs cricketers had won the game. At the time, Brimfield player David Evans said: It was a total surprise to the team. She told us she had taken some fresh air and askedit was OK for her to watch the game. She watched us play for around  minutes in all, there was quite a lot of pressure on us to perform in front of her. It is an amazing coincidence she turned up, I heard she has only been to the bowls green around four times in the last  years. Princess Diana was also a fan of bowls, and was photographed several times playing the game, including on a tour of Indonesia in . She also opened indoor bowl centres in Charnwood and Luton. Tony Allcock, , chief executive of Bowls England, said his organisationaposs , members will be very excitedMeghan takes up the game. Itaposs fair to say that predominantly our members are of an older level, who find the game a wonderful way to keep fit and active and a way to keep being involved in local communities. But we do encourage all ages, and we are finding that those in their s and s are attracted to the sport, which has no barriers and now has a relaxed dress code - shorts are encouraged in the summer. We have made huge strides in the game in recent years, and having someone of the duuchessaposs profile being interested would be a marvellous way to encourage those of younger generations to try bowls. They would find it tremendously rewarding.

Although she was told by doctors she had just months to live and would miscarryshe attempted to get pregnant again, Helen decided to stick two fingers up to that.    Last year, cleaner Helen was given the amazing news that her cancer was no longer growing, and the couple were searching for a surrogate mother when Helen woke up one morning and said she just knew she was pregnant.  In a bizarre twist of fate, the scar tissue from her cancer made her cervix stronger and helped support the pregnancy. The happy couple have now welcomed perfect baby son Harvey George, who was allowed home this week after being born early via an emergency caesarean section, weighing just lb oz. Helen said: It was really strange. One day I woke up and I said aposI feel really pregnantapos. I was scared, excited and nervous at the same time.

They didnapost even expect me to last this long. In , they gave me months. I was really nervous until I reached  weeks. The doctors saidI reached  weeks, they would be happy because of the success rates. I was hoping for a boy. Iaposve got two girls and the thought of raising him and watching him grow has given us something to look forward to. Especially because of what my girls missed out on when I was ill. Heaposs made the family complete.  We were determined to have another child, thataposs why we were looking for a surrogate. I wanted to give Paul a son because he didnapost have any of his own.

Phillip Herron, , was trying to feed and clothe his family while out of work, falling behind with rent and trying to repay £, debts — including payday loans of over , per cent interest. He applied for government help but the month-long wait for Universal Credit drove him deeper into debt. “That was the final nail in his coffin,” said his grieving mum Sheena Derbyshire, . Phillip’s final act as he sat in his car on a quiet country lane on March  was to upload a picture of himself crying to social media. Minutes later he was dead. Have you got a story about struggling with Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  “In his suicide note he said his family would be better offhe wasn’t there any more,” Sheena added. “He was a single dad. He was responsible. He always had money before and the kids had the best of everything. “But Phillip had quit his job as a factory worker recently to look after his young kids and he got in to debt, which must have been dficult for him. “To suddenly have no money for them must have been very hard. He was waiting for Universal Credit and had just £. when he died. “When people turn to the Government for help they’re already desperate. To make them wait so long for payments is dangerous. “There’s no reason it should take so long. Phillip already had problems but I think this was the final straw.” Universal Credit – brought in by the Coalition Government  and rolled out nationwide since – was meant to replace a series of benefits with just one. But it is paid monthly in arrears, meaning an average wait of five weeks for the first payment. Labour claims the delay drives families into debt, poverty and eviction and aims to reform it.  Like many people, Phillip Herron was deeply in debt when, without telling his family, he applied for Universal Credit. “His death came as a complete shock,” Sheena said. “I couldn’t understand why he’d do this.” It was only later that Sheena pieced together what had happened. Papers in his home showed he owed around £, to banks, utility firms and payday lenders with, Sheena said, “, per cent interest rates”. She also found an eviction notice sent to him by the Bernicia Homes housing association. And she discovered from his children that things got so bad at Christmas “Santa had not come”. But worse was to come when, after weeks of trying, she worked out the code to unlock his phone. Mum-of-six Sheena trawled through emails and listened to months of calls he had recorded. “I was trying to knit his le together,” she said. “You could hear him changing so much over those final months. “He used to be very quietly spoken but in his recent calls and messages he was often screaming. “He loved his kids but he started shouting at them. And you can hear him sobbing in calls. I heard him talking about suicide to other people. “I wish he’d told us how he was feeling but we never knew. “Listening to those last few months of calls I started asking myself, ‘Who is this person ’ He’d changed so much so very quickly. “If we didn’t have his phone and his computer we wouldn’t have known what had been going on for him. It was like walking back­wards through his le. It’s the most heart-wrenching thing I’ve ever done.” Sheena has been haunted by guilt since Phillip’s death. “I’ll never be OK,” she said. “There’s not a second in the day I don’t miss him. “Every morning I wake up and wish I didn’t have to face another day without him, but I keep going for the kids. “His youngest daughter is totally lost. She misses her dad so much. “She had a dream the other night that he came to her. She said, ‘I asked him not to leave again. But when I woke up he wasn’t there’. “They haven’t even been offered counselling,” Sheena added.  The system failed Phillip – now it’s failing his ex-partner and their ­children too.” Sheena hopes the evidence she found will be used at a full inquest into Phillip’s death, at Sacriston, Co Durham, and expose the failings of Universal Credit. She believes talking about his suicide and its impact on his family can help others too. Sheena said: “You don’t just go out one day and take your own le. There’s a build-up. “So please, please talk to someone. Don’t let another family go through this. If you can’t talk to family or friends, there are people like Samaritans.” Last night a Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “Our thoughts are with Mr Herron’s family. “Suicide is a very complex issue, so it would be wrong to link it solely to someone’s benefit claim. “We are committed to safeguarding vulnerable claimants and keep guidance under constant review to provide the highest standard of protection.” A Bernicia spokesperson said when tenants face dficulties “our approach is to seek to work with them to help overcome these. “A small number of cases could ultimately end in residents losing their home but this is a long process and we see this as a last resort. “Help and support is available at every stage.

But Catherine Marray, , said the front door was propped open with a weight off a dumbbell when she arrived, there was a lumpy old mattress in her room and the communal toilets didnapost have door locks.She told the Liverpool Echo the owner asked her to make her own bed because he was busy, a bag of bread was hanging from the ceiling, and the room was described as the best in the house.A chopping board and a piece of wood hammered to the front of the property indicated the house number.    Admin worker Catherine paid £ for two nights for a girlsapos weekend with her friend, Deborah, from Oxford. She claims she didnapost notice the beachfront description until the day she checked in on July , and she just assumed it was a mistake.The propertyaposs Booking page lists the propertyaposs address A Google Maps search brings up the true location across from the back wall of an Aldi and next to a small deli and market.

Catherine lives in a dferent part of Liverpool, and booked the room because the location was convenient for the girlsapos weekend. She said: I got there for about .pm and the door was propped open with a weight off a dumbbell.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt. There was someone in there who said aposI will go and get the guy for youapos so this guy comes down covered in paint and said he was doing some plastering. He said it would be about half an hour. He seemed alright, he was chatty. My and my friend went to the pub and went back at .pm. She knew it wouldnapost be fancy, but she expected something basic.  She added: I donapost mind somewhere thataposs ey as long as itaposs clean because we were going to be out all day. We were shown into our room and found ripped curtains, a lumpy old mattress, a lamp that flickered on and off. The owner then passed me a single quilt cover and asked me to strip it for him as he was busy. He left another single quilt and bedding outside our room so we had to make our own bed.  Catherine and her friend decided to grin and bare it. She said: We were like aposletaposs just power through and we can go outapos. The room had ripped black pieces of material for curtains and lamp shades that were upside down, she said.  The two bathrooms didnapost have door locks, and in one the sink was covered in bleach with a toilet seat snapped in half. Catherine said the property was like a shabby student house. She and her friend went back to her home to have a shower. She claims the property reeked of cannabis on the second night, and added: In our room I gather where the smoke detector was, there was a bag of bread tied to the ceiling. I wish I could say I was making it up.  We were in stitches becauseI didnapost laugh I would have cried. Catherine claims other guests complained to the owner, with one asking him: Is this a joke  A Booking spokesperson said Catherine was given a full refund and the travel firm has been in touch with the owner to correct the listing. It no longer refers to it as a beachfront property.

Diane Beasley had no idea her loving husband John Smith, from Medina, Ohio, was being tracked by FBI officers, who feared she could be his next vicitim. When officers broke the news to Diane she failed to believe them - until John went on the run. To her John had just been unlucky in love, after he told her his first marriage ended in orce, and his second we died of cancer. But the truth was John had murdered and dismembered his first we - and was suspected of killing his second we.The horrying tale is featured in a new documentary to be aired on Crime and Investigation tomorrow night.Diane tells the show that when she first met John he could not have been more ordinary. He was slightly socially awkward but pretty unremarkable.    They married in  and she says she had seen aposnothing but love for herapos in her husbandaposs eyes. Recalling their first meeting, she said: “I was not looking for another relationship at all. I had been orced for three years and I was comfortable with occasionally dating. “He was really sweet, really nice, very polite. He seemed like the perfect gentleman.” John told Diane about his first two wives - his childhood sweetheart Janice Hartman, who orced him, and then a work colleague Betty aposFranapos Gladden, who he said tragically died of cancer. She recalls: “He told me he was at her bedside when she passed away so I felt for him.  But tragically Fran was actually missing - and still no trace of her has been found. Aged , John married dancer Janice in  and the pair seemed to the outside world to have the perfect marriage. However, behind closed doors John was jealous and volatile, leading Janice to file for orce four years later when a fight turned physical. On November   - three days after the orce was finalised - Janice went missing. John filed Janice as a missing person but police were unable to find any leads and the investigation was stopped. With no one watching him he hid her body in a makesht wooden box in his parentsapos home.  Her body was found in  by Johnaposs brother Michael Smith prompting John to dump the box by a roadside in Indiana. Police then discovered Janiceaposs remains but were unable to identy them as her until  during which time she was only known as the Lady in the Box. A year after Janiceaposs death, John moved to Florida and met Fran ten years his senior while working at the same software company. The couple then moved to New Jersey and got married in , but again things quickly turned sour and Johnaposs true nature was revealed. After being married for a year Fran slipped on some tiles and was left bed-bound. One month later, she disappeared.  With two wives now missing, police grew suspicious of John and launched an investigation. However, with no evidence it was shelved. When a police officer who worked on Franaposs case became an FBI agent a few years later, he decided to investigate again - and discovered similarities between the two incidents. Their break came when he was caught for an unrelated traffic violation in , which led them to discover he had relocated to Calornia and married Diane. After carrying out surveillance on John to gather evidence, they made contact with Diane and told her they suspected her husband was a killer and were worried for her safety - especially as John had been seeing another woman. Diane said: “I was in total, total shock. I could not believe that they were telling me all of this about John Smith.    Because I did not see anything but love for me through John’s eyes.” But when he went on the run she finally believed the FBI and started orce proceedings. John was enraged after receiving the papers and came out of hiding to furiously confront Diane in her home. She said: “He came up the stairs like two at a time and he had this look on his face like you’ve – I mean it wasn’t a mad person, it wasn’t an angry person. It was a devil person. But she said suddenly she noticed his demeanour completely change when he saw her daughter Summer was also at home.  She said: He looked at me and he said, aposWhy are you doing this to me baby  Let’s talk. I want to talk to youapos. She said she told him the police were on their way and he then fled. As the FBI had been monitoring the home they were lying in wait and arrested him. Police were able to snare him after DNA testing linked the Lady in the Box remains to Janice. Michael also testied that his brother had been acting very strangely after her death and had claimed he had kept her aposbelongingsapos in a box.

on the night and - on aggregate.Dons boss McInnes hailed the composure and calmness of his teenage midfielders Campbell, , and Lewis Ferguson, . And Aberdonian Campbell was thrilled to mark his first start in Europe with a win.He said: “It is a dream come true to play in a European competition and to play my part in a win in my first start which takes us through to the next round is fantastic.“I really appreciate the gaffer’s trust in me by putting me into a game like that.“It’s down to me after that to prove why he shows the faith in me and as long as he keeps doing that I have to keep working hard and do as best as I can when I get the opportunity.”Campbell was given the chance to play due to Craig Bryson missing the first round with an ankle injury.With Bryson due to resume training on Sunday and new signing Funso Ojo also joining the squad for next week’s second qualying round tie at Chikhura Sachkhere of Georgia, Campbell faces a fight to keep his place in the side. But he will use team-mate Ferguson’s success in holding down a regular place in the team as inspiration.]He said: “I’m comfortable in this team and feel I can cope with first-team games and European games. I just have to keep working as hard as I can and the manager will keep his faith in me.“Fergie had a terric season last year and will only kick on. He’s a fantastic young player and I enjoy playing alongside him so hopefully this is a partnership which we can develop.”Campbell, a product of the club’s youth system, has grown up watching the first team try to reach the group stages of the competition. This campaign, the sixth in a row under manager Derek McInnes, represents as good an opportunity as any.The importance for the club and the team in making it to the group stages has not been lost on the teenager.Huge clubs such as Premier League Arsenal and Manchester United as well as Italian side Roma lie in wait.The Aberdonian, a lelong Dons fan, is living his dream in being involved in European competition with his home city side.He said: “It’s always been an ambition, even as a little kid, to play in a European competition.“To get my first start is brilliant.I’ve watched the Real Sociedad games, the Groningen games as a fan so to be part of it is great.“All Aberdeen fans know of the glory days against Real Madrid and Bayern Munich but times have changed due to the money in the game now.“We’ve just got to do all we can to get to the group stages and that starts with the next round in Georgia.“It would be absolutely brilliant to get there.“That’s our aim every time we go into this competition and to get through would be fantastic for the players and financially for the club. It’s huge. I want to test myself against the best competition that is out there.“European competition is the cream at the top of the game.”The last time Aberdeen played in the group stages was during Jimmy Calderwood’s reign. The Dons reached the last  of the Uefa Cup in  before being eliminated - on aggregate by German giants Bayern Munich.Campbell was still at primary school during that run but the memories remain vivid today.He said: “I was a season ticket in the South Stand. I used to sit next to the away fans and I loved it. I was at the Bayern game in  and I remember that one and the Copenhagen game.“I would have been seven years old watching games like that so it’s great to be here  years later.“Hopefully I can kick on.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44236529-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44236529-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44236529-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44236529-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"mcinnes started homework early","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes began preparation for the Europa League clash with FC Chikhura Sachkere on the flight back to Scotland after defeating RoPS Rovaniemi in Finland.McInnes studied scouting reports of the Georgians’ two games against CS Fola Esch of Luxembourg in the previous round on the flight which touched down early yesterday morning.He will also study extensive footage of Sachkere who the Dons face at the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, Tbilisi, on Thursday .McInnes said: “We had match reports to read on the Georgians on the plane on the way home and will start to get a grip on them over the next few days.“We had our scouts out for both their games against Fola Esch.

This is going to let us trace the stories of the people linked to the first reference of the still.“The royal references are really limited but these will allow us to build up the story with the surrounding context. It’s going to let us put names and inidual people to the story of this still.”The record also includes suggestions about where the still may have been located – with the spot believed to be on a street already associated with whisky.Dr Armstrong added: “Andrew Gray had property in a street known as Guestrow.“Today just a small section of Guestrow remains and it is home to the appropriately named ‘Illicit Still’ pub.“The name recalls a later age when whisky was crafted for sale undetected by the taxman, but it is possible that its location has a connection to the history of Scotch going back much further.“This is a very signicant find in the history of our national drink. It reframes the story of Scotch whisky and suggests new layers of complexity in Scotland’s urban history.” vw, px\"  Dr Hawes said: “All references to aquavite or whisky from this period are signicant because its early development is largely unrecorded.“This could signicantly change our understanding of the origins of our national drink.”City archivist Phil Astley added: “This incredible find illustrates what an amazing resource the UNESCO-recognised Aberdeen Burgh Registers are for the study of Scottish urban history.“The detailed picture of late-medieval society that emerges from these records is one of a developing social structure increasingly influenced by the cultural, scientic and educational forces of the Renaissance period.”Researchers have now been awarded £, by Chivas Brothers to fund research into the still.Head of heritage and education Alex Robertson said: “This is a truly signicant and exciting discovery for Scotch whisky.“Given Chivas Brothers’ historical ties with Aberdeen, we did not hesitate to lend our support to the furtherance of this important research.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though.

The tanker was reportedly allowed to resume navigation.France and Germany joined condemnation of Iranrsquos actions, which have triggered concerns that it will lead to further oil price hikes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf involving Iran, the US and UK..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Government  ulooking at series of options u over tanker seized by Iran"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-stately-home-turns-steampunk-fantasy-forest-event","story":"Fantasy fans were given the chance to roam the grounds of a stately home in Gloucestershire for a weekend celebrating all forms of cosplay.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances.

Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"woman-found-nearly-three-times-drink-driving-limit","story":"Jacqueline Johnstone, of St Germains Terrace, was caught drink-driving at Gilbert Avenue in North Berwick.Johnstone, , was found to have mg of alcohol in ml of breath during the incident ndash the legal limit is mg.She appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court, where she pleaded guilty to the offence, which took place on May .Sherf Pamela Bowman banned Johnstone from driving for  months and fined her pound.She was allowed to take part in a drink-driving rehabilitation scheme which could reduce her ban by a quarter."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-high-school-roll-set-top-1-000-extension-planned","story":"The school, which welcomes pupils from the surrounding villages as well as North Berwick, currently has a school roll of .However, that figure is expected to increase, with the town continuing to grow and the school set to become the fourth secondary school in the county with more than , pupils.Three extensions ndash in ,  and  ndash have already been carried out on the school to accommodate the growth of the town.Now, the proposed extension would cater for a school roll of up to ,.Plans submitted to East Lothian Council note: ldquoThe completed building will provide state-of-the-art teaching and social space facilities in line with the clientrsquos brief as well as promoting energy efficiency and offering facilities which signal the high value placed on learning at North Berwick High School.ldquoThe project is to reflect the standards commensurate with a modern school facility and provide a high-quality environment that will inspire both staff and young people to achieve their full potential.The proposed extension would occupy an area to the south-west of the existing buildings, bordered by the synthetic pitch and the site boundary with the schoolrsquos neighbours Law Primary School.The document states: ldquoThe location of the proposed extension will offer views out over the sports pitches and towards North Berwick Law.The ground floor of the three-storey extension will become home to the home economics department, with a shared social and exhibition space.Social sciences will be based on the first floor, with the languages department on the second floor and ldquolarge shared breakout spaces at the heart of the floorplan.The plans from Innovate East Lothian Ltd, which is acting on behalf of East Lothian Council, could go before the local authorityrsquos planning committee later this year.Currently, Dunbar Grammar School , Musselburgh Grammar Schooland Ross High Schoolin Tranent all have more than , pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"council-remove-recycling-wheelie-bins-contamination","story":"East Lothian Council is one of the few local authorities in Scotland to retain recycling boxes for most of its households and has a  per cent recycling rate ndash higher than the national average.However, Tom Reid, the councilrsquos head of infrastructure, revealed that it had rolled out , communal recycling bins in small communities and densely populated streets.But, he said, the result had been a much higher contamination level in the recycled waste which suggested thatbins were rolled out across the county it could cost the council up to poundmillion.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abour how Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9798482.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

But we havenrsquot built a diesel campervan in two years.While an all-electric campervan would certainly tick a few ldquogreen boxes, issues such as finding a recharging spot in the middle of nowhere make their practicality tough for even the toughest of camper.Instead, Mr Hayes claims to have pioneered the next best thing ndash the worldrsquos first fully hybrid and ldquotribrid four-wheel-drive fully independent campervans, powered by low-emission petrol engines and a hybrid battery that also powers white appliances.The design removes the need for gas fuel and a V hook-up for power. The result, he says, is a ldquogame-changer. in the modern campervan market ndash and perhaps some peace of mind for the environmentally-conscious camper.ldquoElectric vehicle range isnrsquot there, he says. ldquoThe point with a campervan is you want to get to places where yoursquore quite far away from home. Yoursquore not going to park up and find somewhere to charge your vehicle.ldquoThe hybrid petrol and electric system is designed to use electric around town and, when yoursquore out on the road, you use petrol.ldquoItrsquos self-charging ndash so when yoursquore driving on the petrol engine, every time you slow down or brake, you recharge the battery.His design for an LPG -fuelled van is even greener, emitting fewer toxic gases than petrol or diesel ndash and itrsquos cheaper.Eco-Campers, which has received backing from Scottish Enterprise, has positioned itself as an innovator in hybrid technologies and has worked hand-in-hand with researchers at leading universities to develop new energy sources and improved hybrid batteries for its vans.Such is demand that the business anticipates seeing its turnover rise by % over the next five years, while there are plans to expand the technology to markets in Canada, Australia and America.However, a boost in green credentials is unlikely to be much comfort to islanders and rural communities struggling to cope with the influx of large vehicles on narrow roads.For Western Isles residents and businesses hoping to squeeze on to ferries, campervans and motorhomes have added to the pressure: while just  took the Ullapool-to-Stornaway ferry in -, an estimated , used it  years later.Over the same period, the figure for Uig to Tarbert in Harris jumped from  to ,, while Oban to Castlebrae rose from  to .The roll-out of the Road Equivalent Tarfin the Western Isles, which has reduced fares, is thought to have encouraged many on to roads.Meanwhile just getting anywhere with your campervan is becoming a challenge in itself: the pick of campsites on key routes regularly display lsquono vacanciesrsquo signs, while earlier this year campervan tickets for the th Tiree Music Festival sold out within  minutes of going on sale.ldquoIn terms of scenery, the Western Isles plays host to some of the most spectacular landscapes and habitats in the world, and it is not surprising that RET has led to a large increase in the number of campervans travelling to the islands to experience this, says Alasdair Allan, MSP.ldquoTourism has taken on an increasing importance to the economy of the islands in recent years, says MSP Alasdair Allan. ldquoFor it to be sustainable, it is vitally important we have the right infrastructure in place and that the effects of tourism are not felt to be in conflict with island communities.ldquoThat means making sure there are sufficient waste disposal units, enough parking berths and available advice for driving on island roads.ldquoIt also means finding ways to ensure islanders donrsquot suffer as a result of the large demand for deck spaces on ferries.ldquoTo this end, I very much welcome the recent moves by the Scottish Government in looking to pilot a scheme that would keep some car space held back for islanders who need to travel at short notice."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mackenna-glasgow-39-s-miles-worse-time-snp-can-39-t-blame-tories","story":"And yet it must be true, mustnrsquot it  All those lestyle surveys telling us that wersquore the friendliest, rock n roll city on the planet: best for nightle top for student experience best UK retail emporiums outside of London cool restaurants around every corner and some of them vegan too.

It is a city that is in economic and political decline.Those of us who have spent most of our lives living and working in Glasgow know which version of Glasgow is the authentic one. Lestyle surveys never extend to the sprawling neighbourhoods that lie to the north and east of the city. In these places multi-deprivation and health inequality remain among the worst in Europe, as they have been for more than a century. Many of Mr Smithrsquos union members live in these places. Until now the social challenges faced by these communities could be camouflaged in the breathless optimism of economic brochures selling an inward investment Xanadu to their fabled blue-chip companies.If they are proclaiming more than , businessesare located in the Glasgow city region and that they support more than , jobsthen they inadvertently paint a bleak picture. Why do so many Glaswegian families remain locked out of this economic Klondyke  No matter how spectacular a cityrsquos economic growth might be no matter how optimistic its long-term projections, these are shallow and meaninglesstens of thousands of people in the same old communities are unable to share in the bounty. Real growth and not this sham facsimile of it would trickle down into these places instead of accumulating in the bank accounts of the same few.Affluence and success can make you blind to the fact that Glaswegian men can lose  years of their le expectancy on a seven-mile stretch of the M from east to west. But when backdoor privatisation results in truncated essential services and a non-union workforce, the signs of decline begin to encroach on the city centre and the leafier neighbourhoods. Ultimately, tenants will pay more for additional services like bin collections. Rather than investing in these services they outsource to private firms, the least of whose concerns is the welfare of their workers and the cost to tenants. This is always how privatisation works.Meanwhile, the meter on Glasgowrsquos equal pay scandal is still running. The entire fabric of the city has been mortgaged to meet the bill, but this extends only to . The city will have to find more cash to pay those women who have been working since then at an unequal rate.Meanwhile, the sht and concentration of economic and political power to boutique Edinburgh continues. What sort of country permits a much smaller city to operate twice as many flights and trains to London as the larger one in terms of population and business  Why does Glasgow Airport, which still resembles a brick port-a-cabin in places, still lack a rail link We learned too this week that Scotland has now become the worst country for drug deaths. This must surely be fake news. How can this be so when Glasgow, its biggest city, is so happy and cheery and friendly all the time  As surely as a broken tumbler follows a dirty look, the supporters of the Scottish Government blamed the Tories for not giving them the powers to address this. The worst rates of drug addiction are in Scotlandrsquos poorest neighbourhoods and form part of the pattern of deprivation and disadvantage in these places. We have devolved power in this area. You canrsquot begin to deal with drugs until you first address the chronic health inequalities in these communities.Scotlandrsquos future economic prosperity rests on the performance of its biggest and most important city. Glasgow needs a political, cultural and economic champion at the heart of government but you wonrsquot find it in this Scottish cabinet."},{"url":null,"title":"british-airways-suspends-flights-cairo-security-precaution","story":"The airlines, two of the biggest in Europe, released separate statements announcing the

But that is not expected to take long.Malcolm Leslie, director of country house sales in Strutt  Parkerrsquos Edinburgh office, said: ldquoFundamentally, demand outstrips supply and buyers are frustrated at the lack of properties on the market.\"As a result, prime properties which do come to the market are met with exceptional demand, particularly rural family homes within striking distance of urban centres.\"One property recently marketed had more than  viewings in two weeks and attracted several offers at a closing date. It is now under offer.Further north, a sporting estate in one of the most remote locations on the Scottish mainland is being sold for more than pound million. Straddling the western end of Loch Monar in Ross-shire, ,-acre Pait and West Monar Estate is mostly only accessible by boat stis in the shadow of three Munros Sgurr a Chaorachain, Sgurr Choinnich, and Lurg Mhor.But buyers should beware - the main property on the estate, a Victorian hunting lodge, only received electricity in  and is mostly still lit with oil lamps.For househunters whose dream home would boast more environmentally-friendly measures, a specially-constructed four-bedroom family dwelling in Stirlingshire ticks all the right boxes.Muir Estate, near Thornhill, was designed by the Swedish architect Maumlrtha Wachtmeister and the current owner Jimmi Enevoldsen and is now on sale for offers over pound. million.Surrounded by a Christmas tree farm, the lodge was built on the site of a ruin with some of the old stone used in the construction, and is heated through a ground-sourced system while the insulation has been built made  per cent thicker than standard.:From Bigfoot to mermaids and Mars attacks - how hoaxes have fooled the worldMr Enevoldsen said: ldquoWe have enjoyed the secluded nature of the estate and the peace, quiet and wildle that comes with that.

A farmer discovered the remains of a local Bronze Age woman, the Queen of the Inch, in the s.

An archaeological project commissioned by the current owner uncovered ious artefacts including carved stones and the largest collection of slate in the British Isles, important because of its implications for monastic schooling. The excavated remains point to the existence of an early Christian centre of some importance.The eighth century saw the island fall prey to Viking raids and it is believed victims of the th century Battle of Largs between Norway and Scotland were buried on the island. Additionally, Inchmarnock is rumoured to have been popular with smugglers, its woodland and craggy shoreline an ideal hiding place for contraband.Meanwhile in the th century, legend has it that an alcoholic from Bute was banished alone to Inchmarnock to overcome her addiction.More recently, the island was used as a training ground for D-Day preparations in World War Two and bomb craters are still evident.Inchmarnock was once home to  residents but the final permanent resident, a Bute farming tenant, left the island in .But it is not only windswept moors, Lochside retreats and isolated islands which are being rated as the most desirable property purchases in Scotland. Townhouses and chic urban dwellings also make the list, especially in Edinburgh, Scotlands fastest-growing property market for a number of years.Estate agents have flagged up Northhumberland Street , a six-bedroom full townhouse with private garden in the heart of the capitals Georgian New Town as an example of the type of prime property changing hands with asking prices in the millions.The dwelling, priced at offers over poundmillion, is spread over two storeys and sits close to exclusive schools such as the Edinburgh Academy, Fettes College, St Georges School for Girls.Andrew Riddell, senior associate director in Strutt  Parkerrsquos Edinburgh office, said: ldquoFamily homes in Edinburgh are very, very popular and competition is fierce when prime properties come to the market. The most sought after are in New Town, Stockbridge, the West End, Murrayfield, Morningside, Bruntsfield and the Grange.\"I have recently marketed several family homes which have attracted stf competition and either gone under offer within days of coming to the market or gone to a closing date.

Nevertheless, setting out his resignation timetable on The Andrew Marr Show was still remarkable.There was a giddy, ldquoschoolrsquosout air across all the Sunday shows. If British politics was a bog standard comprehensive there would be a sports day to mark end of term, maybe a trip to the cinema. Instead, Westminster will unveil the new Liberal Democrat leader today and the new head of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the UK tomorrow. Parliament then rises for the summer on Thursday. Brexit crisis, what Brexit crisis : Hammond set to resignMr Hammond will resign after Theresa May finishes her final Prime Ministerrsquos Questions on Wednesday, and before she makes that last lonely trip to Buckingham Palace.It was almost asthe Chancellor had given a lot of pleasurable thought to how he could spoil the new PMrsquos first day.Several of the Sunday papers had photos of Mr Hammond putting suitcases into the boot of his car as though his evacuation of Number  had already begun.Sorry to disappoint, he told Marr, but he was only doing what he did every week, heading home with a suitcase , and he would be heading back with the same one come Monday morning. It was a big case for a few bits and bobs. One of the advantages of being on the backbenches, Mr Hammond will discover in time, is that no-one will ever again find his luggage interesting.Though he was shortly to be out of the job of Chancellor, Mr Hammond was as chipper as any man who has a few million quid in the bank and does not need to worry about his next mortgage payment. The Chancellorrsquos mood set fair, Marr tried a joke. Known to date by the nickname of ldquoSpreadsheet Phil, did Mr Hammond fancy changing to something racier to go with his future as a backbench rebel  How about Phil Guea, Marr suggested  Mmm. Wisely, the Scot stopped there before he could go on to propose Phil Trotsky or Phil Danton.After the resignation announcement, the rest of the interview was about Phil-ing time, although there was one moment when Marr askedMr Hammond would go against the Government in a no confidence vote. He did not rule it out, but he did not rule it in either. Mr Johnson might call this a have cake and eat it position the rest of us would say it was a politician being a politician.: No deal Brexit trouble for everyoneMarr had by far the best line-up yesterday, with Ridge on Sunday reduced to talking to Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, about the alliance between Remain parties in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election. The most memorable takeaway from the encounter was the chilling notion that sideburns are still considered fashionable in Wales.Otherwise, Sophy Ridgersquos guests included Richard Burgon, the Shadow Justice Secretary. The two got into a spat over whether she had read a speech in full. She had, she informed him, looking rather mfed. As well she might. Since Andrew Neil and Boris Johnsonrsquos tussle over paragraphs b and c in GATT politicians and presenters have taken to trying to trip each other up on details. It will end in tears, but they will not be those of Ms Ridge, who does her homework.Elsewhere, the Sunday shows were all about jobs. Not the possible , that could be lost in Ireland should there be a no deal Brexit, according to Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy PM and guest on Marr, but the vacancies in the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.: SNP beacon of hopeIain Duncan Smith was introduced on Marr as the man being tipped as deputy PM to Boris Johnson. IDS insisted he had bid for nothing, asked for nothing, andhe got nothing he would still be a happy man. On Sunday Politics Scotland, Jo Swinson was similarly sunny, smiling gamely when presenter Gordon Brewer said she had been seen as a shoo-in for LibDem leader but some reports on postal votes suggested the contest with Sir Ed Davey was closer than expected. No votes had yet been counted, she said, she remained hopeful, but was not taking anything for granted. Would this outbreak of optimism never end The SNPrsquos Westminster leader was up next and he was in a good mood, too.

Something to do, perhaps, with the unexpectedly large majority last week against proroguing parliament. Now, Mr Blackford was ldquopretty convinced something could be done to take no deal off the table, even though it might only have a few days to get the job done.

The drive to eliminate unnecessary plastic waste meant that kg of waste ndash  per cent of all waste generated ndash was recycled at the end of last yearrsquos festival, which attracted , people.The heavy sum equals  per cent of all waste generated at the event, which last year saw , people attend. Paper, cardboard and other materials were either recycled or sent to a digester and erted from landfill.Ian Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: ldquoHebCelt has been a leader in recent years for more environmentally friendly festivals through the introduction of reusable cups and other measures, such as the decision to ban single-use plastic and use recyclable and biodegradable alternatives instead.ldquoThese moves show a step in the right direction as single-use packaging is often a problem at large-scale events.ldquoThe environmental impact from this type of large-scale event can be reduced by removing any unnecessary item or replacing it with a re-usable alternative.Greenpeace estimates that around . million tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans each year across the world, and green charities from across the country say while festivals play a large part in contributing to plastic waste they also raise awareness of its environmental impact.ldquoIt is great to see Hebridean Celtic Festival continuing to take action to reduce their climate and environmental impact, said climate campaigner of Friends of Earth Scotland Caroline Rance.ldquoAll business and institutions must take steps to signicantly cut their use of fossil fuels and lessen their organisationrsquos contribution to climate change.ldquoFestivals, and the arts more widely, have a really important role in engaging people in these important issues and inspiring them to take action.ldquoHebCelt was ahead of the curve in banning plastic straws and introducing reusable cups five years ago, and banning single-use plastic last year.ldquoPlastic pollution is a huge problem which has really captured the public attention, but plastics are indicative of larger problems of our throwaway society that fails to make products that last.ldquoMuch of a festivalrsquos impact comes from transport, and, whilst a festival in the Hebrides presents unique logistical and transport challenges, we would encourage festival organisers to keep thinking about how to get more people to reduce the impact of their journey.Although HebCelt appears to have been ahead of the curve, Ms Maclennan says there is still more to be done.To this end, the festival has joined forces with Tighean Innse Gall , the housing and energy agency for the Outer Hebrides, to help raise awareness of climate change.ldquoWe want to continue to improve our actions and spread the word amongst our audience, artists and contractors, Ms Maclennan said. ldquoThis year, our partnership with TIG will help get the message out to more people which can only help us in our ongoing aims.Not only were the team on site to talk to revellers about the environment, they also supplied an electric Tesla car to drive main headline act KT Tunstall and others to the festival site. ldquoI applaud HebCeltrsquos efforts to tackle environmental issues and raise awareness amongst an international audience, Tunstall said.ldquoWith the help of TIG this year, they are helping to bring important issues to the attention of thousands of people which can only help in the fight against climate change.And it appears other events across the country are also making the switch to more environmentally friendly alternatives to some of the most damaging materialsZero Wastersquos Mr Gulland said: ldquoWersquove grown accustomed to the pictures of piles of litter and waste left behind after festivals, but we are increasingly seeing it does not have to be this way.Mr Gulland added: ldquoThis year, many organisers have noticeably ramped up their sustainability efforts. Glastonbury succeeded in convincing campers to take their tents home and TRNSMT operated a deposit scheme for cups and bottles.Earlier this month, at Glasgowrsquos TRNSMT festival, a deposit scheme was introduced whereby revellers to encourage used cups, made of paper, back to a kiosk to get their p paid at point of purchase.Annually, those attending Glastonbury go through over one million plastic bottles annually, and this year the festival scrapped the offending materials entirely.In Glasgow, summer festival TRNSMT introduced a cupscheme, wherein revelers were asked to bring used drinks cups ndash made of paper ndash to a dedicated kiosk, in exchange for a p deposit paid at point of purchase.Glasgowrsquos TRNSMT aims to remove plastic from its site completely by  and took signicant steps this year by reducing single use plastics and introducing more water refill points."},{"url":null,"title":"tributes-former-msp-trish-godman","story":"Ms Godman represented West Renfrewshire from  until her retirement in , and was Holyroods deputy presiding officer for eight years.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard described Ms Godman as \"determined and principled\".He tweeted: \"On behalf of the Scottish Labour Party, I extend our condolences on the sad news of the death of former Scottish Labour MSP and deputy Presiding Officer Trish Godman.\"Determined and principled, Trish was a great fighter for her constituents and for the Labour Party.

Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “HIAL’s commitment to access for all passengers has been recognised for a third year by the CAA, acknowledging the hard work by all our staff to ensure our airports are as inclusive as possible.#As an organisation, we work with local disability organisations and iniduals to ensure we are always improving our offerings to better meet their needs and provide assistance where required.“For Kirkwall to be listed as Very Good in its first year of reaching the required passenger threshold is a testament to the hard work staff put in to accommodate disabled and mobility restricted passengers.“Kirkwall has made several upgrades to its facilities for those with additional needs in recent years including changing the flooring in the security area from carpet to lino and adding additional counter space in disabled toilets.“We continue to invest and improve and will provide staff with additional disabilities training.#The CAA’s framework was introduced to ensure there is a consistent and high-quality service for disabled passengers across UK airports.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Alter your course immediately. I want to inspect the ship for security reasons.HMS Montrose replied: ldquoYou must not impair, impede, obstruct or hamper the passage of the Stena Impero. Please confirm that you are not intending to violate international law by attempting to board.Reports from Tehran state those on board the Stena Impero are safe and well.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he will unveil the diplomatic and economic measures on Monday in response to the apprehension and detention of the Stena Imperto, according to the Sunday .The paper said London may also seek the reimposing of UN and EU sanctions which were lted against Iran in  in connection to a deal on the countryrsquos nuclear programme.Askedsanctions were off the table during Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Mr Ellwood said: ldquoCobrawas taking place yesterday so wersquore looking at the operational responsibilities from that but yes, we are going to be looking at a series of options.Weve seen a ratcheting up of tensions in the Middle East ndash Defence Minister @Tobias_Ellwood says Irans seizure of a British-flagged ship in the Gulf is a hostile act and that the UK is looking to deescalate the crisis. To , head here: https:t.co skUzsIA pic jTghdtyumdash Ridge on SundayJuly , Meanwhile, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon claimed the situation in Iran could be even worse than the war in Iraq.Mr Burgon told the same programme: ldquoIf we end up in a conflict backed by Donald Trump then I think it would not only be comparable with Iraq, in fact it could be even worse than Iraq, and that should really scare everybody.He added: ldquoWe need sensible negotiations. Wersquove got a really important part to play diplomatically in this.

Parliament  be updated Monmdash Jeremy HuntJuly , On Saturday, Mr Hunt said Iranrsquos actions raised ldquovery serious questions about the security of British and international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.The Foreign Secretary told reporters inside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that, having spoken to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zar, Tehran saw the situation as a ldquotit for tat following the detention of Grace  in Gibraltar.ldquoNothing could be further from the truth, he said.Mr Hunt said MPs would be updated about what ldquofurther measures the Government will take on Monday, adding that the threat level had been raised to three.ldquoOur priority continues to be to find a way to de-escalate the situation.ldquoThatrsquos why I reached out to the Iranian foreign minister, thatrsquos why due process in Gibraltar continues.ldquoWe need to see due process happening in Iran as well, we need to see the illegal seizing of a British flagged vessel reversed, we need that ship released, and we continue to be very concerned about the safety and welfare of the  crew members.The Foreign Office earlier summoned the Iranian charge drsquoaffaires, Mohsen Omidzamani, following the incident.Iran has directly linked the seizure of the vessel with Britainrsquos role in detaining a tanker carrying Iranian oil earlier this month.A spokesman for IranrsquosCouncil was quoted as saying ldquothe rule of reciprocal action is well known in international law and that Tehran made the right decision in the face of an ldquoillegitimate economic war and seizure of oil tankers.The explanation, which contrasts with a suggestion on Friday night that the Stena Impero was ldquoviolating international maritime rules and had collided with a fishing boat, came as the UK Government warned British ships to stay away from the Strait of Hormuz.HMS Montrose, which is patrolling the Persian Gulf to protect shipping, and earlier this month intercepted Iranian patrol boats surrounding another UK-flagged tanker, reportedly arrived minutes too late to prevent the latest incident.A second oil tanker, the Liberian-flagged Mesdar, which is managed by Norbulk Shipping UK, veered off course towards the Iranian coast after it was boarded by armed guards at about .pm on Friday.Communication with the ship was later re-established and the crew were unharmed. The tanker was reportedly allowed to resume navigation.France and Germany joined condemnation of Iranrsquos actions, which have triggered concerns that it will lead to further oil price hikes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf involving Iran, the US and UK.copy -.

During their whistle stop tours of the land, much of the talk has, naturally, been about Brexit, our relationship with the United States and promises of tax cuts for iniduals and businesses.While these issues may capture the imagination of the , Tory party members, who are deciding who will be our next PM, there are plenty of other pressing matters that the next resident of No  Downing Street will need to keep in mind. Ensuring that everybody has access to a good workplace pension is one of them.As it stands, there are more people saving in a pension than at any time in our history. This is down to the success of auto-enrolment pensions – a policy that has welcomed some  million new pensions savers since .It has been a genuine success. So far. But there is more to do. Contributions from inidual workers and their employers have gradually been rising from a low base, reaching eight per cent of salary in April of this year.Monitoring how employees have responded to the April increase is crucial before any further tweaks are made to auto-enrolment policy.Westminster itself recognises the need for improvement. The  Auto Enrolment Review endorsed the case for making pensions contributions count from the first pound of salary, rather than anything after £,. This would have a material effect on the prospects of lower and middle-income workers building up a decent sized pot for retirement. But no timetable has yet emerged for implementation.Politics is in flux of course and commitments can fall by the wayside. But this delay is sensible. Auto-enrolment has worked so far because it has been evidence-based. It would also be important to stage gradually the implementation of a “contributions from the first pound earned” policy because of its greater impact on lower earners.More immediately, the government should consider measures to bring the benefits of auto-enrolment pension saving to more women.Women make up only around a third of those auto-enrolled so far. Reducing the “enrolment trigger” from £, a year from one job to the primary National Insurance threshold level – £, – would bring the benefits of auto-enrolment to another half a million people, three-quarters of whom would be women.This would help auto-enrolment play its full role in tackling the gender pensions gap. As things stand the average woman retires with a pension income £, less than her male counterpart.

But Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said Theresa May’s successor must take a strong line on the constitution.“Whatever your views on the new Prime Minister, the last thing Scotland needs is another isive independence referendum and more constitutional chaos,” she said.“Nicola Sturgeon will use this moment to launch a major new drive to ide us, capitalising on the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit. This is a time for cool heads and rational response, and the PM must not rise to the SNP’s desperate grievance tactics or stoop to the nationalists’ level.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also called for the referendum issue to be parked and for greater focus on Scottish public services.“The SNP laid out a blueprint for an independent Scotland in  and the public said no.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again.

Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal.

The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type.

We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less..."},{"url":null,"title":"amaryllis takes top prize at shetland race first leg reception ","story":"The prizes for the Bergen to Lerwick leg of the Pantaenius Shetland Race were handed out at a civic reception at Mareel on Friday evening..

He said it was his governments view it was not the right time for a poll - or to be calling for such a vote.The ambassador pointed out a border poll was provided for in the Good Friday Agreement andthe Secretary of State thought it would result in a vote for unication it would be an \"entirely legitimate exercise for whenever that would occur\".\"The view of the Irish government is that now is not the time to be pressing for or campaigning for such a border poll,\" he said.The SDLP has said a border poll should happen but after Brexit has been settled.Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald once said a border poll should not be held during the Brexit uncertainty. In August  she said she would prefer not to hold a border poll in the context of a “crash or very hard Brexit”, arguing it would be the wrong “climate” for such a debate.However, she later insisted her party wanted a poll \"as soon as possible\" and it has called for a poll on a number of occasions since.Ambassador ONeill said the view of his government was that finding agreement with Brexit should not be \"conflated\" with the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.Irish Ambassador to the UK Adrian O’Neill says an Irish border poll would degrade the prospects of finding a way through on Brexit#WeekinWestminster[tap to expand] pic uOyfFiCU— BBC PoliticsJuly , Irish Ambassador to the UK Adrian O’Neill says any attempts to blame Ireland for the impact of a no-deal Brexit would not be credible#WeekinWestminster[tap to expand] pic wEmPpAq— BBC PoliticsJuly , \"We think that would actually only perhaps degrade the prospects of finding a way through on Brexit, and perhaps also inhibit our chances of getting the devolved institutions of Northern Ireland back up and running,\" he told the BBC.\"That is the priority of the government - getting those devolved institutions up and running and we are really hopeful we can make a break through there.\"Read More, Northern Ireland jobs at risk in no-deal Brexit, say Stormont officialsMr ONeill said a no-deal Brexit was a \"signicant risk\" which they had to prepare for it.

We’ve got a really important part to play diplomatically in this. We can use our negotiating weight.“I think that our Government has international respect and this country has international respect in a way that Donald Trump doesn’t. I think we need to use that for the purposes of conflict resolution and for the purposes of making sure this doesn’t escalate out of control.”We’ve already got a wide raft of sanctions against Iran, particularly financial sanctions, so it’s not clear that there are immediate things we can do but we are of course looking at all the options.Philip HammondChancellor Philip Hammond also denied claims that the Government had taken its “eye off the ball” over the Iran crisis.He told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “No, I don’t think the Government has taken its eye off the ball – we’ve been very much engaged with both the Americans and our European partners in the response to Iran’s increasing defiance of the JCPOA over the last few months.”AskedBritain could introduce new sanctions or freeze Iranian assets, Mr Hammond said: “We’ve already got a wide raft of sanctions against Iran, particularly financial sanctions, so it’s not clear that there are immediate things we can do but we are of course looking at all the options.”Govt emergency cttee COBR met again this pm.Reaffirmed UK desire to de-escalate but confirmed Stena Impero was seized in OMANI waters in clear contravention of international law  discussed how  secure safety of UK int shipping in Straits of Hormuz. Parliament  be updated Mon— Jeremy HuntJuly , On Saturday, Mr Hunt said Iran’s actions raised “very serious questions” about the security of British and international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.The Foreign Secretary told reporters inside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that, having spoken to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zar, Tehran saw the situation as a “tit for tat” following the detention of Grace  in Gibraltar.“Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said.Mr Hunt said MPs would be updated about what “further measures” the Government will take on Monday, adding that the threat level had been raised to three.“Our priority continues to be to find a way to de-escalate the situation.“That’s why I reached out to the Iranian foreign minister, that’s why due process in Gibraltar continues.“We need to see due process happening in Iran as well, we need to see the illegal seizing of a British flagged vessel reversed, we need that ship released, and we continue to be very concerned about the safety and welfare of the  crew members.”The Foreign Office earlier summoned the Iranian charge d’affaires, Mohsen Omidzamani, following the incident.Iran has directly linked the seizure of the vessel with Britain’s role in detaining a tanker carrying Iranian oil earlier this month.A spokesman for Iran’sCouncil was quoted as saying “the rule of reciprocal action is well known in international law” and that Tehran made the right decision in the face of an “illegitimate economic war and seizure of oil tankers”.The explanation, which contrasts with a suggestion on Friday night that the Stena Impero was “violating international maritime rules” and had collided with a fishing boat, came as the UK Government warned British ships to stay away from the Strait of Hormuz.HMS Montrose, which is patrolling the Persian Gulf to protect shipping, and earlier this month intercepted Iranian patrol boats surrounding another UK-flagged tanker, reportedly arrived minutes too late to prevent the latest incident.A second oil tanker, the Liberian-flagged Mesdar, which is managed by Norbulk Shipping UK, veered off course towards the Iranian coast after it was boarded by armed guards at about .pm on Friday.Communication with the ship was later re-established and the crew were unharmed. The tanker was reportedly allowed to resume navigation.France and Germany joined condemnation of Iran’s actions, which have triggered concerns that it will lead to further oil price hikes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf involving Iran, the US and UK."},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures stately home turns steampunk for fantasy forest event","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry.

There is currently, after years of campaigning, a genuine momentum of support building in Dublin and in London for a new university here.“We need to harness this carefully and creatively, to deliver a standalone Higher Education institution for our city region.“There is a real chance to redress  years of isolation and alienation and to build hope and prosperity for future generations in northwest Ireland.“We must be careful not to be side-tracked into short-term fixes as we have been before. We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wN1xcXC8xOTE1NTE1N1xcXC9PZmZsZWFkLTEtcGljLTEwMjR4NzY4LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjMyN2UwOTU4ZjdmMDJhNzUzYmRkMDJmYWZiY2ZiZTRjNDY2ZjhmZjUifQ==/offlead-1-pic-1024x768.png","title":"rare breed star cahir launches annual agricultural show","story":"A young boy from Dungiven has helped to launch this weekend’s Co Londonderry and Limavady Agricultural Show.Young Cahir McGilligan, who found fame on the recent series of UTV’s Rare Breed, was on hand to launch the show which takes place tomorrow, Saturday, July .Avid farmer Cahir was delighted to be able to help out and is looking forward to participating himself.The annual show, which will be held at Aghanloo, Limavady, will see a number of events taking place throughout the day.These include horse and pony showing and jumping working hunter classes.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshLivestock showingand a fencing competition will also take place.Other attractions include home industries, crafts, vegetables and flowers, fun and games and numerous trade stands and young farmers tug of war.Updates can be found on their Facebook page.Cahir McGilligan is pictured above with the Chairman Mr Alwyn McFarlane and Mr Stanley Warnock who want to encourage everyone to attend the show for a great family day out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances.

I just missed it on the wrong side too many times, but all in all, itrsquos a pretty good week.ldquoItrsquos a step in the right direction for sure. It shows I can compete out here.ldquoMy confidence has been pretty high, but itrsquos definitely going to boost that a little.ldquoItrsquos my first time being in contention on the European Tour so Irsquom proud of the way I handled myself on and off the golf course.Sharvin, who turned professional after being a member of the winning Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team in , received huge support from friends and family who travelled to the Co Clare venue.Ranked th in the world before the championship began, Sharvin, who mainly plies his trade on the Challenge Tour, cut the figure of someone who belongs on a bigger stage.He has a classic swing, drives superbly, has a tidy short game and possesses a superb temperament.ldquoI really felt like I took it one shot at a time out there and did that really well, he enthused.A top ten finish would have earned Sharvin a ticket into this weekrsquos Scottish Open andthe potential to claim one of the three spots on offer to next weekrsquos Open at Portrush.ldquoIrsquove tried not to get too bogged down with results and outcome, and thatrsquos just going to come from the process of what Irsquove been doing the last year and a half, trying to get to the next level, he explained.ldquoI know therersquos more there and that will give me confidence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Dee and Mackenzie never take a breather  ","story":"THE Murray family began the first of what was to prove an historic and richly rewarding week in athletics circles when they took part in the latest North Down Track and Field event on Tuesday night at Bangor.Mackenzie really set the standard for what was to follow when, after competing in the kg shot putt in which he scored . metres, he then proceeded to set a new PB .. in the ,m race in which he was second overall, in a field of  which contained several top quality adult runners.Dee, meantime, was in equally good form setting a new PB of .. for the k race, was only  seconds behind the race winner.Lucy OrsquoNeill also took part in the m U- girlsrsquo sprint and later scored an ever-improving .m in the U- girlsrsquo shot putt, an encouraging warm up for next weekendrsquos All Ireland TF championships in Tullamore.GreyabbeyAlready one of the most prolic and competitive duos anywhere, not only in the number of races participated in, but in terms of miles travelled to meetings, the father and son pairing then made the trip to Greyabbey on Friday night to take part in the two races there.Dee opted for the k and Mackenzie, having no choice, as the rules presently restrict him to the k distance, gave it a real go. He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in .. Paul Lloyd was st in . and Donal Smith placed th in  minutes on the button, out of a total of  runners.DelamontAs Van Morrison once said: ldquoMy momma told me therersquod be days like this,Thus was described East Downrsquos fantastic day out in Delamont on Saturday in the  X k relays, a new and exciting event organised by the Daye Brothers aka Atlas Running, which required teams of five runners each, with each one running a klap as the hot and hilly trails and paths around Delamont were described.At one point we thought we wouldnrsquot have enough runners to fill three teams so to get four teams of five representing East Down was pretty damn impressive.Some pretty impressive performances from the East Down gang as well with victories for the menrsquos A team and the mixed team and third in the all female team.Massive well done to all involved especially the team captain, Deirdre Weatherall who rallied the troops with carrots and sticks and a promise of ice creams, that did not materialise.All agreed that she did a fine job of getting  names in the hat and in the right place at the right time. It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second.

including the potential for further violence - during a meeting with local groups and political representatives in Armagh.In July, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald urged the Irish Government to start preparing for a border poll as the risk of a disorderly Brexit increased.Ms McDonald said a referendum on Irish unity could happen “very quickly”the UK crashed out of the EU at the end of October.Doug Beattie: Once again we urge the DUP to stop the HIU legacy scandal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingTributes paid to Northern Ireland road racer Darren Keys following fatal crash at WalderstownThe th Open Championship -

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential.

The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please confirm that you are not intending to violate international law by attempting to board.Reports from Tehran state those on board the Stena Impero are safe and well.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he will unveil the diplomatic and economic measures on Monday in response to the apprehension and detention of the Stena Imperto, according to the Sunday .The paper said London may also seek the reimposing of UN and EU sanctions which were lted against Iran in  in connection to a deal on the countryrsquos nuclear programme.Askedsanctions were off the table during Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Mr Ellwood said: ldquoCobrawas taking place yesterday so wersquore looking at the operational responsibilities from that but yes, we are going to be looking at a series of options.Weve seen a ratcheting up of tensions in the Middle East ndash Defence Minister @Tobias_Ellwood says Irans seizure of a British-flagged ship in the Gulf is a hostile act and that the UK is looking to deescalate the crisis.

Parliament  be updated Monmdash Jeremy HuntJuly , On Saturday, Mr Hunt said Iranrsquos actions raised ldquovery serious questions about the security of British and international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.The Foreign Secretary told reporters inside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that, having spoken to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zar, Tehran saw the situation as a ldquotit for tat following the detention of Grace  in Gibraltar.ldquoNothing could be further from the truth, he said.Mr Hunt said MPs would be updated about what ldquofurther measures the Government will take on Monday, adding that the threat level had been raised to three.ldquoOur priority continues to be to find a way to de-escalate the situation.ldquoThatrsquos why I reached out to the Iranian foreign minister, thatrsquos why due process in Gibraltar continues.ldquoWe need to see due process happening in Iran as well, we need to see the illegal seizing of a British flagged vessel reversed, we need that ship released, and we continue to be very concerned about the safety and welfare of the  crew members.The Foreign Office earlier summoned the Iranian charge drsquoaffaires, Mohsen Omidzamani, following the incident.Iran has directly linked the seizure of the vessel with Britainrsquos role in detaining a tanker carrying Iranian oil earlier this month.A spokesman for IranrsquosCouncil was quoted as saying ldquothe rule of reciprocal action is well known in international law and that Tehran made the right decision in the face of an ldquoillegitimate economic war and seizure of oil tankers.The explanation, which contrasts with a suggestion on Friday night that the Stena Impero was ldquoviolating international maritime rules and had collided with a fishing boat, came as the UK Government warned British ships to stay away from the Strait of Hormuz.HMS Montrose, which is patrolling the Persian Gulf to protect shipping, and earlier this month intercepted Iranian patrol boats surrounding another UK-flagged tanker, reportedly arrived minutes too late to prevent the latest incident.A second oil tanker, the Liberian-flagged Mesdar, which is managed by Norbulk Shipping UK, veered off course towards the Iranian coast after it was boarded by armed guards at about .pm on Friday.Communication with the ship was later re-established and the crew were unharmed.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
