This would give Mr Johnson a majority of 92 if the figures turned into a uniform swing on Election night.But the headline figures mask wide variations according to age, gender and personal Brexit leanings.While the Tories command the support of 70 per cent of those who backed Leave in the 2016 referendum, only 15 per cent are planning to back Labour on December 12.The generational ide is also stark: among 18-to-24-year-olds, just 23 per cent are planning to vote Tory, compared to 63 per cent backing Labour. Among the over-65s, a whopping 68 per cent are planning to vote Tory. Only 14 per cent intend to vote Labour. Men are more enthusiastic about Mr Johnson than women, with 50 per cent planning to vote Tory, compared with 40 per cent of women – a split which has been described as ‘Boris’s woman problem’.With Mr Johnson appearing to be on course for a majority, Labour sources say campaign managers loyal to Mr Corbyn are deliberately blocking pro-Remain London MPs Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry – both leadership contenders from the moderate wing – from making TV appearances. Corbynista favourites such as Rebecca Long-Bailey and Laura Pidcock are said to be preferred for the most prestigious media slots instead.         With Mr Johnson appearing to be on course for a majority, Labour sources say campaign managers loyal to Mr Corbyn are deliberately blocking pro-Remain London MPs Sir Keir Starmer (pictured) and Emily Thornberry – both leadership contenders from the moderate wing – from making TV appearancesLabour have reacted to the threat to their ‘red wall’ by vowing to change strategy and concentrate on wooing pro-Leave Labour voters across the Midlands and the North. Northern Labour candidates fear the switch may have come too late, and are furious about the party’s advocacy of a second referendum and support for Remain.They blame a ‘cabal’ of North London party figures, led by Sir Keir and Ms Thornberry, for putting pressure on ‘closet Brexiteer’ Mr Corbyn to appeal to Remain voters.One senior Labour figure defending a Northern seat said last night: ‘We told the party leadership time and time again that this “Made In Islington”, North London pro-Remain policy would cost us dear in the North. Instead, we’ve had what looks like an anti-Brexit strategy cooked up in London where the main enemy is the Liberal Democrats, when here in the North it’s the Tories. It’s been absolutely pathetic leadership from the top.’         Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, walk together in Islington earlier this month. The failure of Jeremy Corbyn to repeat the ‘surge’ of 2017, which destroyed Theresa May’s Commons majority, has unleashed a battle between the hard-Left and moderate wings of the party over who should replace him as leader if Labour crashes to defeat on December 12The source accused Mr Corbyn’s inner circle of a ‘snobby attitude towards the North of England’ and called for a ‘clear-out’ of the leadership office – including key adviser Seumas Milne.But party sources hit back by claiming internal polling now had the Tory lead down to single digits.Joe Twyman, co-founder of Deltapoll, warned the Conservatives that their lead could shrink in the final days of the campaign, saying: ‘The difference between a majority for Theresa May in 2017 and the hung parliament she ended up with was just 75 votes.‘The underlying data still strongly favours the Conservatives, including Boris Johnson’s personal ratings compared to Jeremy Corbyn… (but) the Conservatives will want to guard against complacency while Labour will be hoping for a strong finish and that their supporters, particularly their younger voters, turn out.’lDeltapoll interviewed 1,528 British adults online between November 28 and 30. The data has been weighted to be representative of the British adult population as a whole. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6ecae663c3e41169e8d81efd091653c32a8f8bb/0_189_6201_3721/master/6201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2773b2105842159245b1cac9e558b3aa","title":"david hockney art iphone window on world","story":"When David Hockney discovered he could create works of art on an iPhone, he was excited by the possibilities – and the fact that he could work from the comfort of his bed.The device was the latest piece of technology to fire his imagination. Between 2009 and 2012, Hockney captured changing seasons and fleeting moments from a window of his former home in Yorkshire, first with an iPhone, then an iPad.Now 120 of those images have been selected for a major publication, most of them never having been seen before. Each composition displays Hockney’s trademark palette of vibrant colours. Some are more abstract than others, exploring the interplay of light, a fiery sunset or the arrival of spring. Some look out on to nearby houses. Others focus on changing skies or seasonal blooms and pot plants on a window sill.Bradford-born Hockney, 82, is a painter, draughtsman, printmaker, stage designer and photographer with an endless passion for experimentation. His masterpieces include A Bigger Splash (1967), in which he captured the shimmering sparkle of a turquoise pool under the intense light of the California sky. His interest in technology has included working with Polaroids, fax machines and digital video as well as the iPhone and iPad as tools for painting.Hans Werner Holzwarth, a book designer and editor who collaborated with Hockney on a previous publication, was taken aback when he first saw the images on the artist’s iPhone. He immediately saw the potential of publishing them together, because there are “so many amazing pictures”.Now a vast edition, titled David Hockney: My Window, will be brought out by art book publisher Taschen next month. Holzwarth said that there were many more images than the 120 he chose with the artist.He believes that “pictures should speak for themselves” and – beyond captions which record only the number, the date and whether it is an iPhone or iPad creation – the only text in the book is a brief foreword by the artist.“My Window describes flowers and the sunrise in Bridlington, East Yorkshire,” writes Hockney. “I started on the iPhone in 2009 … there was great advantage in this medium because it’s backlit and I could draw in the dark. I didn’t ever have to get out of bed. Everything I needed was on the iPhone.” He notes, too, that he drew on the iPhone with his thumb and, when the iPad became available, he used a stylus, allowing him to “get more details in”.Forty-four images were created on an iPhone, the rest on an iPad. Holzwarth said a notable difference is that those done with the artist’s thumb display much wider and rougher strokes.He said of the collection: “For me, it’s really the joy of looking out into the world and getting this positive energy.” He pointed to details such as lines of light that burst through a shutter, raindrops on a window and distant lights at night.He described the works as an exploration of the relationship between inside and outside: “It’s opening up our vision, and how we look.”Holzwarth added: “There’s maybe one or two somewhere published in other contexts, but not as a real body of work. It was not exhibited like this … together in a book, that makes it interesting because it has a different narration.“It’s a kind of sketchbook … he’s sketching every day. For him, depicting the world is an ongoing moment. So the iPhone or the iPad is the perfect media for this.”Holzwarth collaborated with the artist on Taschen’s David Hockney: A Bigger Book (2016), the largest volume ever devoted to his art. While surveying works for that volume, he came across the iPhone images. It was a “wow moment”, he recalled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ef4e77e986302ae75a7ef372e2e69d2bb5d62e/0_365_3281_1968/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=571b10f752a4350446d7435b7e192c48","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Wildfires in California, protests in Iraq and Chile, flooding in Venice and Flamengo’s triumph at the Copa Libertadores – the best photography in news, culture and sport from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eed34facd9fe667c31b331e9d8a31c75ed16ceff/0_956_8272_4965/master/8272.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4483322d31acc0157a5c69569b864dde 880w","title":"through your eyes 150 years of stonehenge in pictures","story":"Last year, to celebrate 100 years since Stonehenge was given to the nation, English Heritage asked the public to share their photographs of the monument.

Some of the images are very poignant.

Pitts spent years getting to know Europe’s black populations. The result, part memoir, documentary and travelogue, is a work that reframes Europe from a black perspective.Irenosen Okojie is one of our finest short story writers. Nudibranch (Dialogue) is her second collection and in it her imagination runs riot. Linguistically inventive and always unpredictable, there is an emotional intensity and weirdness to her storytelling that haunts and lingers.In The Confessions of Frannie Langton (Penguin), debut novelist Sara Collins takes the gothic genre by the scruff of the neck and boldly positions a black Jamaican woman as the protagonist in London 200 years ago. It’s a triumph of powerful characterisation melded with suspenseful plotting while also breaking new ground in subverting a familiar genre.In The Brothers York (Allen Lane), Thomas Penn has tracked backwards in time from The Winter King, his glowing biography of the first Tudor king, to Henry VII’s 15th-century predecessors, tackling the grim triangular conflict between Edward IV, his brother the Duke of Clarence and the younger brother who would become Richard III. I admire Penn’s ability to cut through complication while preserving complexity, and deliver to the reader a narrative that is pacey and full of insight. My favourite novel this year is Olive, Again (Viking), by Elizabeth Strout, which follows her spiky heroine into old age. There is nothing cosy about Strout’s books, though they focus on home and family. She is domestic in the way Jane Austen is domestic, and shares much of her wit and grace.Now on the Costa prize shortlist Surge (Chatto) by Jay Bernard is a radical hybrid, a painfully beautiful multigenerational ghost story, a social document, and a hugely important work of political archaeology. It is a raging indictment of this country’s systemic hostility to its black, Asian and ethnic minority population, and the scandalous lack of accountability when this system claims lives. It is a heartbreaking and brilliant book about an ongoing tragedy.In Carolina Setterwall’s Let’s Hope for the Best (Bloomsbury Circus) the protagonist becomes a widow in a moment, a moment that I cannot get out of my head. I feel tremulous admiration for how a work of beauty can exist within a well of violent pain. We should read to explore the width of our humanity. And ultimately, how to expand it.Bari Weiss’s How to Fight Anti-Semitism (Allen Lane) is a history of our collective ignorance of the depths of racism an exploration of how and why so very many people continue to ignore it – or downright propagate it and a primer on how we can, as a species, end it. Weiss writes with clarity and candour. The text is simple and yet powerful.No one needs another recommendation for The Testaments (Chatto) and still I have to say how thrilling it is when a bookmanages to exceed all expectations. How did she manage to make darkness feel so effortless? How did she think to inject humour where no humour should exist? Because she’s Margaret Atwood, and she can do anything.Kevin Wilson’s new novel Nothing to See Here (Ecco) is about 10-year-old twins who burst into flames whenever they become anxious or angry. The fire doesn’t hurt them, but it burns down everything else. The adults who made these children want nothing to do with them, and so a governess is brought in to keep them hidden away. What starts off as an outrageous premise soon feels uncomfortably realistic.I spent the summer marvelling at Linn Ullmann’s Unquiet (WW Norton, translated by Thilo Reinhard) then the rest of the year giving people copies of it. Ullmann, a novelist well known across Scandinavia and still too underrated here, also happens to be the daughter of Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman, and this “novel” (she calls it a novel because she knows the slippery border between autobiography and fiction) is a narration of childhood and its aftermath under the spell and the pressure of parents in thrall to their own brilliance. It’s a brilliant book in so many ways, and not just about family, age, youth, change in a time of such national and international fanfaring of lies it becomes a book about what we make of our life and times, how to narrate truthfully and why truth matters. A read so clear and so still on its surface, one that goes so deep: I found it unputdownable.It’s hard not to sound hyperbolic about Nicole Flattery’s Show Them a Good Time (Bloomsbury Circus), but it has the formidable magnitude of the work of Danielle McLaughlin and Claire-Louise Bennett, no higher praise. A book inspiring deepest gratitude and admiration was Joseph O’Connor’s Shadowplay (Chatto \u0026amp Windus), whose immaculate sentences were engines of the sometimes strange inner and outer reality of Bram Stoker and Henry Irving. Two books just read in proof: Eimear McBride’s Strange Hotel, a load-bearing beam of a book carrying a whole mansion (or possibly hotel) of meaning. It gives you the almost eerie sense of reading a future classic, but is also a novel reaching back into many byways and private roads of world literature. And the overwhelming Swimming in the Dark by Tomasz Jedrowski, a young Polish author who writes rather miraculously in English, of which he has magisterial and frankly, Conradian command.This Is Pleasure by Mary Gaitskill (Serpent’s Tail), is a perfectly weighted, impeccable novella about the fallout of the #MeToo movement. She is so smart. Gaitskill perfectly captures the seductive narcissism and unthinking creepiness of the male character who loses his job and reputation, but does she make him too nice, not powerful enough? Does she fail to describe why the women he angered felt so trapped? Is her female narrator a little masochistic? These are the questions she sets running in your head. It’s not very long. Buy it as a Christmas present for someone you are in love with and you can have a big fight before the pudding is lit.Meanwhile, Ghost Wall by Sarah Moss (Granta) makes me sad for English nationalism - the good sort, I mean. This is a story about a man trying to find his place in a history from which he feels excluded, and the damage he does to those around him. Necessary, timely stuff.Girl, Woman, Other (Hamish Hamilton), the 2019 Booker prize-winning novel and the eighth by Bernardine Evaristo, is not just one of my favourite books of this year, but one of the most insightful books I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. Each chapter tells the tale of 12 vivid and authentic characters, as they navigate life in different eras, while their lives interconnect in numerous ways – through friends and relatives to chance encounters. Many themes are explored through these women’s stories, including feminism, patriarchy, politics, relationships, sexuality and success. In this inspired piece of writing, Evaristo examines the realities and complexities of womanhood in the UK.Assad Or We Burn the Country by Sam Dagher (Little, Brown) is a moving and insightful account of the Syrian civil war – a conflict that has destroyed a country, reshaped the Middle East and destabilised the entire global order. In its quest to survive at all costs, the Assad regime has been willing to devastate its own country and murder hundreds of thousands of its own people. Long before the rise of Isis, when they were faced only by peaceful demonstrators, the Assad family ordered the massacre and destruction of entire towns. The Russians and Iranians were also happy to see Syria burn rather than allow it to escape their clutches. The only ones who could perhaps have put out the flames – the western powers – had already had their fingers burned in Iraq and Libya, and therefore refrained from taking decisive action.The question that was raised in Aleppo and Homs will continue to haunt all of humanity in the coming decades. How to deal with a regime that holds its own people hostage, and cares about nothing except itself? When the Soviet regime faced collapse in the 1980s, the world was saved because the Soviets – despite all their lies and propaganda – still had a residual moral commitment to humanity. In the future we might not be so lucky.Joseph Kanon is not exactly America’s John le Carré, in that he prefers more intimate moral dilemmas rather than the majesty of the grand game of espionage, but le Carré’s audience will surely appreciate him. He has an astonishing talent for revealing character, age, type and even appearance through dialogue alone. The Accomplice (Simon \u0026amp Schuster) concerns the hunt for a Nazi hiding in Argentina – and what to do with him when captured.The Source of Self-Regard (Alfred Knopf) by Toni Morrison. We lost this literary and cultural titan in August, but she left us with this final non-fiction missive in February (did she know the end was coming? She must have). It’s a rumination on history, black culture and her own work, and a fitting epilogue to her extraordinary life.With an honourable mention for Me (Macmillan), Elton John’s autobiography – candid, hilarious and not at all what a celeb bio is expected to be.Cartoonist Kim Deitch all but invented literary comic fiction more than 50 years ago. Before the term “graphic novel” existed, he set forth on a concerted series of interconnected stories and books that joyfully strain time, space and the reader’s credulity. His grab-you-by-the-shoulders yarns glow on the page, patiently laid down with a steady brush and a monkish dedication to “time served” – hours that he’s regularly noted in the margins of his original art, clocking in at least 40 a week since the Nixon administration. His dedication shows he has created one of the most complex, sprawling, strange and great ongoing works of American art – in any medium – of the last century. The latest volume in his universe is Reincarnation Stories (Fantagraphics), and it’s one of his very best, connecting (among others) Jesus, the Felix-like critical cartoon cat “Waldo” he’s been drawing for decades, forgotten western film actors to, somehow, “Kim Deitch” himself. At 75 years old, that he’s able to make the unimaginable seeable is only slightly more impressive than the fact he works harder and is creating more vibrant and exciting work than other graphic novelists half his age.In children’s and YA books, Bearmouth by Liz Hyder (Pushkin) has remained with me since I read it almost a year ago. A strange, uncompromising and innovative novel written in dialect, set in a mine where workers are promised riches in the next life. It put me in mind of Iain Banks’s The Wasp Factory with its unnerving otherworldliness, but is its own thing entirely.In adult fiction, highlights were Follow Me to Ground by Sue Rainsford, an earthy, folkloric debut that slips through genres like a snake shedding its skin and The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead. Written in economical yet vivid prose, this is a brutal and beautiful account of boys living, and dying, in a reform school in the 60s. It speaks absolutely to the moment and is a lesson in restraint.I loved George Packer’s Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century (Cape). Fiction can inhabit people, give the out-from-the-eyes view, because it’s made up. With non-fiction it’s harder. Rarely in recent years has a work of non-fiction so clearly, ruthlessly, compassionately shown such a prominent person’s life from the inside out. It is a masterwork about diplomacy, government and the world, but it is mostly a chance, as Packer writes, to “ogle ambition in the nude”.Jia Tolentino, meanwhile, was on the money with Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion (4th Estate). The book isn’t framed this way, but to me it was one of the best looks at capitalism I’ve read in years. Tolentino doesn’t analyse capitalism-as-capitalism. She investigates questions such as why chopped-salad chains are spreading, and comes to insightful conclusions such as that chopped salad is the perfect optimised food for people driven to ever-accelerating productivity, because you can eat it without looking down from your computer, fork to leaf to mouth, fork to leaf to mouth. She is funny, wise and well on her way to being one of our best chroniclers.This has been a year of marvels for poetry. Debuts have been magnificent, from the poised and poignant coming-of-age poems in Mary Jean Chan’s Flèche (Faber) to Jay Bernard’s raging, grieving Surge (Chatto).Game-changers have included the always revolutionary Kei Miller’s unsettling fourth collection, In Nearby Bushes (Carcanet), which inscribes the liminal, dangerous night space of “nearby bushes  nearby bruises”. Layered with Jamaican folk etymologies, erasures and palimpsests of violence, this book is a radical excavation of vulnerability and the unseen.I loved Julia Copus’s blue jewel of a book Girlhood (Faber), which conjures a terrifying, wolfish stepfather, the cock-profanities of a wire-bearded, lecherous classics tutor, and mornings spent shoplifting in a glossy department store with Copus’s hallucinogenically forensic attention to detail.Lastly, I fell hard for Ilya Kaminsky’s Deaf Republic(Faber). Part folklore, fable, war story and love poem, it imagines an occupied town falling deaf in response to the shooting of a child. Often devastating, always humane, this is a book of the century, let alone this year. And top of my Christmas list? Sharon Olds’s Arias (Cape Poetry). Olds is a supreme poet of the body and the intimate, loving, suffering, human life I will be reading her (and wishing I could write like her) till I die.Assuming you read Surge by Jay Bernard, Deaf Republic by Ilya Kaminsky and After the Formalities by Anthony Anaxagorou (Penned in the Margins), here are three books you may have missed – Afterwardness by Mimi Khalvati, an entire book of sonnets. So much fine-tuned mastery from Khalvati really deserves more attention from us. Epiphaneia by Richard Georges, at a time when we can’t ignore our changing climate, what better voices to reach for than the survivors of natural disasters? Georges and his family survived Hurricane Irma when it hit their home in the British Virgin Islands, there’s a lot of turbulence and precision in Georges’s stanzas. Lastly, Witch by Rebecca Tamás (Penned in the Margins) takes place in a Victorian courtroom and is witty, daring and viscerally lyrical.I’ve discovered, rather late, the work of Wright Thompson, a senior writer for ESPN magazine. His essay collection The Cost of These Dreams (Blink) proves that the best sports writing is never about sport, but the human condition. He writes vividly about things I didn’t see but wish I had done.I greatly admire the poetry of Philip Larkin and also the writing of Clive James (I would buy his laundry list if it was stuck between hard covers). So James’s collected writings on Larkin, Somewhere Becoming Rain (Picador), was devoured whole on the very day it arrived. Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands isn’t only the best memoir of the year it’s the best for a decade at least. And I am still thinking – three months after I finished it – about that small, cruelly savage world that Colson Whitehead’s The Nickel Boys got trapped in.Oliver Jeffers’s children’s books are always gorgeous and whimsical with a depth and humour that keep his devotees hanging on for the next tale. With The Fate of Fausto (HarperCollins) the Belfast authorartist conjures a modern fable that feels a thousand years old while also sadly relevant to modern times. Proud Fausto boasts that he is the master of all he observes including nature itself and sets out on a journey to survey and subjugate everything in his domain. Unfortunately for him, his pride will be his undoing. I love that this story can be read and enjoyed on different levels. The prose is spare and considered, and the art is wonderful and evocative. This is a book that will bear dozens of readings and ring true every time.The Lammisters by Declan Burke is a rip-roaring crash though the looking glass crime novel set in Hollywood. Burke turns comedy tropes on their heads in the most entertaining romp through the 1920s that I have ever chuckled my way through. Irish bootlegger Rusty McGrew goes on the lam with Vanessa Hopgood pursued by a rogue’s gallery of ne’er do wells and amorous suitors. This rapid-fire novel deserves a place on any bookshelf that grants asylum to PG Wodehouse, Flann O’Brien or Kyril Bonfiglioli.A Boy and His Dog at the End of the World (Orbit) is a beautiful SF novel from CA Fletcher that asks how far we are willing to go for those we love. When a beloved pet is stolen, her owner sets out from an isolated community to find her. There’s something here for everyone – dog lover or not.Annalee Newitz is known for co-founding science and technology website io9, and her debut, Autonomous (Orbit), was one of the most intelligent and sharply political novels of 2018. Her second novel was published this year, The Future of Another Timeline, and features time-travelling intersectional feminists on a mission to stop the rogue editing of history. What more can you ask for from your science fiction?James Meek’s novel To Calais, in Ordinary Time (Canongate) is a true masterpiece. Every sentence is beautifully turned, like an exquisite detail on a 14th-century reredos. Some pages are so finely crafted that I read them over and again, taking delight in the texture of each word. Set in England in 1348, told by three voices, in three half-languages, it recounts the story of flight from the strictures of village life and towards the approaching Black Death. The novel is unsettling and strange, crawling with dread and muted horror, breaking out in feverish humours. I felt bereft whenever I put it down, and for nights after I had finished it dreamt new endings to the story.I loved Nigel Slater’s Greenfeast for springsummer, so I leapt on its new companion, Greenfeast (HarperCollins) for autummwinter. It is full of winter warmers, roasted roots, warm spices and cheese. As with its predecessor, you want to cook everything in it, and when you do cook, the recipes work. The books are small, cloth-bound affairs, which means a flexible sturdy spine. The cover designs are great. But most of all, Nigel Slater is a wonderful cook and a terrific writer. His recipes are not poncey and pretentious, his writing is light, interesting and rings true – you know he really loves cooking and glories in great ingredients.With The Whole Fish (Hardie Grant), Josh Niland has revolutionised the way we think about, and treat, fish. Nose to tail cooking, when it comes to animals, has been commonplace since humans started eating meat. So why has it taken so long for us to treat fish in the same way? In this eye-opening book, Niland teaches us not only how to cure and preserve fish, just as we do meat (think moonfish belly bacon and swordfish prosciutto), but also explains how he uses every little bit of every fish in his pioneering restaurant and fish butchery in Sydney. From the eyeballs and swim bladders (which he makes crisps out of), throats (which he deep fries), sperm sacks (which he treats like sweetbreads), blood (which he turns into blood pudding), bones (which he pulverizes to enhance stocks) to all the remaining scraps (which he turns into garums). Niland has cleverly devised uses for parts that are usually thrown away without a second thought, inspiring not only chefs, but also fishing industries around the world.• To order these titles go to bookshop.

She is half-French and half-Cumbrian and grew up in London with her father, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. She wrote her debut novel, Towards Mellbreak, in 2017. Her forthcoming book, Sleeping Letters, is a memoir addressed to both her parents about her mother, Marie-Elisabeth Roche, who took her own life when Marie-Elsa was six years old. The book is written – in part – as a series of unsent letters to her mother and father. It is also a description of the ritual of the eucharist.What was the starting point for Sleeping Letters?I was commissioned to write another novel but I went into a silent retreat and this is what came out. I thought, Well, I’ve just got to do this. I didn’t know if I wanted my editor to see it but then they kept asking and I felt there was something universal about what I was writing. I’ve watched so many people go through grief now, and I’ve also done a lot of funerals, and there really is no shame to suffering. It’s actually quite beautiful. If you allow yourself to still love, even when you’ve had incredible grief, then all of you comes through it somehow.You write in the book that you would like to tell your mother that she has always been with you “like a scent”. But you say you have often turned away from her “from fear of what happened”. What made you turn back?Love. It’s got to be love. And defiantly refusing to accept that pain can be the end of the story. It’s more than hope, it’s a refusal to let the difficult things have the last word. There’s something about getting older that means you have a longer view about what forgiveness is and how we really heal. It is often the case that people find it easier to give forgiveness than to receive it.The form of Sleeping Letters is unusual – it’s a memoir made up of prose, poetry, religious reflections and letters. You call it a confession – why?Because it was written in the ritualistic atmosphere of a silent retreat. But there’s also something about facing my own pain, which has to be a confession about the things I irrationally believe I’ve done wrong. We all collude somehow in even the most difficult situations because we don’t know what to do. But I feel very different having written the book – it was a question of confessing that pain to myself. I know it’s there and I feel ready to bite on it now.You have said that writing the book has been very cathartic. In what ways?When you live with grief, you can hide parts of yourself from yourself and often those parts are the ones longing to see that person again. We often just don’t know what to do with them, so they’re just stored. Living with unanswered questions can feel like you’re holding your breath because you don’t have the other person answering them. But even in a relationship with someone who is alive, we don’t fully understand how we are encountering each other. I was able to go through that pain threshold to talk to both my parents.Has your father read Sleeping Letters?Yes, he read it in the summer. I felt a mixture of nervousness and also so much love. Everything I have possibly found from my soul to give to my parents is in the book. It’s something he’s never been able to hear and is continually tortured by.I genuinely wrote it to both of them in the hope I could say: “Hey, I’m your daughter and this is what I’ve found and I have the courage to speak to you now.” It was very emotional when he read it, but what’s nice is that over the last couple of months, he’s reading it again and beginning to find it healing. He’s 80 years old and seeing dear friends die so I really wanted to be able to give it to him.When I was reading your book, I had both Frieda Hughes and Emily Berry in mind, two poets whose mothers took their own lives and have written about that loss. Did their poetry give you a confidence to write about your mother?I do feel that there is a really interesting movement of women poets now, Emily Berry being one of them, where we are feeling a freedom of being able to talk in whatever form is natural to us. We’re neither feeling conformed by a sonnet nor so rebellious that we never write anything like that. So I was able to take the eucharist, which in its history has been deeply patriarchal in its structure and in its manner of use and breathe with authenticity without feeling ashamed of being a woman. I feel very companioned with poets such as Emily Berry and Alice Oswald.Which book or author do you always return to?Mrs Dalloway, because it has this web of reality in it that I find comforting and such delicately drawn characters. You have layers upon layers of Woolf’s sense that we are all affecting each other whether we know it or not. It’s funny, when you are duty chaplin at Westminster Abbey, you go and live there for one or two weeks a year. Having always been obsessed with Mrs Dalloway, I thought what a lark to be sleeping near Big Ben! But by 11pm when it chimed, I thought: “Oh my God, I’m never going to sleep!”You’re an Anglican priest. How do you balance your clerical duties with being creative?I find the craft of priesthood deeply creative. I’m about to write a sermon for the church I work with in Golders Green and I have to have an intuitive sense of what that congregation needs. You meet people who have made terrible mistakes or are in terrible trouble and may never get out of it but they can be inspiring. Pastoral love is very real to me.• Sleeping Letters by Marie-Elsa Bragg is published by Vintage (£12.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Can you suggest any other authors to try? Anonymous, 37, Alberta, CanadaAlex Preston, author and Observer critic, writes:Well now, I have to say that my first instinct here is somewhat mutinous. Haven’t upper-middle-class Americans rather had their time in the literary sun? There’s a whole world out there, you know.So what about something from the trailblazing Cassava Republic Press, a publisher of extraordinary, mind-expanding books from Africa? I’d recommend in particular A Small Silence, the superb debut novel from the Nigerian poet Jumoke Verissimo.Or how about Alia Trabucco Zerán’s The Remainder, published by And Other Stories and translated by Sophie Hughes? This deeply compelling excavation of the crimes of Pinochet’s Chile has gained new urgency now tyranny has once again reared its head in the country.But if you insist on Americans in the FranzenTartt mould, how about looking back a generation to the greats such as James Salter, William Maxwell and (the slightly younger) Marilynne Robinson?Or what about the remarkable Olive and Lucy Barton novels by Elizabeth Strout? I didn’t entirely see what the fuss was about until her most recent, Olive, Again, which left me speechless with admiration.To my mind, though, the best contemporary American novelist of middle-class mores by some distance is one who happens to live in England: Benjamin Markovits . You Don’t Have to Live Like This is one of the essential books of the past 10 years – breathtakingly clever, hugely entertaining and a powerful commentary on the financial crisis and its aftermath. His recent Essinger novels – A Weekend in New York and Christmas in Austin – are also glorious, showing us that America will always be best perceived through the prism of the family, and that, as Hemingway knew, sometimes you have to leave a place to understand it.Submit your question for book clinic below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afd28dbe157b0d025f9dd45d5cf0bccb7f83a5ec/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec3f73fabe2209bed3c60e7809754824","title":"quiz are you a born adventurer","story":" Everyone likes to think they’ve got an adventurous side … who hasn’t dreamed of escaping the everyday and taking on a new challenge?

And the British women we spoke to are indulging themselves, guilt-freeI’d be lying if I said I’d been looking forward to my 40s. Before the big birthday rolled around, I’d defined this decade as old. Boring. I was wrong. Speaking to other fortysomething women, I realised this is the time to forget about guilty pleasures. Here, we’re celebrating all out, straight-up pleasures. Some are everyday. Some are extravagant. They share one important theme: experiences over things equals enjoyment.‘I treated myself to a bike that’s turned me superhuman’Sarah Emslie, 41, osteopath, EdinburghI caught myself saying “I’m having a midlife crisis” to the guy in the bike shop and I kicked myself, because it’s nonsense. If I want to blow four figures on a super-fast aerodynamic time trial bike then I should celebrate. We don’t need to apologise for having fun. Racing head down, number on my back, I feel superhuman. I love how clear my head feels speeding downhill at 60km an hour. My favourite moments are when my wife, Laura, rides ahead of me, so I can take in the view of the mountains with her zooming down. I’m faster over the course than I was last year. It’s exhilarating to be 41 and still get better at your sport. I don’t feel my age. I don’t feel anything except that I’m me.‘I just enjoy being in a creative space’Helena Smith, 41, psychologist, KentThere are many hoops to jump through to get out of the house, especially because I’m a single mum, but my Tuesday life drawing class is worth it. I don’t give two monkeys about being good at sketching I just enjoy being in a creative space where I don’t think about work or bills or the stress of being a working mum because I’m so in the moment. Taking time out forces you into a different mindset. It’s been years since I did anything creative like this, because when you have babies it’s nearly impossible to do anything for yourself. During the two-hour class, time disappears completely. It’s my ultimate indulgence, because it’s purely for myself – nobody else’s benefit.‘Reading all morning is my ultimate indulgence’Minhe Currier, 41, stay-at-home mum, SurreyIf I don’t get time to myself I just don’t function. It’s not even an indulgence, it’s a sanity issue. As a married mother of a six-year-old, I automatically put myself last. But after the school drop-off, I open a book and read. In my 20s and 30s all I did was work. I was a broker in the city, starting work at 6.30am, leaving at 7pm and coming home without the emotional energy to read anything at all. Now I’m really into non-fiction because I’ve discovered life is much stranger than anything an author can make up. Recently I’ve read Harriet Harman’s autobiography, A Woman’s Work, which I think is good enough to rival Michelle Obama’s Becoming. Harman was a big childcare campaigner and reinforced the idea that parents are better people when they have their own lives. I couldn’t agree more.‘I get excited about an early night’Rhiannon Evans, 48, surveyor, CardiffI’m happier after a big sleep, and my skin looks happier, too. I get excited about an early night. I crave sleep and dream about my duvet during a rough day at work. I’m in bed by 10pm and I fall asleep quickly, often while I’m reading, but perimenopausal hormonal mayhem means I’m often awake for two or three hours in the middle of the night. It doesn’t help that my kids, aged 18 and 21, keep totally different hours to mine. At the weekend I might sleep until 10am, which is bliss.‘I never thought high street pasta could feel so extravagant’Zohreh Ghaffari, 48, radiographer, LondonIs it boring that my ultimate indulgence is eating pasta alle vongole until I can’t breathe? Add a nice glass of wine and finish up with chocolate and I’m a happy woman. In my 20s I ate out a lot without really thinking about it. Now going out for dinner is a mission: we need to book a babysitter and there are lots of stars that have to align workwise, because my husband and I both do shifts in different hospitals. But because we eat out so rarely, it feels special when we do. Sometimes we even have a random day off midweek together, so we treat ourselves and go for pasta on the high street while the kids are at school. That feels like a real indulgence.Beauty is ageless.

Her brush with death led to subsequent time spent in rehab – and a very earnest 11-month-long hewing to Alcoholics Anonymous sobriety. During this time she decided to write a book inspired by the incident – and by her complex relationship with her mother, Debbie Reynolds.She named that book Postcards From the Edge.Carrie opened the book with the line: “Maybe I shouldn’t have given the guy who pumped my stomach my phone number, but who cares?” She ended it with a letter to that same lifesaving doctor, concluding with witty melancholy: “That night in the emergency room, do you recall if I threw up something I needed? ... I distinctly feel as though I’m missing something.” Pause. “But then, I always have.”Carrie used her real post-rehab experiences in the book. She transformed her desperation work on the director Penelope Spheeris’s low-budget undercover-cop movie Hollywood Vice Squad into her character Suzanne Vale’s desperation work on a low-budget undercover cop film called The Kitchen Sink. As in Carrie’s real life, Suzanne Vale takes the cheesy role because she thought that, given her drug history, she’d never work again.Readers would come to know Carrie, the glib and the profound in its own lively mix. They would get the cynical social critic: “You can’t find any true closeness in Hollywood because everybody does fake closeness so well.” And the standard-issue neurotic: “My problem is, I only know how to need needy people ... Somebody ... could be wearing a sign, ‘I have no problems, you can believe me,’ and I wouldn’t even see them.” The soon-to-be-very-famous over-sharer: “But deep down – and you don’t get too far deep down with me, because I’ve thrust all the deep down right up to the surface.” The sociologist: “I guess that’s how guys are thoughtful in the eighties – they accompany girls to their abortions.”Some of this is Carrie-shtick, but it’s winning and smart and not hollow. The book ends with Suzanne Vale being driven to the hospital by the decent Jesse for treatment after burning her hand while making waffles. “I should open up a house account here,” she says of the venue she was taken to after her overdose. Jesse admits, “They should at least give you a quantity discount.” Suzanne Vale amuses us while her angst feels genuine. We envy her blasé worldliness, but the pain that’s its price makes it safe not to be jealous of her.The book’s debut was helped by felicitous rave blurbs from Carrie’s friends. “Carrie’s book is savagely funny and savagely revealing. It makes Moby Dick look like a big, fat, dumb book,” said Steve Martin. Candice Bergen said, “This is a remarkable first novel. In fact, it is a remarkable second novel.”There was excitement at Simon \u0026amp Schuster during the copy-editing of Postcards, gearing up to its August 1987 publication. “It was such a unique book,” said the – tragically recently deceased – Susan Kamil, who was the editor toward the book’s completion (and later became publisher of Random House and Dial Press). “The intelligence, the transparency – the voice was the voice of a real person. It was the beginning of Carrie Fisher being a centrifugal force,” she says. “The combination of celebrity and honesty was so new.” Indeed, it would not be until years later that female Hollywood insiders wrote tartly about the industry: Julia Phillips’s You’ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again came out in 1991, Lynda Obst’s Hello, He Lied in 1996, Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters’s Hit and Run in 1996. And, for that matter, Peter Biskind’s Easy Riders, Raging Bulls wasn’t published until 1998.The rave reviews for Postcards were kicked off by the novelist, memoirist, and third-generation Los Angeles native Carolyn See, who provided it with one of the first of many happily stunned reviews. See seemed to be thinking out loud as she expressed her intrigue with and lack of preparation for Carrie the writer:Everyone knows Carrie Fisher for her portrait of Princess Leia in the film Star Wars, and all those other movies. And everyone knows her royal Hollywood lineage: the daughter of Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds. And no doubt lots of readers will buy Postcards From the Edge because of those facts, and all the promotional fallout that comes from them.But a couple of things come to mind when you get about 50 pages into Postcards From the Edge. You wonder, thinking back, why Carrie Fisher – why she didn’t grab your mind as you watched the screen, the way her mother did. And it occurs to you, Carrie Fisher’s heart might not have been in it. You deduce this fact because her heart appears to be in this novel and in the writing process. This book is so much better than you think it’s going to be! It’s intelligent, original, focused, insightful, very interesting to read.In another paragraph See wrote, “This is not an inspirational novel, but something on the order of a tough look at reality a ‘serious’ piece of work.”The Washington Post called Postcards “a cult classic . . . a wonderfully funny, brash, and biting novel, the most startling literary debut since Jay McInerney’s Bright Lights, Big City”.There would come comparisons to Erica Jong, Nora Ephron, and Joan Didion, and to Bret Easton Ellis, Hunter S Thompson, her role model Dorothy Parker, David Sedaris, Augusten Burroughs, and Martin Amis.The book launch took place in New York, with a party at the S\u0026ampS executive Joni Evans’s apartment. During a pre-party interview with The New York Times’s Michael Gross, a merry, antic Carrie “bounced into the bathroom to fuss with her hair for the fourth time in 10 minutes” and did not fail to give great, honest Carrie quotations – about the allure of drugs and her late friend John Belushi, about skipping the snide for the wryly confessional. It was Eddie’s fifty-ninth birthday, and he was attending the party that night. Ever the father-helping daughter, she had bought him a present: a jacket and pants. Gross left the interview “thinking she was hysterically funny and I left there thinking I had just met somebody extraordinary”, Gross says.“Most children wait for their parents to die before writing such a book,” Mansfield noted. “Boy, when they die,” Carrie lobbed back, “I’m gonna come out with a sitcom.”When they got to the Mexican restaurant and two tables were offered and rejected until a third is chosen, she quipped to the waiter: “This is the most moving, moving experience.”Mansfield wrote: “She worries that therapy is her only serious relationship …About a year ago, after therapy by men, she found a woman shrink.” To which Carrie riposted, “Next, I’m going to go for an 11-year-old child.” Who else talked like that? Carrie’s earlier print interviews had a hint of who Carrie was, but now her unique personality was in full force.Carrie embarked on an eight-city tour for Postcards’s publication, and Gary Springer – son of the well-known publicist John Springer (who had had Debbie and Richard Burton among his many clients) – accompanied her as a publicistminder. “She brought her Bumble and Bumble hairdresser with her because she felt the only way she could feel different at every event was to have a different hairstyle,” Springer recalls. Because of the daily washing and setting, she had T-shirts printed “Bald by Frisco” and distributed them to her team.But in the behind-the-scenes portion of the tour, Carrie’s vulnerability, which had been evident throughout her wry, wisecracking life, was very much in the fore. Carrie had so much stage fright before every appearance that Springer would spend “the entire day or morning before the event in the hotel bathroom with her. I was sitting on the edge of the tub while she was on the floor, wrapped around the toilet: throwing up. She was so nervous. But then she would go out to the event and she was absolutely delightful – buoyant and energetic, smiling and bubbly. And she wanted every event and presentation to be different than the previous day’s. And they were.”From that point on – her great performance anxiety notwithstanding – Carrie, at 31, had a new identity that would flourish over her personal screen adaptation of Postcards for Mike Nichols, and seven additional books and a self-written, greatly adored one-woman play. She also became one of the best and most in-demand script doctors in Hollywood. She – rightfully – thought of herself now not as an actress who wrote but as a writer who acted. Recounting – in a style she called “faction” (fact plus fiction) the details of her life – with a searing, hilarious honesty that relieved other “imperfect” women and had a healing quality (among other things, when she admitted her bipolar disorder and told the world, “I am mentally ill I can say that,” she destigmatized the disorder throughout America) – came to the fore. It was perhaps or more than perhaps what she did best.Acting, even as Princess Leia, was never dismissed (indeed, she was grateful to her character Leia and all that it brought her), but it was secondary. Carrie Fisher was a writer, and a never-stopping worker: like her mother Debbie Reynolds, “unsinkable.” And the fact that she could do all of this despite the ever-rearing dual challenges of bipolar disorder and an inherited propensity to drug addiction made her all the more admirable. As it does today.Excerpted from Carrie Fisher: A Life on the Edge, by Sheila Weller, published by Sarah Crichton Books, an imprint of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 12 November 2019.

Once a rowdy lumber town, it quietly developed into one of the country’s most handsome and liveable cities federal money backed impressive architecture and still supports a rash of top-flight national museums, while careful planning kept the city centre walkable and put the great outdoors a mere 15-minute drive away. There’s also a sizeable gastro and brewpub scene, along with a packed festival calendar. And there’s an appetite for some unusual activities too: how about the weekly mass drop-in yoga sessions on the parliament’s iconic lawns, or ice-skating the Rideau canal – the world’s largest rink – in the very centre of the city with a BeaverTail pastry in hand? See it for yourself …Food and drink form a big part of the Ottawa lifestyle. Farmers’ markets always bustle and hot new restaurants continually pop up around a city that already boasts the full range of choices, including dozens of ethnic eateries in districts such as Chinatown. Try the classic French cuisine at Sur Lie, or the innovative menus at Stofa. Elsewhere, the emphasis is often on casual and healthy, with modern vegetarian places such as Pure Kitchen as popular as any. Ottawa’s microbreweries all thrive too, with craft ales universally loved: the city’s beer festivals, such as the Winter Brewfest in February or the Ottawa Beerfest in June, burst at the seams brewery bus tours thrive and getting a table at a hip beer-focused restaurant, such as Bar Lupulus can be a challenge. Alongside the award-winning chefs and popular eateries is the much-loved BeaverTails pastry stand: its speciality is a huge doughnut flattened into the shape of a beaver’s tail then smothered with a topping. Barack Obama made sure he got one when he visited as president in 2009.Tours of Ottawa’s gothic parliament buildings are not to be missed you can visit both the House of Commons and the new Senate to observe democracy in action. The city’s national museums are another strongpoint, partly for their distinctly Canadian twist. From reconstructed polar environments to birch-bark canoes and contemporary art, all provide a wonderful window on the nation.The Canadian Museum of History has a particularly insightful glut of historical artefacts, including an extraordinary totem pole collection. For greater insights into today’s Canadian culture try the National Gallery of Canada, where airy contemporary art displays steal the show from old masters. Better still, take in a show at the dynamic National Arts Centre, whose bilingual performing arts programme includes all sorts of music, dance and theatre. Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot appears in November and the NAC English Theatre has highlights of Prince Hamlet, Angelique and The Pigeon King early next year.Ottawa has a reputation for a dramatic climate, based on temperatures that swing between –30C and +30C and, no matter the weather, the city excels at making the most of the outdoors all year round.An extraordinary 500-mile network of cycle paths, many groomed for skiing in winter, is a key asset and with many being attractive riverside affairs, getting about by bike is often the best way to see the city.Otherwise, the Gatineau Hills are the main destination for summer hiking and biking, while in winter they support one of Canada’s premier cross-country skiing networks, as well as good snowshoeing to remote cabins and some downhill skiing at Camp Fortune. All this is nicely rounded off by the Nordik Spa-Nature with its medley of rustic saunas, hot tubs, treatments and massages.Avoiding Ottawa’s January and February extremes might seem wise, but then you’d miss all the fun of the February Winterlude festival – a carnival of ice sculpting, canal skating and BeaverTail bingeing. Instead, don’t worry about the temperatures – Ottawa always seems to take the climate in its stride.Take to the river in the summer months you can go white-water rafting on the Ottawa River. The city is also the master of the big occasion and leads the nation’s Canada Day celebrations on 1 July. Otherwise, there really are festivals on every week so there’s no bad time to visit.Discover all Ottawa has to offer for your next trip with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b01852cd6aae501b9a7a0f6881ca5b641a7cea/0_547_4468_2681/master/4468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ca1ced722ec13311a41a1f72aba1a5a","title":"danish bacon what happens when you push pigs to the absolute limit","story":"Denmark’s industrial pig farms are stunningly productive, but there is another side to their successLast year, Ole Kjaer was the number one pig farmer in Denmark. Unsurprisingly, in the land of Danish bacon, this is a pretty hotly contested award.The biggest factor in his high profit rate? The astonishing productivity of his pigs. Each of Kjaer’s sows produces an average of 41 piglets a year.In the UK, the average sow produces 25.8 pigs a year. In the US that number rises to 26.4. But in Denmark, the world’s laboratory for industrial pig farming, the average sow produces 33.3 piglets – and some farmers, like Kjaer, manage to push that figure even higher. Some believe that one day they could even reach the magic number of 50.The government has previously backed plans to double the country’s yearly production from approximately 28 million to 56 million. “I am ready to welcome the aim of producing twice as many pigs in Denmark if we can handle both animal welfare and the environment. The government has sent a clear signal that we will develop agriculture for precision farming with a lower environmental impact,” said the then minister for environment and food Esben Lunde Larsen on a visit to a slaughterhouse in Jutland run by Danish Crown, the world’s largest pork exporter, last year.The results look, on the surface, pretty good. Each year Danish Crown – owned by Danish pig farmers – sends nearly 2m tonnes of pig meat to 127 different countries around the world, bringing in more than €3bn.Meanwhile, the leading Danish pig-breeding company, DanBred, sells its technology around the world, with an office on nearly every continent. The company boasted an enhancement of €2,17 on average per slaughter pig per year during 2017. “The largest genetic gain ever realised”, they called it. Sow deaths are usually due to lameness and leg problems, but when the animals are found dead pig producers often cannot state the cause of death. Even with an autopsy, almost a third of the causes of death are unresolved.The DAFC said the number of sows being replaced may be due to genetic improvements, fertility failures and the structure of the herd, and cannot be interpreted as sows being culled for welfare reasons. “Denmark has a central and precise system that registers and collects all dead sows. In most other countries dead animals are destroyed at local facilities without being registered. Therefore, it makes very little sense to compare mortality between countries. In addition to that, regulations on fitness for transport of animals are substantially stricter in Denmark compared to for instance Spain, the US, Canada and France, Japan. That means fewer sows in Denmark are allowed to be taken to slaughter, but instead are being put down at the farm,” said a DAFC spokesperson.The DAFC disputes the suggestion that piglet deaths could be an unavoidable side-effect of increasing the size of litters beyond the 14 piglets the sow normally is able to feed. It said that when there are more piglets than teats, extra milk is provided and the surplus piglets are moved to nursing sows.According to research centre Seges, part of the Danish Agriculture and Food Council, there can be more challenges: “Unfortunately, it is often difficult to determine what has made the pig weak. It can be a viral infection such as influenza or PRRS, prolonged farrowing or sub-supply of nutrients in the latter part of pregnancy.”“The pressure on the sows for ever-increasing production is sky high. It is a short rough life with no consideration for the animals’ natural needs and natural biology. In terms of animal welfare it is really a race to the bottom,” adds Riis.The strategy of the Danish Agriculture and Food Council is to allow the Danish pig producers themselves to set the direction to raise the level of pig welfare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c09c7d1f3589efbf1070d08e82db5479b4728695/0_85_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfb4d18578999afd78014d8462804696","title":"eight foot whale found washed up on thames shore","story":"The minke whale was discovered on Friday by a patrol boat under Battersea BridgeAn eight-foot whale washed up on the shore of the Thames yesterday, where it was found by a patrol boat under Battersea Bridge.The minke whale was found on Friday evening at about 10pm by a Port of London Authority boat, but it is not yet known how it got there or why it died.The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) are set to undertake a postmortem examination to determine the cause of death.According to Rob Deaville, who leads an investigation project into the stranding of cetacean creatures at the ZSL, the mammal is the 27th minke whale to be washed up in the UK this year.It is believed to be the third beaching of a dead whale on the Thames in two months, after a humpback whale and an endangered sei whale washed up separately in October.Deaville said it was “too early to speculate” on why the whale had died, but that the organisation were not ruling out unnatural causes such as collisions with ships or injuries from fishing equipment, alongside natural causes.Minke whales, which can weigh up to 10 tonnes, are the most common bathing whale in UK waters.

We are on a plump sofa and behind us a man fills the space with a loud video call, unaware that earphones have been invented. He is, obviously, irritating, but Mbatha-Raw’s only concern is that he will drown out the Dictaphone. She is somewhat stately and casual herself, laughing whenever she says something that she thinks might sound pretentious. Earnestness is spiked with self-awareness. “I’d never want to assume that I have some greater wisdom,” she says with a grin.There is an alertness about Mbatha-Raw, just as there is on screen: almost all of her characters are on some sort of mission. As the real-life biracial girl born into slavery but raised by the aristocracy in 2013’s Belle – the actor’s big-screen breakthrough – her combination of innocence and steeliness charmed many. Oprah Winfrey was a huge supporter of the film, while Prince – actual Prince – performed at an afterparty he arranged for the premiere.Since Belle, she has done the lot. On stage, she was a bawdy bundle of fun as the titular flower-seller-turned-royal sweetheart Nell Gwynn at Shakespeare’s Globe in London. On screen, she has done genre drama (The Cloverfield Paradox, Fast Color) and – with Joe Swanberg’s excellent improvised Netflix series Easy – she was understated and heartbreaking as a woman indecisively returning to a broken relationship. Then there is the fantastical tomfoolery: Ava DuVernay’s A Wrinkle in Time (with Oprah), Beauty and the Beast (she was the feather duster), and the Wachowskis’ bewildering space opera Jupiter Ascending, in which she played a half-human, half-deer creature called Famulus (it’s worth Googling for her ears).She is perhaps best known for San Junipero, widely regarded as the best and most beloved episode of Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror. She played Kelly, fighting mortality in the real world while partying it up in a virtual, artificially created alternate reality. Her character was desperately in love with life, and Mbatha-Raw’s performance too was joy personified. The episode was acclaimed for treating the same-sex relationship at its centre with an optimism and lightness of touch, and Kelly and Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis) swiftly became queer icons. “I didn’t think about it culturally,” says Mbatha-Raw of her initial response to the script. “I just thought: ‘Wow, I love this story. I have to do it.’”She is, though, “thrilled” at the impact it has had and loves working on material that breaks down cultural barriers – as San Junipero did, as Belle did, as the recent black skinhead drama Farming did. There is also next year’s Misbehaviour, set around 1970’s Miss World competition, in which she plays Jennifer Hosten, the first woman of colour to win the event. That year, women’s liberation movement activists stormed the stage on live television. They swung football rattles as the host Bob Hope did his shtick, before hurling rotten fruit, flour and smoke bombs all over the shop.Much of Mbatha-Raw’s work speaks to a worldview formed early on: she was born in Oxford in 1983 to a black South African doctor and a white British nurse. “My parents are from different countries, completely different cultures,” she says. As a student activist in South Africa, her father campaigned against apartheid. “He was part of the ANC,” she says, “fighting for their rights.” At risk of being sent to Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for almost two decades, he left South Africa, helped to resettle by the UN’s Refugee Agency UNHCR. Belle is another case in point. Dido Belle, raised by the Earl of Mansfield in Kenwood House, north London, goes on to further the progress of abolitionists (on screen in any case there was some dramatic licence). Mbatha-Raw had chased the role because she was excited to get the chance to play a black woman in a period costume drama who wasn’t a servant. “I think it’s really, really important to bring to light these untold stories,” she says. “They deserve to have an audience.”Although fictional, Mbatha-Raw’s character in her new film, the Edward Norton-directed, 1950s-set Motherless Brooklyn, had a similar pull. She plays Laura Rose, a lawyer and community activist campaigning against racial discrimination. Norton’s detective Lionel Essrog begins following her, and as a bond begins to grow, she guides him through a corrupt political landscape. It is a tender relationship but Laura Rose, battling the city’s big business behemoths, is more than the love interest or spider-woman often found in such genre work.“With movies from the 50s,” says Mbatha-Raw, “we’re so used to seeing the archetypal housewife. Even in the noir genre you’re the femme fatale or the jazz singer. I love the fact that even though Laura grew up in the Harlem jazz scene, she has a law degree. She traverses the worlds: the jazz club, and her activism. She has all of these layers that you don’t often get to see in cinema with female characters from that period, and certainly women of colour.”Mbatha-Raw liked the script because such stories, she says, are rarely seen on screen. Her research into the politics of 1950s New York was an education: “Learning about things like how the bridges were built low so that the buses couldn’t get to the beaches. The people who were on the buses were the poor people, poor people of colour. A very insidious, technical method to keep these people out of enjoying the city. Laura Rose has a progressive resistance to the bullies at the top.”Researching the role, she went to Harlem, while there meeting up with Denise Burse, who played the older version of her character Kelly in San Junipero. Mbatha-Raw beams when she recollects on the day they spent together, her eyes on the verge of popping out. “Oh my God!” she says, remembering. “I’d never been to Harlem before and Denise was the one person that I knew who lived there, who had always said: ‘I’ll take you on a tour.’ So I met the older me!” They went for coffee before spending the day in Harlem, with Burse pointing out old jazz bars as they traipsed about. Black Mirror fans catching a glimpse of the pair would have lost their minds.The initial draw for taking on Motherless Brooklyn was to work with Norton she is a longtime fan of his work, but she speaks intently about her character’s significance. “It’s progressive to be an activist,” she says. For some time, Mbatha-Raw seemed to lie low, not giving too much away, but she is increasingly speaking up about social issues. On her Instagram and Twitter accounts, promo-centric posts sit beside more politicised ones. I ask her about a Time’s Up retweet, presuming a show of support in fact, she has been involved since the activist organisation’s inception.“I went to the first meeting in LA about it before the 2018 Golden Globes,” she says. “I’ve been to several meetings and been part of both the British and the American gestation of the movement. Gathering together and strategising.”Her concerns are increasingly bleeding into her work, including The Morning Show, Apple TV+’s #MeToo-tinged look at US breakfast television, which was rewritten in the wake of the allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour and harassment against chatshow anchors Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, confronting such issues head-on. And after Misbehaviour, she stars in Seacole, as Mary Seacole, the British-Jamaican nurse who came to the aid of dying soldiers in the Crimean war.“It’s an actor’s responsibility,” she says, to work on things that “help the culture to evolve, and provoke conversations.” Obviously, there are many actors who couldn’t care less about such stuff. That’s a personal choice, she says: “It’s about keeping your soul nourished. About being able to hold your head up and have a conversation about your work. I don’t want to be a product.”You can certainly tell in junket interviews when stars are not quite on board with the contractually obliged claims tumbling out of their mouths. She shudders at the thought. “I’d rather feel free to express myself than feel like I was doing something for the money,” she says, “than feel like I’d sold out and my soul had withered in the process.” She giggles at the melodrama of it all. Self-effacing to the last.Motherless Brooklyn is in cinemas from Friday 6 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a2571e2b65911c6747b737a2d24836fb87acc92/0_209_5037_3021/master/5037.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0745fff7d18e0680d1c965f0ac1adc50","title":"chick fil a conservative ted cruz mike huckabee","story":"Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee condemn restaurant chain that also donated to civil rights group Southern Poverty Law CenterLeading US conservatives have turned on the fast-food restaurant chain Chick-fil-A after the company decided to cut its ties to two Christian groups that have long opposed same-sex marriage.To compound rightwingers’ fury, it has also emerged via tax filings that Chick-fil-A donated to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a civil rights advocacy organization, in 2017. The SPLC has a lengthy record of supporting LGBTQ+ and abortion rights.Chick-fil-A, previously best known for its chicken sandwiches, was embraced by conservatives due to its foundation’s funding of the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which oppose same-sex marriage.This adoration has now turned sour, however.The restaurant has “badly lost its way”, tweeted the Republican senator Ted Cruz, a prominent religious conservative. “Millions of Christians have been proud of ChickFilA’s courageous stands for religious liberty. To fund those who hate your customers is just sad.”The former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, another devout Republican, accused Chick-fil-A of having “surrendered to anti- Christian hate groups”.Having been boycotted by protesters who accused it of discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community, Chick-fil-A now faces the prospect of being shunned by some of its most enthusiastic former backers.“It’s time for Christians to find a fast-food alternative to Chick-fil-A,” said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council organization. “Not only has Chick-fil-A abandoned donations to Christian groups including the Salvation Army, it has donated to one of the most extreme anti-Christian groups in America.”A spokeswoman for Chick-fil-A said the company had fulfilled its obligations to the two Christian organizations and would now focus its donations to “education, homelessness and hunger”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fd3517dcb4ded1a886cf78e43fe764be38bdc69/0_170_5585_3351/master/5585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19fd42a7d379db59af9f71f9b3a72a17","title":"salad soup pasta yotam ottolenghi parmesan recipes","story":"Three different ways of bringing out the savoury charms of Italy’s favourite cheese: in a pasta classic with an off-grid, Middle Eastern twist, a punchy sprout salad and a cheery vegetable brothThe making of parmesan is a strict affair, from the cows and their fodder to the whey starter and rennet, to the size of the wheel and the length of the ageing. The members of the Parmigiano Reggiano consortium, which unites all producers, believe this all adds up to making their cheese the most popular in the world. They’re probably right, too. Fortunately, when it’s time to eat, things are much more open-ended. The block of parmesan you have in your fridge can make an appearance in a host of dishes you may not have thought of (and never, ever throw away the rind, either).Leftover parmesan rinds work wonders at flavouring this broth, so if you have any in the fridge, use them here instead of actual cheese. The dumplings are a little finicky, but they’re special and worth the effort. Make sure the soup is simmering before turning the heat to low, and lower in your dumplings gently. Have the lid ready, so you can cover the pan immediately and let them cook gently in the broth.For the broth1 large celeriac (750g), peeled and cut into 2½cm cubes (500g net weight)½ head swede (350g), peeled and cut into 2½cm cubes (300g net weight)60ml olive oilSalt and black pepper1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped50g pitted Nocellara olives (or other green olives), roughly chopped50g piece parmesan (or parmesan rind – see recipe intro), cut into three chunks1 tbsp lemon juice20g parsley, stalks reserved, leaves finely chopped 20g basil, stalks reserved, leaves finely choppedFor the dumplings160g parmesan, finely grated 2 tsp cornflour 2 large eggsFor the charred lemon salsa½ lemon, cut into 4 x ½cm-thick slices and deseeded40g pitted Nocellara olives (or other green olives), finely chopped2 small garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped75ml olive oilHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. For the broth, put the celeriac and swede in a large oven tray with two tablespoons of oil, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper, and toss to coat. Roast for 25 minutes, stirring once halfway, until soft and nicely browned, then set aside.Meanwhile, put a large saucepan for which you have a lid on a medium-high heat. Add the remaining two tablespoons of oil, the onion and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, and fry gently, stirring every now and then, for seven minutes, until soft and golden. Add the garlic and olives, fry for two minutes more, until fragrant and soft, then add the parmesan and fry for 30 seconds. Add the lemon juice, herb stalks, 1.8 litres water and a teaspoon and a quarter of salt, bring up to a simmer, then turn down the heat to medium and leave to cook for 20 minutes. Strain the broth, return it to the pan and discard the solids.For the dumplings, mix the parmesan, cornflour and egg with a good grind of pepper and refrigerate for 10 minutes. With lightly oiled hands, shape into 12 balls weighing roughly 20g each, squeeze tightly so they’re compact, then refrigerate again for another 20 minutes.For the salsa, put a small, nonstick frying pan on a high heat and, once hot, dry-fry the lemon slices for two minutes on each side, until nicely charred. Finely chop, put in a small bowl with the olives, garlic, oil, herb leaves, an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and stir to combine.Put the roast vegetables in the strained broth and bring it to a simmer on a medium-high heat. Turn the heat to low, then carefully lower in the dumplings, cover the pan and leave to cook gently for three to four minutes, until the dumplings are hot all the way through.Divide the soup and dumplings between four bowls, top each with a tablespoonful of salsa and serve with the rest of the salsa alongside.I know I’ve messed with an Italian classic here, but the za’atar does get along very well with the pepper and cheese. The technique for getting cacio e pepe right isn’t complicated, but it’s essential that you follow it to a T to ensure a smooth, rich sauce. It’s also essential to use a wide pan and little water to cook the pasta in, because that ensures there’s enough starch to emulsify the sauce. Grate the cheeses as finely as possible (if you have one, a Microplane grater is ideal here), so they melt happily into the sauce.Salt400g dried bucatini (or other long pasta – adjust the cooking time, if necessary)50g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature10g za’atar, plus 1½ tsp extra to serve 2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper130g parmesan, very finely grated30g pecorino romano, very finely grated 2½ tbsp olive oil 2 tsp picked marjoram leaves (optional)In a wide pan on a medium-high heat, bring 1.3 litres of water to a boil, then season with three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Add the bucatini and cook for nine minutes, until al dente, stirring every now and then so the pasta doesn’t stick together or to the bottom of the pan, and to ensure it remains fully submerged. Drain the pasta, and reserve all the cooking water – you should have about 520ml left if not, top up with a little hot water.In a large, high-sided, nonstick saute pan on a high heat, melt the butter until bubbling, then add the za’atar and pepper, and cook, stirring, for a minute, until fragrant. Add the reserved cooking water, bring to a rapid boil and cook for five minutes, until it reduces a little and turns silky. Stir the pasta vigorously into the sauce, then add the parmesan in two batches, continuing to stir vigorously as you go, and waiting until the first half has melted in before adding the next. Once all the parmesan has melted, add the pecorino, continuing to stir until it has also melted and the sauce is smooth and silky. Transfer to a lipped platter, finish with the oil, marjoram (if using), the remaining za’atar and a small pinch of salt, and serve at once.The combination of raw and roast sprouts gives this salad both depth and freshness.

Put the lemon juice, garlic, mustard, anchovies, grated parmesan, remaining 90ml oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz smooth.Put the kale and shaved raw sprouts in a large bowl with the dressing, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and toss, massaging the leaves a little as you do so. Leave to soften and wilt slightly for about 10 minutes, then add the onion, basil, hazelnuts, parmesan shards and roast sprouts, and toss together.Pile on to a large platter and serve at room temperature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d98b7039db341a3e235c6e6ea8bf6ef878cc1f/0_66_3175_1905/master/3175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e26eee40f26a567e428b668fb0c7cd95","title":"euro 2020 draw england croatia wales italy","story":"Gareth Southgate has warned against complacency after England were handed a favourable draw for next summer’s Euro 2020 finals that means they face a rematch of the 2018 World Cup semi-final against Croatia.Wales face a tricky task to progress after being paired with Turkey, Italy and Switzerland.England, already assured of playing all their Group D games at Wembley because of the unique nature of the 60th anniversary of the tournament in which 12 cities across Europe play host, will take on Czech Republic and the winners of play-off C – one out of Scotland, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Norway.None of those should particularly worry Southgate, who admitted he was relieved not to have been drawn in the group of death that contains Germany, the world champions, France, and the holders, Portugal.England beat Croatia 2-1 at home during the Nations League last year to gain a modicum of revenge for their defeat by the same scoreline in Moscow four months earlier. Southgate’s side put five past the Czechs during qualifying on the way to topping their group, although they did suffer their first qualifying defeat for almost a decade against Jaroslav Silhavy’s side in Prague in November.Southgate was wary of underestimating their opponents, particularly with the identity of the fourth side not to be determined until the play-offs in late March. “The two teams that we know, we have had really good results against them and poor results. So it’s not a group we can be complacent about,” he said. “I think everyone will be looking at Group F and be pleased they’re not in it. But Croatia at Wembley is a brilliant opening game for the fans and the players.”England will face Croatia in their first game on 14 June, with the playoff winners up next on 19 June and the Czechs in their final group match on 23 June. Croatia went on to lose to France in the World Cup final and finished ahead of Wales in qualifying. But their manager, Zlatko Dalic, insisted England will start as favourites against his side.“We are a new team compared to the World Cup,” he said. “We won there but now it will be a much more difficult – they are a very strong team with a lot of young players, it will be a big chance for them to beat us in front of their people. I’m a little bit afraid about this game.”Southgate took those comments with a pinch of salt, although he admitted that even beating Croatia at a major tournament would not exorcise the disappointment of two years ago. “I’m sure he’s being tactically economical with the truth there,” he said.While England will be hoping home advantage will mean they end up topping the group to set up a last-16 tie in Dublin, that is likely to be against one out of Germany, France and Portugal. Southgate was reluctant to look that far ahead but admitted that, with the semi-finals and final also at Wembley, this represents a great chance for his team to make history.“Everyone else can work through that like they had to in Russia,” he said. “It was a bit like: do we want to be top seeds for this draw? In the end you want to try and win every game you play and at least have control of your destiny. Then fortune will take you wherever it takes you.“At a tournament you have to have a strategy to get out of the group – that’s three games not one – and then you go from there. We want to make Wembley somewhere that teams fear coming and we do that by the level of our performance.”In a complicated draw procedure in which 36 countries were represented at the Romexpo in a rain-sodden Bucharest, Wales were placed in Group A and face a 3,000-mile trip to play their opening match against Switzerland in Baku on 13 June before meeting Turkey in the Azerbaijani capital four days later.Ryan Giggs’s side then travel to Rome to face Italy in their final group stage match on 21 June. The former Manchester United midfielder admitted Roberto Mancini’s side will start as favourites.“I think they are and that’s not disrespectful to Turkey and Switzerland because they are both good teams,” he said. “But because of their history and their performances in qualifying – 10 wins out of 10 and scoring lots of goals – Italy will be looking to win the group.”Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland also have hopes of making it to the finals via the play-offs and will be placed into Group E with Spain, Sweden and Poland if they are successful.Uefa has said it does not expect any more incidents of racism to mar the tournament despite a number of issues during qualifying. Bulgaria were forced to play their match against Czech Republic earlier this month behind closed doors and fined 75,000 euros after England players were racially abused by a section of home supporters during the 6-0 win in Sofia in October, while there were also accusations of racism during Sweden’s recent match against Romania in Bucharest.“In our experience the Euro has always been a very festive event, at least within the stadiums,” said its vice-president, Giorgio Marchetti. “We are confident that this particular atmosphere will take priority over stupid and sometimes criminal things that unfortunately from time to time happen in football and we never want to see in our sport.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23ce64d63ed36dd469fc1807ac39d8da442651fa/0_192_3941_2364/master/3941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=699c3176ea6b92d66bb989928fa63c44","title":"liverpool brighton hove albion premier league match report","story":"Was this the day Liverpool seized control of the title race? No, that happened when Manchester City were deservedly defeated here last time out. All that can be said for sure after Brighton were beaten at a surprisingly fraught Anfield is this was the day the Premier League champions disappeared from Jürgen Klopp’s rear-view mirror.A strange affair it was too. Liverpool were in control and comfortable after Virgil van Dijk put two headers past the Brighton goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan, in quick succession.Then, with 14 minutes remaining, Alisson was dismissed for handling outside his area and Lewis Dunk converted the resulting free-kick. Cue unexpected tension. Adrián, Liverpool’s replacement keeper, saved at full stretch from Aaron Mooy and almost fumbled a tame header by Pascal Gross over his goal line.But the 10 men held out to extend their lead to a remarkable 11 points by the end of November. Klopp blew a sigh of relief on the final whistle, although it could have been disbelief at 13 wins from 14 league games and a margin for error in the Premier League that suggests Liverpool’s 30-year wait for the title might end at a canter.“None of the 13 games we won was easy,” said Klopp. “We didn’t feel it for a second. It is not as though we feel ourselves as favourites in some games. We fight with all we have for the result. Result-wise it is an incredible period but we don’t think about the last 14 games. We have to think about the next one, which is Everton and a big one.“It became more complicated today with the red card and the change we had to make. We brought on a frozen goalkeeper. Imagine you go on there with shorts, a really thin shirt and gloves that are not made for keeping you warm. Some people let the free-kick happen like that and we looked a bit silly in that moment but Adrián helped us a lot. I am really proud of the desire the boys showed. The red card made it a really special win.”City’s draw at Newcastle and the prospect of edging ever closer to that league title were forgotten at kick-off when the game opened with a powerful reminder of what matters most. The entire crowd, Brighton supporters included, rose to their feet as “Justice for the 96” echoed around Anfield for the first six minutes of the game. The Kop was bedecked in Hillsborough banners in response to the latest kick in the teeth for the victims’ families, Thursday’s verdict that David Duckenfield was not guilty of the gross negligence manslaughter of those unlawfully killed at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final. “Justice delayed is justice denied,” read one.Admirably, and as always, Liverpool’s players stayed focused on the task. Klopp has identified his team’s refusal to be distracted by title talk or unbeaten runs or hectic schedules as important as their outstanding talent. It was evident once more as they parked the emotion in the stands and brushed aside the absence of the injured Fabinho to establish a commanding lead. It was founded on two precise assists from Trent Alexander-Arnold and two immaculate Van Dijk headers.The Brighton section protested vociferously when Gross was adjudged to have fouled Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Their team’s failure to track the not insignificant figure of Van Dijk at the resulting free-kick warranted more complaint. Alexander-Arnold floated his delivery deep into the area, where Liverpool’s towering central defender rose unmarked to send a looping header over Ryan.The visiting keeper was beaten again when his defenders switched off at a Liverpool corner. Alexander-Arnold was the provider once more, this time driving the ball to the near post, where Van Dijk escaped Dunk and steered a powerful header beyond the rooted Ryan. It was Alexander-Arnold’s 18th assist since the start of last season, more than any other Premier League defender. It was Van Dijk’s eighth league goal since the start of last season, more than any other player, and also Liverpool’s 41st set-piece goal in that time, more than any other team in England’s top flight. To think some people argue it is just luck.Liverpool eased off after the second goal, appearing content to conserve energy, and the nerves would have crept in earlier had Dunk converted one of two fine chances. The Brighton captain denied Van Dijk a hat-trick, in fairness, with a well-timed challenge as the defender shaped to convert and erted an Oxlade-Chamberlain shot wide.The hosts were untroubled but one long ball over the top almost changed everything. Leandro Trossard beat Dejan Lovren in a foot race and, as the substitute attempted to lob the advancing Alisson, the Liverpool keeper handled yards outside his area. The referee, Martin Atkinson, had no option but to show the Brazilian a straight red card, meaning he will be suspended for Wednesday’s Merseyside derby, but despite a stirring finale from Brighton there would be no further punishment for Liverpool. The leaders are cruising clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ead0a317221197174746b6c8ebddeb1e85dfc4/91_129_2089_1253/master/2089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31689df2b3970ed1acfa6e3a8f2c83c7","title":"newcastle united manchester city premier league match report","story":"An unbroken cobalt-blue sky signalled a perfect, gloriously crisp winter’s day but, for Pep Guardiola, rain clouds might as well have lurked at every turn. As a jubilant, critic-confounding, former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey celebrated his late equaliser for Newcastle United in front of the Manchester City manager’s technical area, Guardiola’s hopes of retaining the Premier League title seemed as weak as the low, late November sun.England’s biggest domestic honour already seems the Anfield club’s to lose and even before Jürgen Klopp’s side opened up an 11-point lead at the top of the table the City manager was hardly in the best of humours.“It’s not a good idea to think about how many points we need we have to win games,” said Guardiola as Shelvey joked that he was probably more popular on Merseyside than he had ever been as a Liverpool player. “I might be a hero there now,” said the midfielder, leaving City’s manager to lament bad luck and “very deep” Newcastle defending.Yet, although Guardiola maintained “our performance was good”, his players lacked the sheer, opponent flattening intensity of last season while their hosts’ exhilarating attacking pace diminished the value of considerable visiting ball monopoly. Several inidual performances were poor with Riyad Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus blunt in attack and Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy, the latter in particular, struggling at full-back.It was the first time Guardiola and Steve Bruce had locked managerial horns but, if Rafael Benítez’s successor could not quite reprise the victory Newcastle enjoyed against City here last season, they showed commendable spirit in twice answering back after first Raheem Sterling and then Kevin De Bruyne had put the visitors ahead.Low, very low, on possession, Bruce’s team initially sat back and watched De Bruyne control midfield during a first half in which City’s dominance was occasionally disrupted by rapid bursts of acceleration from Newcastle’s £77m attacking trident of Miguel Almíron, Joelinton and, especially, the ever entertaining Allan Saint-Maximin.Such cameos apart, there was a sense of inevitability when David Silva and Sterling combined to score with the Spaniard’s back-heeled flick finding Sterling unmarked and set to lash the ball beyond Martin Dubravka.So far, so apparently straightforward for Guardiola’s players but their apparent vulnerability to the pace of Saint-Maximin and Almíron offered Bruce a degree of hope. While Walker looked distinctly uneasy whenever the former Nice winger accelerated down the home left and Jetro Willems overlapped, Almíron persistently fazed Mendy.Newcastle’s manager had resisted a growing clamour to rest the Paraguay playmaker and such faith was vindicated when his exchange of passes with Willems created an equaliser for the Netherlands left wing-back. Generous space had opened up in front of Willems and, after taking a steadying touch, he evaded Ederson’s reach with a powerfully swerving shot, delivered with his supposedly weaker right foot. Remarkably it was Almíron’s first assist since joining Newcastle for £21m from MLS Atlanta in January.He is still waiting for a debut goal and his penalty-area confidence has drained accordingly but, damning as those bald statistics seem, they neglect to tell the whole story. There have been several games in which the unselfish Almíron has effectively switched the lights on for Newcastle and his habit of alternating flanks with Saint-Maximin as they sporadically swept Bruce’s side high up the pitch ensured City could never properly relax.With tight marking restricting De Bruyne’s room for manoeuvre City briefly looked out of ideas but, after Shelvey wasted a free-kick in a menacing position, they finally galvanised themselves, began sucking Newcastle markers out of position and tested their hosts’ collective powers of concentration. The time had come for Dubravka to shine in the home goal and he did not disappoint. Most notably, the Slovakian made a stunning double save from first Jesus and then De Bruyne.There was barely a hint of a breeze but suddenly Bruce’s players were in the eye of an attacking storm. Despite the best efforts of Federico Fernández and Paul Dummett, their defensive lines were finally breached when the resurgent De Bruyne intercepted a defensive header, chesting it down imperiously before restoring the visitors’ lead with an unstoppable volley which flew in off the underside of the bar.Guardiola’s look of quiet contentment was not destined to endure, though. When Fernandinho felled Javier Manquillo on the edge of the area Christian Atsu pulled the free-kick back for Shelvey to send a superlative 25-yard shot curving inexorably into the top corner.“I’ve been pleased with Jonjo in the last few weeks,” said Bruce. “Was his or De Bruyne’s the better goal? I’ll let you decide.” No prize for guessing what Klopp’s answer would be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7fc3174bbabbe2e94993bdfb2a2c9a01afc488b/0_35_3282_1970/master/3282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d19a1af6b6592837010bd10983136b1d","title":"raul sanllehi unai emery arsenal  manager recruitment","story":"When Ivan Gazidis sat down alongside Unai Emery at the latter’s unveiling in May 2018 he openly acknowledged he was not presenting the man who, until the very last moment of the recruitment process, everyone else had been expecting. It had all been pretty surprising to Mikel Arteta, too, given the former Arsenal midfielder had been in advanced talks about taking the head coach role. In a rhetorical flourish typical of the now-departed chief executive, Gazidis suggested anyone following the story until this point had been several steps behind all along, saying: “Those who know won’t speak and those who speak won’t know.”It was all a little self-congratulatory and now feels fruitless, too, because Emery’s subsequent demise means there will be an even steelier gaze on the selection of his successor. Gazidis works for Milan these days and another of the three-man panel that recommended Emery to the club’s owners, the head of recruitment, Sven Mislintat, controversially moved on in February.So the common denominator in the two exercises will be Raul Sanllehi, who became head of football when Gazidis departed last December, and there is a sense the former Barcelona administrator will stand or fall by the decision he oversees next.The way Emery, who never looked a comfortable fit at Arsenal and struggled to communicate with his players, fell short casts a sharp light on the machinations that brought him there. Gazidis had spoken of the “chemistry between us” in Emery’s interview but had also been quick to ide responsibility for the choice, stressing it was unanimous. The noises since then suggest it was in fact Sanllehi, who held the more lowly head of football relations title at that point, who got his man in the end. For every painstaking analysis of Emery’s failings there must be an acknowledgement that the biggest error in the first place was to decide he ticked more boxes than seven other interviewees.Sanllehi will sit on a new committee this time, joined by his choice for the technical director role, Edu, and the managing director, Vinai Venkatesham. The merry-go-round that took place in the executive positions while Emery was in charge offers some mitigation for the on-pitch performance.The house needs to be in order upstairs and how effectively the panel works to choose the most suitable manager now will be a sound indicator of Arsenal’s health.It is why alarm bells sounded when Nuno Espírito Santo, the Wolves manager, was mentioned in connection with the role in the 48 hours before Emery was sacked. Nuno’s performance at Molineux, albeit with the resources of Fosun and the network of Jorge Mendes, has been exceptional but the catch lay in the small print. Sanllehi knows Mendes well and an element of distaste surfaced among some sections of the fanbase at the prospect of Arsenal handing de facto control to the so-called super-agent.In fact Nuno is not being seriously considered for the role but it would be no surprise if his name had been used to test the water for what might be deemed acceptable. It would be unfair to suggest Sanllehi is hellbent upon thrusting the club into Mendes’s clutches the salient point is nobody really knows what shape he or the Kroenkes, who will ultimately nod through whoever is proposed to succeed Emery, want Arsenal to take.The jury is out on Sanllehi among some who work closely with Arsenal on player-related issues. The 15 years he spent at Barcelona, working as director of football and riding out the different intrigues that arise in that boardroom, marked him out as a skilled negotiator. But he is perceived as a contracts and contacts man someone fluent in legalese and a master broker of deals in South America but hardly a club-builder or player-spotter.That would seem less important had he not given the ambitious Mislintat, whom he and Venkatesham passed over for the technical director role, little choice but to depart. Mislintat, a magnetic character with encyclopaedic knowledge and a compelling talker about the sport, was hugely popular with those who regularly crossed his path and informed observers ask how on earth anyone with his gifts could be perceived as a square peg in a round hole.The perception is that Arsenal’s power-brokers are short on genuine football expertise and, in some ways, the current setup feels like a regression to the days before Gazidis began ripping up Arsène Wenger’s old power structure. That theory may be proved wrong if Edu, described as “the final and very important part” of the club’s jigsaw by Sanllehi, can bring his own instincts to the fore. If Sanllehi appears the dominant figure in the recruitment triumvirate, there is an argument Edu is at least as crucial: should his keen sense of the club’s history be matched by a convincing, football-literate vision of how Arsenal should proceed, perhaps he can temper any reflexive recourse to the contacts book from elsewhere.“We had some clear criteria,” Gazidis said on that day 18 months ago. “Aggressive, entertaining football personality that fitted with Arsenal’s values also a record of developing players through detailed tactical instruction and also cultural demand, pushing players.” Even today it sounds like a perfect balance now Arsenal must hope Sanllehi and his reshuffled band of power-brokers can make it second time lucky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/243ad2a7fd95950313f448c5a2171a88dde68581/0_219_4851_2911/master/4851.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=966541164b7c556e24cadfcd06cb08d5","title":"tottenham hotspur bournemouth premier league match report","story":"Dele Alli continued to enjoy his personal new-manager bounce as he scored twice to give José Mourinho a third win in 10 days since taking over at Tottenham.The hosts were well worth their win thanks to some electric counter-attacking with Alli scoring in each half. Their third goal, a rare strike from Moussa Sissoko, was the pick of the bunch. But Harry Wilson’s late brace made things a lot closer than they should have been.Mourinho had joked upon his arrival that he must have been watching Alli’s brother play of late, so low had the England man’s form dipped. There was no doubting which sibling was on display in this match, however, as the 23-year-old looked every inch the man who received his second consecutive PFA Young Player of the Year award two years ago.It was odd that this victory, following previous frenetic successes against West Ham and Olympiakos, should feel so familiar. Neither was it reminiscent of Mourinho, but of Spurs under their previous boss. It was Mauricio Pochettino who created the Alli-Kane dynamic, only to leave it behind in his later seasons. The same can be said of Toby Alderweireld’s quarterback passing, which was in fashion, then out, and here against Bournemouth helped set up the first two goals.The opener came in the 21st minute and it began with the Belgian defender pinging a pass from his own half to the penalty area. The tactic, once so familiar, caught the visitors out completely and then what looked like a heavy touch from Son Heung-min became a cool pass to Alli who slotted the ball under Aaron Ramsdale to score.Mourinho celebrated by fist-bumping Callum Hynes, the ballboy who set off the move to Tottenham’s third goal against Olympiakos in midweek and who had eaten lunch with the team before this match.Alli scored his second five minutes after the restart and it was an even simpler affair, taking another 60-yard Alderweireld assist on his chest and bursting between Steve Cook and Jack Stacey to finish under Ramsdale.Eddie Howe bemoaned his team’s failure to deal with such a tactic and insisted they had prepared for it. “It was something we’d discussed and worked on”, he said “But sometimes it doesn’t look like it.”The pick of the goals was Spurs’ third, a cracking volley from Sissoko at the far post after another sparkling counter involving Alli and Son. Not only a beauty but a collector’s item, it was the Frenchman’s third goal for the club in three-and-a-half years.Then came the Bournemouth comeback, enabled by Tottenham lethargy, and a series of tactical reorgnisations on Mourinho’s part, as much as it was by the visitors’ determinations.Wilson, who had been substituted at half-time in last week’s defeat at Wolves, emerged as a second-half substitute here and first curled home a trademark 25-yard free-kick into the top right corner before finishing through a crowd of players when well found by the Dutch winger Arnaut Danjuma in the last knockings of added time.It is now three defeats on the bounce for Bournemouth and their play was promising and fragile in equal measure. That is a mixture that has characterised their miraculous growth under Howe but he would rather it were not.“We fought brilliantly last week and we did it again today,” he said. “We know what we’re capable of, but need to show it on a consistent basis. It was a great effort from the lads in coming back, showing the character we needed because at 3-0 down it was difficult for us. The first two goals killed us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345ef7ee131a8404884f3648f68148020eed1c38/266_32_1781_1068/master/1781.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=758ba88657ae43516db494d05e70eab6","title":"west ham goalkeeper david martin tearful","story":"West Ham’s goalkeeper, David Martin, embraced his father Alvin after an emotional Premier League debut at the age of 33 – and revealed he could hardly eat for two days in the build-up.The former Millwall and MK Dons keeper pulled off a clean sheet on his top-flight debut as West Ham secured a surprise 1-0 victory at Stamford Bridge, with his dad, the former Hammers stalwart, watching from the stands.Martin, who replaced Roberto in goal, said he was in tears as he walked into the crowd to hug Alvin, the former England defender who spent 20 years at West Ham between 1976 and 1996.“When I saw my dad we were both in tears, so we didn’t actually say a lot. But for my dad to see that here with the club he played for for 21 years, to make my debut, keep a clean sheet and get the win for the boys more importantly, it’s just a fantastic feeling.”Manuel Pellegrini admitted he was relieved that a series of changes had paid off as his team ended an eight-match winless streak in all competitions. The Chilean’s job remains on the line but he felt the result could be a turning point.“When you don’t win you are a beast and when you do you are a genius,” said Pellegrini. “For the team, for West Ham, for me and everyone, I think they did very well. But not only because I changed the goalkeeper. I think everyone produced the intensity you needed to win the game.”Praising Martin’s debut, he said: “Of course, we know his family is linked with this club. It was not easy for him to make his first Premier League start. But I think that from the first time I spoke in the week with him I felt he was prepared. Before the game he was very quiet but he demonstrated what he needed throughout the 95 minutes.”Aaron Cresswell’s neat finish sealed West Ham’s win, prompting a frustrated Frank Lampard to challenge his Chelsea side to produce a quick reaction in defeat.“Shocked isn’t the word, I’m more disappointed,” said Lampard. “We didn’t perform the way we wanted to. But I do believe in the squad. There haven’t been many times I have said we were below par but today was one of those days. I don’t think it’s time for harsh reactions and judgments. It is time for a look at a bit of character to see our reaction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e65528186eaa3f6a6787f2bdafef1e24680e7b3a/0_2376_6200_3718/master/6200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7fb7210588e58dd087229ba494e7f0f","title":"its an uggs game the return of uggs boots this time they are for men","story":"Uggs are back, and this time they’re for men. Priya Elan charts the brand that became synonymous with slouch – and finds the clue is in the name…There was a time when the Ugg boot walked across the earth like a colossus. They were the moccasins-cum-gazelles of their time. It was the early noughties and they were worn by Kate Moss and Beyoncé, and even made Oprah’s coveted Favourite Things list. But then in a sort of slow-motion version of the time Danniella Westbrook wore Burberry-everything (bag, skirt, baby skirt, baby buggy) and killed the check with one photo-op, the sheepskin-coloured fairy-dust that Uggs were once sprinkled with became mucky.They transformed into the Cheetos-covered uniform of Hollywood bad-girls-on-the-edge, such as Paris Hilton, Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan. Heat magazine regulars including Chantelle Houghton wore them.To walk through the streets of Clapham, south London, in the mid-noughties was to walk through a sea of unrepentant Ugg-led boho-dressing. Pashminas, gypsy tops, bootcut jeans, toe rings, the sound of James Blunt’s You’re Beautiful coming out of every post-university communal flatshare window. And Ugg boots. So many Ugg boots, absolutely everywhere. A sea of muddy brown stretching as far as the eye could see, save for the occasional Ugg over-bracelet that looked like it was made in a self-care workshop on a gap year.It’s a long way from their purple patch when Uggs were exclusively worn by celebrity men “going through some bad stuff”. Who could forget the sight of a sad-looking Ben Affleck wearing them on set, Ronnie Wood stepping out in a black pair looking like an ASBO teen, or Leonardo DiCaprio wearing them with a purple velour onesie like some regional Prince tribute act? At that time, the many memes that existed (one simply stating: “Uggs for men. No”) pivoted around ideas of masculinity.Their resurgence has been surprising, because in a world of sturdy Red Wing boots or Colorado tan Caterpillars, there’s something flat about Uggs. “It’s a reaction against the structured boot that’s become a staple of a man’s winter wardrobe,” thinks GQ columnist Justin Myers, aka The Guyliner.In the years since the Ugg was at its peak, the silhouette in men’s fashion has gone from pencil thin and tight to David Byrne-wide and expansive, and so it would make sense that as your trousers and coat get bigger, so too do your shoes. “Fashion is heading slouchier,” explains Myers, “and if wearing a boot that shares DNA with a bean bag is how to achieve that, who am I to argue?”Still, the aesthetic appeal (or non-appeal) of the Ugg is something that astounds him. “I’m surprised anyone would be desperate to seek out something so wilfully ugly,” he says. “I think it’s interesting that Ugg’s sheepskin boots and slip-ons are having a bit of a men’s moment, which seems to be driven by an ‘anything goes’ style,” agrees Esquire’s style director, Jonathan Evans.In a world where the Croc and Birkenstock have gone haute, Margiela’s cloven-hooved shoes exist and the heeled flip-flop is worn by Kim Kardashian, Katie Holmes and Rihanna, perhaps the return of the Ugg isn’t so weird after all.It also helps that the shoe is firmly associated with a time, about 15 years ago, when pumpkin spiced latte was considered edgy. Nostalgia is at a premium at the moment (hiya, J-Lo at the Versace show wearing her old dress, or Marc Jacobs, Celine and Balmain referencing their own halcyonic eras).“Nostalgic fashion is so popular – especially now – because it’s more than just a piece of clothing,” says fashion writer Kristen Bousquet. “Many of these pieces may remind you of something from your childhood or a photo of your mum that you loved from the 60s.” Myers isn’t convinced that this embrace of nostalgic fashion is welcomed equally by both genders. “Men take more convincing need easing in gently,” he says. “They are reluctant to look in their mirror and see their father staring back at them.”The Ugg comeback for both sexes has been coming for a while. They drafted in Jeff Daniels and Mr Gisele, Tom Brady, in 2016 for an ad featuring The Dude strumming a guitar while Brady napped on a sofa, both wearing Uggs. It was luxe lounging for the whisky and Bon Iver crowd. A year later, in 2017, Cardi B announced that it was “officially Ugg season” on Instagram and Heron Preston, a mate of Virgil Abloh, captioned his Ugg boot-wearing Instagram with: “We not playing games no more.”Walking through a railway station one morning, I’m struck by some huge, brightly coloured posters for the latest Ugg campaign (shockingly subtitled: “Ugglife”) there’s Slick Woods breastfeeding her baby and Ama Elsesser cradling her sister, Paloma. I go online and see the other stars of their ad campaign: Luka Sabbat and his dad, Kim Gordon and daughter Coco together. They’re slick and well shot.“I think part of the resurgence has to be partnerships,” says Esquire’s Evans, “whether that’s a collaboration like the one the brand did with Bape this year, or on the marketing side with someone like Lil Wayne, who modelled that collection.”I ask him what he’d say to a potential male buyer. “If they haven’t experienced them before, I say, ‘When you put them on it’s not like anything you’ve felt before… in footwear,” he says breathlessly. I feel slightly uncomfortable with his level of evangelical spiel about the Ugg, but I also feel like, perhaps I should forgive them for being crap in the noughties. Would I ever buy a pair I wonder? “Go Ugg yourself,” I say to myself silently.

Why, a reader asked, had her £170 Dr Martens boots fallen apart after just six months? The response was huge, with readers accusing the bootmaker of sacrificing quality, offshoring production and chasing profits under the ownership of a London-based private equity company a long way from its roots in Northamptonshire.So has there really been a decline in quality? Many  readers think so. One sent us pictures of her poorly stitched boots. “I bought the limited edition Lazy Oaf X boots for £180, two out of the three boots we ordered have broken! I have previous pairs of Dr Martens which have lasted me five-plus years so I know I haven’t ‘worn them out’.”Another reader, CH, says: “I purchased cherry red shoes and within eight months the sole was coming away from the shoe. Sadly Dr M’s workmanship and quality is not as good as it once was.”QBC from London wrote to Dr Martens, alleging: “Your production standards have dropped. The previous pair had a moulded insole that could be removed from the boot and fitted perfectly right into the toe of the boot. The replacement pair has a glued-in flat-foam insole which leaves a gap between it and the inside of the boot. Not only that but the leather that comprises the tongue is 0.2mm thinner – 1.4mm compared to 1.6mm of the previous pair.”The chief operating officer, Geert Peeters, says the shoes are still all welted, the leather has not changed and production standards have not slipped. The materials suppliers have not changed for decades and there is stringent quality control, the company says. It denies that the leather is thinner, and says shoe construction remains the same as on 1 April 1960, the day the 1460 boot was named and first made.Not true, says Dr Martens. The shift to Asia was in 2004, so it’s by no means a recent development. It says the production methods used in its Asian factories are identical to those at its base in England, and that you could pick up an operator in one of its Asia factories and shift them to England, and all the processes would be exactly the same “all the way down to putting the lid on the box”.Other critics say it is not China that’s the problem, but its new owners. Dr Martens is now owned by Permira, a £30bn group headquartered in Pall Mall, London, which bought it in 2013 from the Griggs family for £300m.“The stitching came apart on my slip-on boots. Take a brand, hand it over to venture capitalists, who then slash costs and pimp image,” was the view of one reader.Critics of private equity firms say they typically make deep cuts to jobs and operating costs then sell the business off five or six years later for a quick profit. Indeed, one Labour MP said in 2007 it was a “national scandal that the casino capitalists from global private equity groups are allowed to treat British workers and some of our biggest companies as nothing more than pawns in a game of get rich quick”. Those were the words of John McDonnell, then a lowly backbench MP who no one thought might one day be a serious contender to become chancellor of the exchequer.Yet what is also apparent from the response to our story is how many readers were recommending a brand called Solovair instead. Its shoes are strikingly similar to Dr Martens, and they are all made in England. The company made Dr Martens shoes under licence for 35 years. “We’ve been around since 1881 in Northamptonshire, and in 2006 were bought out by a local person who saved the company and kept all 60 employees in their jobs. We’re still very small compared with Dr Martens, but we’re growing fast.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9043ecbef4d5f00331cd34da0dcfbe478d2e795d/979_627_4021_2413/master/4021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18d888484162a1398507bdc938f38ad3","title":"is it safe to use public wifi","story":"I’m worried as I bought something online using my mobile on an airport networkEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.While in the airport last week I went online and purchased something over my smartphone.

Its chief executive, Anthony Smith, said: “Passengers should claim compensation every time they are delayed to help offset the cost of the fares rise.”Labour said fares had risen at double the rate of wages over the decade and that public ownership would bring affordable fares for all. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “Passengers should see their fares fall in January, not another rise.”The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train operators, said it was the fifth year in the last seven that fares had come in below the mandated cap, and that passenger revenue did not cover rail running costs.Paul Plummer, chief executive of the RDG, said: “We understand that no one wants to pay more to travel.“Passengers will benefit from 1,000 extra, improved train carriages and over 1,000 extra weekly services in 2020 and the industry will continue to push for changes to fares regulations to enable a better range of affordable, mix and match fares and reduced overcrowding on some of the busiest routes.”The higher fares come into effect on 2 January, and can be checked online from Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1543de2a5263a5e32af18ff836d47c23613a74f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b78c410ae2c9af00b43d2508be21a777","title":"40 years of sheer heaven london gay superclub","story":"The venue that first brought London’s gay culture into the mainstream is still going strong today after four decades of glamour, glitz and perspirationWhen Heaven opened its doors to the disco-hungry gay hedonists of London 40 years ago this month, it was declared the hippest place in Europe. The reviewer in London’s Evening Standard was right when he guessed the huge nightclub’s appeal would soon make it popular with dancers of all sexual preferences. “Heaven’s biggest headache could be in deterring London’s non-gay discophiles who could end up trying to pass for gay to get past the elegant bouncers at the disco’s equivalent of the Pearly Gates,” he predicted.Those not born in 1979 may know the club’s fabled history as the early home of house music and have seen it featured in videos and documentaries. Or perhaps watched the opening credits of Tony Scott’s 1983 vampire film, The Hunger, as Bauhaus sings the hit Bela Lugosi’s Dead while David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve skulk around the club in sunglasses. But back then, for members of London’s burgeoning gay scene, the arrival of Heaven was the moment when a rich hidden culture became part of mainstream nightlife. It was also quickly established as a key venue for bands.“The first time I went, I saw New Order play. It was just post-Joy Division in 1981,” says Mark Ellicott, who has been running the club in Charing Cross for 11 years. “There aren’t too many venues in London that have had a more seismic influence on the club scene.” Ellicott adds that, to mark the big birthday, the club has won permission to operate as a marriage venue, with the first ceremony to take place on 15 December, almost exactly 40 years after the opening night.While Heaven’s arrival had an impact, it drew on strands of alternative disco culture already threading through the city in the 12 years since homosexuality had been decriminalised. Customers at established gay dancefloors and discreet venues, such as Bang, Napoleons, Scandals and Catacombs, had initially moved on to a club on Old Bond Street called the Embassy, opened in 1978 by Jeremy Norman. Norman aimed to provide Londoners with the kind of experience the avant garde and creative elite were already enjoying at Studio 54 in New York.By the time Margaret Thatcher had been in power for six months, Norman, who was also chairman of the posh publisher Burke’s Peerage, had made a fresh move. He took over the a vast disused roller disco under the arches near Charing Cross Station and set up Europe’s biggest club venue: Heaven.“Prior to that, gay clubs were only found underground in pub cellars,” recalls Ellicott. “Heaven was the only venue of its scale in the last few years before the arrival of the Aids epidemic. Inevitably, young people now don’t realise the importance of a single institution, but there is an appreciation among those in the know.”That institution is now to be celebrated in a reunion night, Return to Rage, at the club on Sunday 8 December. (Rage, featuring the DJs Fabio and Grooverider, was the original regular jungle and drum ’n’ bass night run from the late 1980s into the 1990s.) A documentary – made by On The Bus Productions – about the club is also due out next year, followed by another anniversary club night, Return to Heaven, being staged in early spring next year.“I was DJ-ing there in the late 80s and early 90s, and the visual effects were amazing,” says Steve Whyte. “There were often people in amazing costumes, and it all had a massive visual presence. We all felt comfortable in that environment. Until then, it would have been difficult for people to tell people you had been to a gay club.”Whyte and his business partner, Simon Needham, are behind next year’s anniversary club night, and Whyte will be interviewed by the documentary-makers, along with Heaven regular Boy George and its former owner, Richard Branson.“When it started it was still difficult for gay people to be accepted. But Heaven was a place that changed perspectives and brought the two communities, gay and straight, together,” says Whyte. “When they opened the club to other people on different nights, that broke down the barriers. It was incredible.”Social liberation did not stop tabloid newspapers producing a string of critical headlines. In 1981, The News of the World condemned the place as “more like hell”, and eight years later the Sun came down hard on drug use.The club’s first resident DJ was Ian Levine, frequently cited as the father of the Original Heaven Sound. Big names such as DJ Paul Oakenfold and club host Philip Sallon followed.Among the bands closely associated with the venue are Throbbing Gristle, who played there in 1980 and returned 29 years later for a last London show, and Nick Cave’s original band, the Birthday Party, who played the club in 1982.Branson’s Virgin Group bought Heaven from Norman that year, as the “pink pound” started to count, but Branson sold the club in 2003 to a consortium known as Pure Group. Five years later, the game of pass-the-parcel continued when Mama Group, in partnership with Jeremy Joseph, founder of the influential G-A-Y night at the Astoria, bought Heaven and moved G-A-Y to the venue. This group was bought in turn by HMV and then, when the music retailer went into administration in 2013, Joseph got it all back by acquiring the outstanding shares in G-A-Y Ltd.And so the Heaven tradition continues. Doors swing open on themed club nights each week, ranging from Popcorn on Monday to Camp Attack on Friday.In a fortnight, two men from Wales will be the venue’s first wedding couple. “If you had said in 1981, when that News Of The World piece came out, that one day we would host LGBT weddings, nobody would have believed you,” says Ellicott."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73d3ee82ff7648334c604415187a1838d794ea88/0_329_6478_3887/master/6478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56527bc9a7c05e0ef311de31e3712320","title":"coldplay live natural history museum london everyday life","story":"Natural History Museum, LondonChris Martin and co ditch unsustainable tours in favour of an intimate showcase of new album Everyday Life complete with gospel singers, global guests and the odd blue whale“Yesterday morning we were in Jordan,” marvels Chris Martin, hastily strapping on an acoustic guitar. As a statue of Charles Darwin frowns down from the top of the Natural History Museum entrance hall steps, microphone stands are rearranged around Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland. Cameramen dart about.Martin usually performs in a tearing hurry. His air of flustered bonhomie lends Coldplay’s stadium shows an air of cultural urgency they might otherwise lack. His manner is more understandable tonight. Coldplay have arrived later than the advertised 10pm. There is a lot to get through – great swaths of a new double album, special guests, a hit or three, and corny jokes about the museum.“I said, ‘When we launch our album, can we do a gig near Wales’,” Martin offers, as the skeleton of a blue whale looms above. The realisation dawns on the parents of young children here that the reason that Dippy the Diplodocus was evicted from this hall wasn’t because he wanted to go on tour, but because he was in the way. Now they have more floor space for events such as this.Tonight’s gig, in aid of the environmental charity Client Earth, has required a hectic turnaround. The band’s latest album, Everyday Life, was launched at the weekend with a performance at the citadel in Amman, Jordan, broadcast on YouTube. Two sets were separated by a seriously long drinks interval. Sunrise found the band performing half the record as the dawn broke over a city chosen for being “bang in the middle of the Middle East”, a region where relatively few western rock bands venture.Sunset, meanwhile, offered up the other half, fading light and a few dozen excitable young Ammanites on backing vocals, in lieu of an audience. Both films featured atmospheric drone-cam shots of Amman, in which women pegged out clothing on rooftops and cars snaked past in the city below: everyday life, but perhaps exotic window dressing too. Due to environmental concerns, this is as live as Everyday Life will get. Coldplay won’t be touring until tours are more sustainable.If that announcement prompted dismay internationally – with their “oh, woah-oh” choruses, Coldplay export very well – the band don’t exactly have a citadel to climb to please tonight’s hometown crowd. Most bands are far more rewarding up close – tonight is very intimate, by Coldplay standards. And gigs in museums beat those in soulless hangars, even with the band’s trademark light-up wristbands.Coldplay’s job is made easier, too, by the fact that Everyday Life is one of the more eventful and intriguing albums in their catalogue. One song, Guns, calls for gun control in the US, quite a rarity for a band who usually use non-specific emotional watercolours, even on Politik, their 2002 song about 911. Another new album track – Trouble in Town – features grim audio of US police harassment (although that clip isn’t played tonight).One track has a title given only in Arabic it features a passage in Igbo and a blessing from spiritual jazz greats John and Alice Coltrane. The start of Èkó recalls west African kora music. Coldplay even go doo-wop.All this does sound try-hard written down, a little “woke” after the fact. Not far away in west London, Damon Albarn – of Blur, Gorillaz and Africa Express – is probably rolling his eyes at Coldplay’s exciting new dalliance with world music. Somewhere in an Irish keep, Bono is tenting his fingers and chortling at how precisely Coldplay are following U2’s grand gestures yet again.But these new songs are often persuasive. Played out in this Victorian cathedral to science, this latest iteration of Coldplay – rootsy, open-bordered, a little sweary – gels.Naturally, some of the new songs, such as Church, remain resolutely true to type. Although Martin opened up about his past religiosity and his current attitudes in a recent interview – God is love, roughly – Church isn’t actually about religion. It finds Martin extolling romantic love as succour.As for God, free badges are available, with “love” written on them, and four gospel singers add their voices to Broken, an out-and-out gospel tune. It’s worth seeking out the band’s jokey album press conference video, in which Coldplay get all the barbs against themselves in first. “I was wondering if you were familiar with the old quote, ‘when the songs are dire, call the gospel choir’,” snarks Carrie Brownstein, asking questions alongside Fred Armisen.The backing vocalists come on and off again several times tonight – once, for a particularly mellifluous version of Fix You, the most enduring of their lovelorn ballads, where Martin hands the last part of the song over to their sweet tones.Like the album, the gig is busy with moving parts. A string section comes and goes. Dressed in a billowing white gown, guest vocalist Norah Shaqur adds an Arabic part to Broken and to the closing title track. These international guests and their cross-genre malleability actually suit Coldplay, the erstwhile fair trade campaigners, far more than the usual vapid cross-branding exercises they undertake.Most genuinely moving tonight is a track called Arabesque, a song that seems slightly misnamed, as it recalls the desert rock of Tinariwen more than anything north African. The gig becomes fluid and supercharged with rhythm when Femi Kuti, son of Fela, and the horn section from his Positive Force band arrive – and then remain on stage for one of their own tracks.Orphans, by contrast, tells a story set to the backdrop of the Syrian refugee crisis. The ringing chorus – “I want to know when I can go home and get drunk with my friends” – aims to drive home the point that refugees are just like the rest of us.

After a short time covering him on the campaign trail, I thought he would do a lot better then people expected. By the time of the next general election, in 2017, I, probably in a minority of one, thought he could win.Corbyn is quite relaxed with a camera around. When we first met, he would ask: “What do you want? What should I do?” But now he understands I’m not trying to do photocall pictures I want it to be as if I wasn’t there.To start with I didn’t have much special access, but over time I persistently asked to follow him. I don’t think the Labour team ever started to trust me, but they did start to tolerate me.I wasn’t expecting him to do the Eric Morecambe pose. I didn’t suggest it. A member of the public asked to do one with him and then he got Lizzi to do one, too. It was very spontaneous.Corbyn is much more relaxed and open than his minders from the press team. He said to me once, “Oh Sean, are you coming on the train with me?” and suddenly all of his people looked worried I could see them thinking, “Oh no, don’t invite him – what are you doing?”He seems very happy and rejuvenated when he’s on the road and appears to prefer it to being in Westminster: I think he feels it’s a bit of a club, an echo chamber. On the road, he seems genuinely engaged, albeit mostly with Labour party members. Perhaps he should go after a few Tories, too.He’s got more energy than I do. I was with him in Hartlepool one day, back in Islington the next: he couldn’t resist popping into a tiny local street festival where there was an Elvis impersonator. Everyone there wanted to say hello to him, even the police officers. When he’s preparing a speech, he does very brief notes to himself. It seems like he’s writing prompts. In Tolpuddle, he was making his notes in a porch behind the stage, where a musician had left a guitar.I think Corbyn is the only politician I’ve photographed who doesn’t have that lifelong ambition to be prime minister. I’ve never come across anyone like that. All the others, even if there is no possibility of it happening, have that occasional glint in their eye at the thought of “what if?”. For him, agree with him or not, it is all about the policies he deeply believes in it is not about personal ambition. I think even his enemies would agree with that.I think he’s a lot more steely and capable than people think. From the little work I’ve done with Boris Johnson, he’s more desperate to be loved than Corbyn the prime minister seems to get hurt if people don’t like him.It’s become harder to get proper time with politicians. Margaret Thatcher was a lot easier to photograph than Tony Blair or David Cameron. They want to stage-manage and control things. With these shots, I feel I got some of those rare candid moments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad138ee26c8951bb60114e85c23cd2a33f5c4312/0_144_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89e7eda10d361c26e22b7af632d49d8c","title":"a week in uk politics poll shock and rees moggs vanishing act","story":"Labour’s would-be cabinet members tipped to lose seats as shaky campaigns roll onLook no further than the huge YouGov poll, including some 100,000 interviews. Not only did it predict that Boris Johnson was on course for a comfortable 68-seat majority, but it revealed that shadow cabinet ministers Sue Hayman and Lesley Laird could lose their seats. The fact that the pair were not only MPs but in Labour’s prospective cabinet stunned the political world.This section features a public awareness campaign this week. Has anyone seen or heard from the cabinet’s scarcely believable public-school comedy sketch Jacob Rees-Mogg? Ever since he suggested Grenfell Tower victims should have ignored expert advice and left the building, he has listened to expert advice and remained hidden inside his. Still, it’s evidence of his legendary common sense that Rees-Mogg has made himself scarce during this election.When candidates have to make clear that their party won’t win to reassure voters that their flagship policy won’t happen, you know a campaign may not be on track. But that is the glorious mess that the Lib Dems have found themselves in. The party’s policy to revoke Brexit if they win – a policy that has united some Remain and Leave voters in opposition – means Layla Moran and others have been making absolutely clear that the idea of a Lib Dem government is absurd. Such faith in the project!Much laughter last week stemmed from Labour’s new policy on trees. Some found it hard to believe Labour’s pledge to plant 2bn trees by 2040, equating to 200 a minute, every hour of every day. Cue a series of terrible online puns about a root and branch review of environment policy, or unfair questions about whether Jeremy Corbyn was barking.

But this election is for a UK parliament, not an English one, and its outcome also depends on choices in the other three home nations, where arguments over Brexit are cross-cut by older cultural and constitutional fault lines.The Scottish Conservatives go into this election defending 13 seats, following their surprise surge in 2017. The party was widely expected to lose most of these, as the SNP recovered ground, and opposition to Brexit and Johnson encouraged a Scottish reversion to anti-Tory voting habits following Ruth Davidson’s departure as leader.But the most recent Scottish polling has called this assumption into question. The Conservatives are presently holding firm on their 2017 vote, giving most of their Scottish MPs a fighting chance.The Conservatives’ Scottish strength derives from their position in the nation’s dual constitutional conflict over Brexit and independence. Scottish voters define themselves as much, if not more, by their views about independence from Westminster as independence from Brussels. These two existential ides cut across each other.This has created problems for the locally dominant SNP, whose pro-independence, anti-Brexit stance causes friction both with the majority of pro-union Scots and with the fifth or so of Scots who backed independence in 2014 but also backed Brexit in 2016.These tensions between independence and Brexit have allowed the Conservatives, long pariahs in Scotland, to rebrand themselves as the party of union and Brexit. Johnson’s Brexit-focused campaign may alienate Scotland’s Remain majority, but it appeals to the four in 10 Scots who voted for Brexit.Johnson’s decision to oppose a second referendum also plays well with pro-union Scots, still a majority of Scotland’s electorate overall. Support for both the union and Brexit tends to be stronger in the seats the Conservatives are defending.The SNP is gaining support overall by pushing independence and opposing Brexit, yet by doing so it may also be helping the party most firmly opposed to both these stances hold on to crucial seats.Stuck in the middle is Labour, whose appeals for compromise find few takers in the current environment, and looks set to fall below even its calamitous low ebb in 2017. The long Scottish Labour hegemony looks far away indeed.Labour has dominated Wales for even longer than it held sway in Scotland, winning the last 26 general elections in the principality. It may pay a price for this dominance, as two decades of rule in the Welsh Assembly make Welsh Labour a prominent target for the populist resentment mobilised by Brexit.The Conservatives hope they can mobilise this resentment to secure gains in a Brexit-voting country with many marginal seats. Early polls pointed to a historic Tory surge, but Labour appears to have recovered recently as Welsh voters’ attention swings back to domestic issues such as health, where local suspicions of the Conservatives run deep.Older conflicts also cut across the Brexit ide in Wales. Nationalist sentiment in the rural, more Welsh-speaking areas is mobilised by Plaid Cymru, while the Liberal Democrats had strongholds in Wales for more than a century before being wiped out at the end of the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition. The two parties have made local “Unite to Remain” alliances to maximise their prospects this time. The Liberal Democrats hope to hold Brecon and Radnorshire, gained from the Conservatives in a byelection in August, and advance in neighbouring Montgomeryshire, Liberal for most of the 20th century.Plaid will be hoping that Unite to Remain alliances will help it hold off the Conservatives in Dwyfor Meirionnydd and boost its chances in the three-cornered fight for the Ynys Môn constituency.The tangled mix of old and new conflicts is even more complex in Northern Ireland. Deadlock between the EU and the British government over the Northern Ireland border has been a persistent stumbling block in the Brexit negotiations, while deadlock between the DUP and Sinn Féin has left Northern Ireland itself without a functioning devolved government for nearly three years.Voter frustrations over the dual impasse may boil over in this election – the one recent poll we have suggests a swing against both of the locally dominant parties. Shifting local allegiances have broader implications – the DUP is broadly pro-Brexit though opposes Johnson’s deal, while Sinn Féin’s opposition to Brexit is politically impotent as it doesn’t take its Westminster seats. If there are gains for either the SDLP or the Alliance, this would add reliably Remain-supporting MPs to the Commons.The Conservatives may do well enough in the Labour Leave heartlands to secure a majority without looking beyond the borders of England. But their advance in this territory is precarious and vulnerable to even a modest narrowing in the polls. Every Tory seat retained in Scotland, or gained in Wales, is a seat less needed from England’s Brexit heartlands, while every win for the SNP, Plaid or the SDLP is an advance for the Remain cause.The Brexit election could be decided by voters who see much more than Brexit at stake.Rob Ford is a professor of politics and editor of Sex, Lies and Politics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42e9bea55223f33503c4f86c447d22ec092a34e8/0_143_4782_2870/master/4782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cf2902e1ea361e284639fe262dddaa3","title":"vince cable calls lib dems pledge to revoke article 50 a distraction","story":"Former Lib Dem leader Vince Cable has called the party’s policy to scrap Brexit without another referendum “a distraction and not a very helpful one”.After Jo Swinson replaced Cable in July, the party adopted the policy to support revoking article 50 and cancel Brexit without a second referendum, were the party to be elected into office.During a BBC Question Time leaders’ special last week, Swinson was forced to defend her party’s position.“I don’t think you could accuse us of not being upfront about wanting to stop Brexit,” she said.However, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday, Cable said the focus should have been on a second referendum instead.He added: “I’ve always argued that actually it was wildly improbable. We were never going to get 350 MPs, so the policy had been and should be to argue for the People’s Vote, going back to the public, to the referendum with support for remain.Under the first-past-the-post voting system, tactical voting is when you vote for a party that you would not normally support in order to stop another party from winning. For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids ‘“wasting” your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.“So the revoke was a distraction and not a very helpful one.”In September, Sir Norman Lamb, a former Lib Dem health minister who is standing down as an MP, said the policy was “playing with fire”.“I don’t feel personally that there are enough people out there trying to find ways to reunite our country,” he told the Today programme.“I think that the polarisation that we are seeing is incredibly dangerous. I think we are playing with fire in many ways.”Since the start of the general election campaign, the Lib Dems have been squeezed in the polls, with Swinson’s popularity figures also declining.Last week, Cable said there was a only a “one in a million” chance that Jeremy Corbyn would become prime minister as he predicted there will be a hung parliament, a referendum and another general election.He also criticised the parties’ promises to spend “more and more and more”, describing the spending pledges as “real Father Christmas stuff”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11dce4226f88749335399778249ff2054197a6df/0_11_934_561/master/934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9381aebe95db930871cda838d53c8e7","title":"uk general election 2019 poll tracker","story":"Find out who’s ahead in the opinion polls.

But last year a Russian scientist claimed she was a con artist, sparking an international dispute over the woman who may still hold the secret to eternal lifeIf time makes fools of us all, you couldn’t blame André-François Raffray for taking it more personally than most. In 1965, Raffray, a lawyer in the southern French city of Arles, thought he had hit on the real-estate version of a sure thing. The 47-year-old had signed a contract to buy an apartment from one of his clients “en viager”: a form of property sale by which the buyer makes a monthly payment until the seller’s death, when the property becomes theirs. His client, Jeanne Calment, was 90 and sprightly for her age she liked to surprise people by leaping from her chair at the hairdresser. But still, it couldn’t be long: Raffray just had to shell out 2,500 francs a month and wait it out.He never got to live there. Raffray died in 1995, aged 77, by which time Calment was 120 and one of the most famous women in France. She hadn’t lived in the rooms she owned above the Maison Calment, the drapery shop once run by her husband in the heart of Arles, for a decade. Instead, as each birthday thrust her further into the realm of the improbable, Calment held court at La Maison du Lac, the retirement home next to the city hospital. She had no immediate family – her husband, daughter and grandson were long dead – but journalists and local notables would regularly visit for an audience. “I waited 110 years to be famous. I mean to make the most of it,” she was reported to have said. One party piece was recounting how, as a teenager, she had met Vincent van Gogh he was ugly and dishevelled, she said, and locals called him “the dingo”.The pensioner appeared blessed with the stamina of Methuselah. Still cycling at 100, she only gave up smoking at 117 her doctors concluded that she had a mental capacity equivalent to most octogenarians. Enough, at any rate, to coin the odd zinger: “I wait for death… and journalists,” she once told a reporter. Aged 121, she recorded a rap CD, Mistress of Time. But even this “Michael Jordan of ageing”, as one geriatrician put it, had only so much road to run. By 1996, she was in steep decline. Using a wheelchair, largely blind and deaf, she finally succumbed on 4 August 1997. At 122, hers was the oldest validated human life in history.Some, though, believe it’s not just time that makes fools of us all. Last year, a Russian mathematician called Nikolay Zak made an astonishing claim: that it was not Jeanne Calment who died in 1997, but her daughter, Yvonne. Sceptical about the degree to which Calment had surpassed previous record-holders (the nearest verified claim at the time was 117), Zak had dug into her biography and uncovered a host of inconsistencies. First published on Researchgate, a scientific social networking site, then picked up by bloggers and the Associated Press news agency, Zak’s paper claimed that Jeanne Calment had actually died in 1934 according to official records, this was when Yvonne had lost her life, aged 36, to pleurisy. At this point, Zak alleged, her daughter had assumed her identity – they looked similar – and she kept up the pretence for more than 60 years.When the paper went viral, the French press exploded. How dare someone slur a national treasure, the woman dubbed “la doyenne de l’humanité”? And who was this upstart Russian anyway? Zak wasn’t even a gerontologist, a specialist in ageing, but a 36-year-old mathematics graduate who worked as a glassblower at Moscow State University and hadn’t published a paper in 10 years.Zak doubled down in response. He published an expanded paper in the US-based journal Rejuvenation Research, in January this year. It compiled a dossier of 17 pieces of biographical evidence supporting the “switch” theory, including inexplicable physical differences between the young and old Jeanne (a change in eye colour from “dark” to green) and discrepancies in the verbal testimonies she gave while in the retirement home: she claimed to have met Van Gogh in her father’s shop, when Jeanne’s father had been a shipbuilder. He also claimed there had been no public celebration of Jeanne’s 100th birthday, a key reference point in old-age validations.The debate spread through the French press and international gerontological circles, becoming increasingly heated. Many dismissed Zak’s switch theory as Russian-sponsored “fake news”, as the newspaper Le Parisien put it. Certainly, it seemed to be an attack on western science. As well as Calment, Zak expressed doubts about the validation of Sarah Knauss, a Pennsylvanian insurance office manager who had died in 1999, aged 119, putting her in the silver-medal position behind Calment. Was the Russian trying to sow doubt, so that his countrymen could take the lead in the gerontology field?For the people of Arles, it was a matter of local pride. They quickly rallied behind Calment and formed a Facebook group, the Counter-Investigation into the Jeanne Calment Investigation, to dismantle Zak’s claims. Their members included Calment’s distant relatives, and others who had known her although some said she had been haughty and waspish, they didn’t want her reputation sullied. They had easy access to the city’s archives, while Zak had never been to Arles: what could he know? He shot back, on their open counter-investigation forum: perhaps the “Arlésiens” were just blinded by their allegiances. “Note that from a distance it is obvious that the Earth is not flat,” he wrote.Both camps were equally adamant. One, that the woman who died in the Maison du Lac was the longest-lived human being. The other, that she was a gifted and almost inconceivably determined con artist. Which was the real Madame Calment?An age of 122 seems to defy the limits of the possible. Even two decades later, with average lifes still rising, no one has come within touching distance of Jeanne Calment. In the supercentenarian league – 110 and above – the three-year gap between her and Knauss might as well be an aeon.In Arles’s Trinquetaille cemetery, there is little to mark out the person with the world’s longest lucky streak, apart from the small book-shaped plinth engraved “La doyenne de l’humanité” on her tomb. When I visit in the last days of August, summer has checked out early the sky is overcast, the first autumn leaves are on the ground. On the mottled, dark-grey marble of Calment’s family tomb stands a pot of fake chrysanthemums and a yellowing succulent. Curiously, Joseph Billot, Jeanne’s son-in-law and Yvonne’s husband, and her grandson Frédéric Billot are marked, but her daughter is not. Yet the cemetery , in a hut a few metres away, assures me that Yvonne is buried with her mother.In a hotel garden next to Arles’s Roman amphitheatre, I meet three members of the counter-investigation Facebook group: Colette Barbé, Cécile Pellegrini and Brigitte Jajcaj. I mention that it seems odd that Jeanne did not put her own daughter’s name on the family tomb was it Yvonne who decided not to, trying to tell us she was still alive? “Oh, so you followed her all the way to the cemetery, then?” jokes Barbé. Don’t overthink it, the women say. The grave wasn’t renovated until the 1960s, shortly after Calment’s son-in-law and grandson died (the latter in a car crash) by then, Yvonne had been dead for 30 years, and Jeanne only had the most recent deaths engraved.Soon after Zak’s paper was published, the group began to scour local archives for evidence that undermined his theory. Distant members of the Calment and Billot families opened up their photo albums and personal papers. In the spirit of open debate, Zak was also accepted on to the forum, where he kept up a running commentary on the new findings. He was collegiate on the surface, acknowledging that he and the counter-investigation had a shared goal: the truth. But over time they felt his attitude – demanding people chase after evidence on his behalf, unfailingly using it to back up his own theory – begin to rankle. “Sometimes I get the impression that he thinks he understands our way of life and history better than us,” says Barbé.But digging into the past began to pay idends. One new photograph donated by a family member showed Yvonne posing on a balcony with a parasol against a mountain backdrop. Clever sleuthing with postcards and Google Maps revealed it to be part of the Belvédère sanatorium in Leysin, Switzerland – consistent with Yvonne’s diagnosis of pleurisy, often a symptom of tuberculosis. Another document seemed to confirm the gravity of her condition: her husband, Joseph, an army colonel, was granted five years of compassionate leave in June 1928 to look after her. Unfortunately, the sanitorium closed in 1960, and its records haven’t survived.If the switch did take place, maintaining this fiction in plain sight would have required an extraordinary and queasy level of deception. Yvonne would have had to share a house with Jeanne’s widower, Fernand, her own father, until his death in 1942 Fernand would have had to pass his daughter off as his wife. Yvonne would have had to force her son Frédéric, seven when “Jeanne” died, to stop calling her “Maman”.Many others would need to have been complicit. If Zak knew either the people of Arles or Jeanne Calment, the group argued, he would realise how improbable this was. A conspiracy would have been difficult to maintain in a close-knit population of 20,000, and unlikely given Mme Calment’s reputation as a “dragon”, says Pellegrini. “If people had known about the fraud, they wouldn’t have protected her,” she says.There is some debate about what happens to rates of mortality in extreme old age. Some researchers believe they continue to rise with the Gompertz curve, until the risk of death in a given year is absolute – with an effective ceiling to human life somewhere between 119 and 129. Others believe there is no such ceiling, thanks to a phenomenon known as “mortality deceleration”: the plateauing of the death rate after 105. But there are doubts about this plateau, too, due to the frequent misreporting of supercentenarians (mostly due to clerical error, rather than fraud). With such a small dataset even a few errors can skew our understanding of human limits (the Gerontology Research Group, based in Los Angeles, estimates that there are about 1,000 living supercentenarians).The validation of Jeanne Calment’s age, though, is regarded as the “gold standard” by Jean-Marie Robine, the man who helped carry it out. I meet him at his home in the village of Pignan, just west of Montpellier. Long legs stretched out in aquamarine board shorts under his kitchen table, the researcher still has matinee-idol looks at 68. His work with Calment, carried out as a demographer for the French state organisation Inserm (L’Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale), “never had validating her age as a mandate,” he explains. “It was to validate the quality of the administrative documents that attested to her age. And from what we had at our disposal, there was nothing dubious.” He points at the unbroken chain of 30 censuses – every five years up until 1946, then every seven to eight – that chronicle Jeanne Calment’s life in Arles.Only one – the 1931 census – was puzzling. Yvonne is not listed as resident in the family’s Arles apartment, which Zak takes to mean that she was already living semi-secluded in the family’s country house, 10 miles away in the village of Paradou. He argues that she would masquerade as her mother, in order that Jeanne, the one who was really suffering from tuberculosis, could avoid the disease’s social stigma. Robine has a simpler explanation: that Yvonne was at the sanatorium at Leysin.He is scathing about the Russian theory, flatly dismissing it as “pseudo-science”. But he and his co-validator, Michel Allard, have been criticised by Zak, and by some on the counter-investigation forum, for not being more thorough in their own corroborations. They did, however, conduct a series of nearly 40 interviews with Calment at the Maison du Lac, asking for details of her life that only she would know. She made some slips, unsurprisingly for her age, often mixing up her father and husband. (Zak jumped on such mistakes in excerpts of the transcripts later published in a book.) But many other details, such as the names of maids and teachers, largely tallied with the information recorded in censuses and school registers.Robine is softly spoken, but it is hard to get a word in edgeways as he builds his argument. I mention the idea that a DNA test on Calment’s blood could settle the debate. Jeanne’s husband Fernand was her distant cousin, so Yvonne had more ancestors common to both sides of her family than her mother – something that would be visible in her DNA. Robine can barely hold back his indignation at the suggestion of DNA testing. “What are we going to do – just hand it over to the Russians? To an international committee? To do what? These people are caught up in magical thinking – that the secret of longevity is in her genes.”By August 2019, l’affaire Calment had settled into a stalemate. When I speak to Zak over Skype at his dacha on the Ukrainian border, he seems more determined than ever: “With so much opposition, I want to prove that I am right,” he says. There is a flash of intellectual pride behind his poker-face. Boyish in a blue polo shirt with tousled hair, a slight smile occasionally breaks his composure. “Some people don’t care about facts. So they just hate those who disagree with them,” he shrugs.Gerontology had originally been a hobby for Zak. He was interested in the ageing process of the naked mole-rat, an animal with an improbably long life of about 30 years. But he became caught up in the Calment case after making contact on Facebook with Valery Novoselov, head of gerontology at the Moscow Society of Naturalists (MOIP), who had longstanding suspicions about her. Novoselov’s case had been based largely on photographic analysis he encouraged Zak, who spoke some French, to delve into other aspects, such as biographical and archival evidence. Zak says he had no intention of publishing anything – until he contacted Jean-Marie Robine about the “problems” he had found. “He always had some excuse about why he couldn’t reply, which I thought was strange,” says Zak. “It was this that made me carry on.” (Robine disputes that he was evasive, saying he corresponded extensively with Zak in October 2018.)As well as the lack of academic rigour in the original paper, Young believes its disproportionately high number of reads (70,000, when the revised version only got 1,400) might have been inflated by bots, or human intervention. Zak had already admitted manipulating photographs of a young Yvonne Calment to emphasise similarities with her mother. Young alleges that such sleights of hand indicate that Zak, or people working with him, had an ulterior agenda.Still, the switch camp had arguments that couldn’t easily be dismissed. There was Calment’s odd request, when Arles’s archives asked for them, that her personal papers be burned and a 2006 account in a French industry newspaper of a dinner at which a guest intimated that Calment’s insurers had known of the identity switch, but no action had been taken because she was already too famous. In mid-September, Inserm released an official rebuttal paper, co-authored by Robine, Allard and two others. While it didn’t address every aspect of the Russian case, it was a cool riposte, summarising many of the counter-investigation’s discoveries, and calling for the formal retraction of Zak’s paper.Zak upped the ante. In an open letter sent to prominent gerontologists, longevity researchers and journalists – with Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson and the White House CCed – he called again for the testing of Calment’s DNA. “I don’t think such a study would be harmful to anybody,” he argued, “while the potential benefits for science are huge.” Many people thought Zak had gone too far. One member of the board of Rejuvenation Research, which had published his revised paper, resigned, saying it had “disgraced the field of gerontology in both Russia and internationally”.Back in Arles, the counter-investigation group were also wondering about the peculiar behaviour of their “Russian friend”. He had been helpful at first, but in the depths of long comment threads he could often be provocative, even goading. One member succeeded in getting Zak temporarily blocked from the forum on 5 March for a slanging match that culminated in the Russian calling him a “crook”. “It’s very unpredictable,” says Cécile Pellegrini. “Sometimes he has a sense of humour, other times he’s odious, and we’re forced to block him for a few days.” They speculate that more than one person might be using his account, and that Zak or the Zaks might be paid trolls. (Zak denies receiving any payment or support from others.) But if Zak is a frontman, who might he be fronting for?The straight-talking 57-year-old is speaking in the canteen at the Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology in Moscow, where he has just given a lecture on Calment. Having previously argued that Lenin died of syphilis rather than a stroke, Novoselov is used to courting controversy. In January, he declared that his goal was to get Calment struck off the supercentenarians register. Wasn’t it cavalier to do so before there was conclusive evidence? “What’s conclusive evidence if there is no material from the patient?” he counters. “If they showed us her medical records, then maybe we would be convinced.”Novoselov wrote to Young at Guinness World Records about Calment in October 2018, “asking him to look attentively at the issues we raised”. His response, says Novoselov, was “a display of aggression by Europe against everything civilised” Young, he says, characterised his work as a conspiracy directed from on high by “someone important”. But its not surprising that Novoselov’s abrasive tactics have raised eyebrows he has threatened Young, as well as Calment’s validators, with investigation by Sledkom, the Russian FBI.The evidence for a Russian disinformation campaign is thin, but Zak’s paper did have a second sponsor. The peer-reviewed version was published in Rejuvenation Research, the journal devoted to life-extension research edited by Aubrey de Grey, the controversial gerontologist and life-extension advocate who has claimed that, by 2100, the human life could reach 5,000 years. Even if Zak doesn’t believe it, the possibility that Calment did reach 122 is tantalising for De Grey. “Anyone who is the world record holder of longevity is of interest to those of us studying the biology of ageing,” he tells me.Speaking on the phone from London, where he is on a stopover between Berlin and his home in California, De Grey is evasive about whether his strategy is to force the release of Calment’s blood sample. But he does think it should be made available for science: “In the interests of saving lives, finding out more about ageing to eventually postpone ageing – then that’s actually quite important.” Would he want his own research foundation, Sens, to do the DNA testing? Not necessarily, he says, “but I would certainly know the right kind of researchers to recommend”.That analysis seems unlikely to happen any time soon. The Fondation Jean Dausset, a private genetic research centre in Paris, refuses even to confirm that it is keeping Jeanne Calment’s blood just that it has a collection of biosamples it alone can use for research under anonymised conditions. But François Schächter, the scientist who in the 1990s founded its Chronos Project, the first genetic survey of centenarians in the world, has confirmed that her blood was taken and her DNA extracted.Twenty years ago, the life-extension field promoted by mavericks like De Grey was outlaw science. Now, the landscape has changed: the technical means for “hacking” the human life have come into being, and the sector is beginning to attract serious investment. In 2013, Google invested $1.5bn in an entire ision, Calico, devoted to “solving death”. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has given millions of dollars to Sens.But Sens, according to its annual reports, has been running at heavy losses. De Grey says it has been spending the $13m he put into the foundation in 2011 on research for anti-ageing therapies that will save “several million” lives. But it must start to pay its way wouldn’t securing the DNA of the oldest woman in the world be a great publicity coup, as death-dodging tech billionaires pile into the sector? De Grey bats off this idea. “I get enough media attention as it is.”If he could study Calment’s DNA, what might he expect to learn? De Grey points out that supercentenarians’ genetic material contains a high ratio of useful information, “because they have to get more things right in order to get to the age they do”. One obvious area of interest is how Calment bypassed cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other late-life killers.Several scientists I spoke to believe that Calment’s genome should be made available for study but they don’t approve of the way Zak and De Grey have seemingly attempted to force the foundation’s hand. One consequence of promoting the switch theory, they point out, is that they have alienated family members whose own DNA might be crucial in understanding Calment’s.Earlier this month, a Russian news agency announced that a woman who was purportedly 123 had died in the Astrakhan region of southern Russia. This is almost certainly impossible – even Novoselov thinks so given her children’s ages, she would have given birth three times in her 50s. But the story underlines the need for gerontology to keep its house in order.At the time of going to press, scientists from around the world were due to discuss the impact of the Calment affair on gerontology at a special meeting in Paris. As for her mortal remains, some think the Fondation Jean Dausset might be more open to collaboration as anti-ageing science evolves – but it is unlikely to be with De Grey. Despite telling me that Jeanne Calment does not figure high on his priorities, he plans to devote another issue of Rejuvenation Research to age validation and Calment next year.In Arles, despite everything, the counter-investigation group are tickled by the idea that Jeanne Calment might have been a master fraudster. “I would really like the switch story to be true, like in the novels I love reading,” says Cécile Pellegrini. “I find that kind of thing super-exciting. If it’s actually true, she was really something!” But perhaps the doyenne has something else to teach the would-be immortals of Silicon Valley: what extra trouble would 5,000 years of existence bring, if we can’t get the record straight on a single ordinary lifetime?• Additional reporting by Marc BennettsIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b4dbee7b3d4619b6e4db2ba82dea4ebd12795f2/0_112_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f7e1d4072f713a5e22cc436c7f7dcbe","title":"northampton leicester premiership match report","story":"This, rugby’s fiercest derby, has produced some crackling encounters of high drama and intensity. This one was little more than an exhibition. Not that it was any less enjoyable if you are a Saint. They are playing the rugby of the gods just now and this latest bonus-point win, sparked by two tries from new boy Matt Proctor, takes them back to the top of the table.“Today was one of our better performances,” said Chris Boyd, the latest Kiwi coach to reveal the game’s secrets to us up here. “To get the points and play well, at home, East Midlands derby – the supporters go home happy, hopefully.”What a joy they are to watch these days, bursting with star performers up front and behind, but how Leicester spirited them on their way. The Tigers are sliding deeper and deeper into the sort of mire Northampton were wading through until quite recently.“The players are incredibly disappointed,” said Geordan Murphy, “because they were blown away.”Leicester were shambolic at times. Could this, England’s biggest club, really be on the brink of relegation? There is much to play out before that proclamation can be made, but while Leicester look to the punishment meted out to Saracens for succour, Northampton make hay in the latter’s absence from the front-runners.Less than two years ago, this had become quite the most depressing place, the evident misery off the field leaching on to it. What a difference a regime change can make. After a season of Boyd, the Saints are well on the way to becoming the darlings of English rugby, now that Saracens are not quite so much flavour of the era. While the latter work their way back from the end of the table with which the Saints had become more familiar of late, Northampton are making the most of the opportunity at the other.The rugby is fabulous to watch, the mood so clearly transformed. Their two wingers, the monster and the mite, Taqele Naiyaravoro and Tom Collins, wreak havoc in their wonderfully different ways, now joined by George Furbank at full-back, who can do no wrong.Dan Biggar dropped out on the morning (as did Courtney Lawes and Owen Franks, international veterans all). No problem, James Grayson, son of Paul, slipped into place without a misstep. New to the party is the one-cap All Black, Proctor. He loved it here outside Rory Hutchinson – who wouldn’t? – and had his two tries within the first half-hour.The first was bizarrely simple, straight from a scrum. Maybe play like this just makes defences appear hapless, but Leicester’s looked just that. Less so with the next two, which were more or less unplayable expositions of vibrant rugby.Proctor scored his second in the left corner after a sweeping move down the right, featuring those two dynamic wingers and developed by Hutchinson and Furbank. Then Hutchinson and Proctor combined in their own 22, after a stolen ball from an attacking Tigers lineout, to put the latter away before Naiyaravoro sent Api Ratuniyarawa, his only slightly less massive and athletic fellow Fijian, galloping clear for a 24-10 lead at the break.Leicester were shell-shocked. It is hardly as if they are not peopled by players of the highest rank, but they are clearly suffering just the same malaise as Northampton did in the bad old days. Saracens’ troubles are also providing them with an opportunity, theirs the rather more visceral one of survival. Twenty-two points is the size of their cushion at the bottom. At this rate it will be gone by February.They owed their best bits to the good old-fashioned lineout and drive, a series of which netted them a try for Guy Thompson in the first half. A rare break-out early in the second then coaxed Alex Moon into a yellow-card offence. Ford pulled back three points, but Northampton had the bonus point five minutes later.A horrific mix-up by Leicester at a lineout on their own five-metre line was exploited by Tom Wood. Cobus Reinach’s long pass put Collins in for a stroll to the corner. In the last 10 minutes, Fraser Dingwall scored Northampton’s third try.If Leicester want encouragement they need look no further than Northampton’s transformation which gives hope for us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ce0c4698cab5cba79872dd5790ad556c33217a8/0_149_2333_1399/master/2333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b01e3421074954b021ff23da4d67de7a","title":"new zealand v england second test day three live","story":"31st over: England 94-2 (Burns 46, Root 33)  Williamson turns to Daryl Mitchell, who does a funny quick-step at the top of his run, before steaming in with his high-knee-ed approach. Root watches carefully for five balls then flicks him for an easy four.I am pleased to say that in the next three months I will be watching an England Test match below Table Mountain at Newlands during the New Year Test, and then below Galle Fort in Sri Lanka in March, writes Neil Waterfield. I can think of two no finer grounds in the world, but will be happy to find others. You lucky thing! Beautiful grounds in amazing surroundings. 30th over: England 89-2 (Burns 46, Root 29) Burns does sticks his bum out at the crease, he must have great quads. But enough of that - pow! - that’s quite a shot, with straight arms he swats Wagner to the boundary. Next one is short again, and Burns swivels pulls again behind square for another four. England rock’in on. 29th over: England 80-2 (Burns 38, Root 28) Burns is looking good here. He’s over the nerves and hitting crisply. He dispatches Southee with a whizz-crack to the boundary with a sharp pull.Peter Salmon has his mind on David Warner.  Do you think Stuart Broad would have been looking at Warner’s innings yesterday and thinking, well, that would have taken me about four balls?28th over: England 76-2 (Burns 34, Root 28) Root eyes up a short one from Wagner, swivels and pulls him for four. Lovely. And again, though with not quite as much power and just gets the single. Then a fine on-drive from Burns which is cut off just before the rope. Next ball he’s crunched in the chest by a short one. This Wagner, he makes thing happen. And that’s the fifty partnership between Root and Burns.Chris Bull has listed his top grounds on the fantasy trip: Antigua - the recreation ground. Cape town. Dharamsala. Adelaide. Galle. Wellington.

Burns gets four leg byes past a desperate Watling. 26th over: England 64-2 (Burns 31, Root 23) Aha! New Zealand turn to Wagner to see if he can extract some zing from this pitch. He shoves one in short with every effort of his visible being, the polar opposite of Jofra Archer - whose effort is seemingly effortless - and Burns ducks and it pings off his shoulder for a single. Root ducks the nextIn answer to your question William, if I could magic myself to these places so that I didn’t have to worry about my carbon footprint: I’d go to Eden Gardens and Barbados (neither of which I’ve been to), then Sydney, where I could visit my brother, then one of the lovely small New Zealand grounds - happy to be advised - where I could meet my other brother and ....25th over: England 59-2 (Burns 29, Root 21) We get a close up of Root, eyes darting hither and thither from under his helmet. Southee bowls and Root looks uncomfortable, his feet static. Better next ball, full face of the bat. He nods. 24th over: England 57-2 (Burns 29, Root 19) Henry testing here with his line, but Burns and Root resist doing anything silly. Half an hour safely negociated. 23rd over: England 55-2 (Burns 28, Root 18) Just a couple from Southee’s over - this feels like a crucial first hour. Both these two have the ability to bat big, but are vulnerable early on.22nd over: England 54-2 (Burns 28, Root 17) Henry and Watling have an earnest chat. A few balls later, Root glovepulls him, slightly uncomfortably down for four. Thank you Johns Potter and Little for pointing out that England are batting not New Zealand...Also, and apropros of nothing, I saw Dear Evan Hansen last night (if you love a good emotional roller-coaster with cracking songs, I recommend it).

Joe Root brings the England fifty up with a confident-looking pull off Southee.20th over: England 49-2 (Burns 28, Root 12) At the other end, we have Matt Henry, and Joe Root sends him scurrying for four, a back foot push through backward point. Burns then plays a slightly less confident looking shot, which squeezes through third man for another boundary We get a wide-lens view of the ground - it’s gorgeous, green and very pleasant. Trees, grassy knolls, picnics and a few half-hearted clouds. 19th over: England 40-2 (Burns 24, Root 7) Southee bowls the first over of the day, just a single from it, a back foot push from Root. A discordant version of Jerusalem drifts across the ground.  TMS tells me the players are out, but the TV is running rather behind ... this could be interesting...We need to talk about David Warner. What a story - boy from the wrong sides of the tracks, proves the doubters wrong, falls dramatically from grace, then redemption.Interesting. Atherton is backing Root to make runs today. He’s been watching him in the nets, and “he’s been hitting the ball beautifully.” He’s tougher, Athers adds, than his angelic features might suggest.There’s a christmas tree in the Sky studio. The mood in there is moderately dark. Mark Butcher says Joe Root, “has to go out and make a big one.”Out on the ground, Ian Ward and Mike Atherton are talking to Jos Buttler. Wardy admires Jos “beasting it” in the gym.Athers asks how Joe Root is coping with the pressure,“You wouldn’t know any different,” says Buttler. “He manages himself very well. Cream always rises to the top, his batting form will come back, probably today.”Hello fellow time-zones-surfers, and welcome to day three of the second and final Test against New Zealand. They’re starting half an hour early today (9.30pm GMT, 10.30am NZST) in Hamilton, still making up for the grotty weather that truncated day one. New Zealand are whistling to the ground this morning, their bow ties perky, their trainers bouncy - two English wickets down with only 39 on the board.All is not lost for England, but two of the newbies failed to endure a nasty final session of 21 overs yesterday evening. Unfortunate Dom Sibley, never the nimblest, was cuffed on the helmet and then on the box on the way to being bowled by a leg-stump half volley.  Joe Denly prodded at a wobbler from Matt Henry and was well caught by BJ Watling behind the sticks.The two men who will walk out this morning are Rory Burns, dropped twice yesterday, and Joe Root, suddenly under reams of news-print pressure over the captaincy. “We know we’ve got to go and bat 150 overs here to set up the game on day five,” Stuart Broad said. “Our opportunity is there...Here we’re not batting with a scoreboard of 500. They made 375. So, I think our pressure is reduced slightly and we just go and play.”If you’re a batsman, you’d want to bat out there, wouldn’t you?” he added helpfully. “If you were good at batting, you’d fancy that.”Let’s see hey Stuart.In other news, poor Jack Leach is still in hospital with gastroenteritis, ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/410f38d073117b7eb66ac1e4d4e378f849647d60/0_156_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa84138d96d12f592b3cdea43b5699c9","title":"uber ride hailing alternatives london tfl kapten bolt viavan","story":"For London, Uber is not yet over. But last week’s decision by the capital’s transport authority to reject the global ride-hailing firm’s application to renew its licence has put its long-term prospects in doubt.Two years ago, Uber promised to work with Transport for London (TfL) to become a better service provider, and can list many positive steps taken. Yet TfL still had doubts about its security processes – doubts confirmed by revelations that 14,000 journeys were undertaken by drivers who had faked their ID on the app. Now, to the delight of the vocal black-cab lobby, London has once more told Uber that is not fit to hold a private hire licence.An appeals process virtually guarantees it at least another year: Uber can go on operating in the capital until every legal avenue is exhausted. And it may well be granted a licence again if it demonstrates to a judge that it has made changes. Competitors, meanwhile, are circling, eager to capture a share of the lucrative London market.For the 3.5 million Londoners who have downloaded Uber’s app and grown used to its convenience, how do the alternative apps shape up? Here the Observer test-drives Uber’s key rivals in the capital.Founded in Estonia in 2013 (and formerly known as Taxify) this company has spread across Europe and beyond. It launched in the UK this year (after a failed attempt in 2017), operating within greater London and at airports around the capital.USP It looks much the same as Uber, but claims to charge drivers less commission, offset all carbon emissions and still offer lower fares. Having signed up 30,000 drivers in London, it says the average waiting time for a cab is now 4.5 minutes. With 1.5 million app downloads, it appears to be emerging as a direct and serious rival to Uber.Quick test drive Quotes were cheaper – especially with generous introductory offers – in a smaller fixed range, and as quick to arrive as Uber. But will it remain sustainable? The driver was on his first trip after switching from Uber, looking to hedge his bets.Launched in London in May, this French firm now has about 20,000 drivers and 900,000 customers on its app.USP It claims to have the lowest prices, with fares fixed when a booking is confirmed. Kapten also has about 1,000 electric cars in its fleet, sometimes at a discount in central London, although usually with a longer wait for the nearest one available.Quick test drive Prices jumped at peak times, despite claims of “more sensitive” and transparent surge pricing – and the base fare for a trip also seemed to vary significantly. A booked “electric” car also turned out be a hybrid Prius, a fairly standard choice across Uber and the rest. And when bad traffic and bad reception forced a cancellation, conflicting messages in the app warned variously of a £5 fee and no charge.A joint venture set up by Via – which licenses its tech for car-pooling services in the US – and Mercedes-Benz Vans, it has operated an Uber-style service in central London, since April 2018, with 1.2 million customers and more than 20,000 drivers. (It’s also available in Milton Keynes.)USP The app encourages car-pooling, with the default option being a shared ride – slightly cheaper than a private cab even if no other passengers are along. It claims to have a better algorithm that means customers will not have to endure such big detours as they do on Uber’s platform.Quick test drive Several attempts at booking saw the first vehicle offered disappear, although ViaVan lets you cancel for free if the initial wait is long. Prices were not much cheaper than Uber, even with an offer to share the ride. The actual ViaVan, when it arrived, was, again, a Prius.After a brief monitoring of the apps and several trips in central London Bolt seemed to emerge as a ready and serious rival to Uber. Kapten didn’t quite live up to its promises, and ViaVan would be impressive if its stated ambition to drive smarter car-pooling took off and eased congestion, but that won’t happen until it achieves critical mass. For now Uberpool quotes look cheaper.The promiscuous traveller could grab promotional deals on these other apps now, especially Bolt, but – as with early Uber – it’s hard to see these fares being sustainable. Meanwhile, drivers’ option to work on multiple platforms gives them more leverage and choice. For passengers, like consumers switching electricity provider, the ultimate product looks pretty much the same.While TfL has approved the other apps, Uber is for now the only one that flags up public transport alternatives – which are often quicker and far cheaper – in central London. After fiddling with multiple apps and frustrating waits, the idea of a bus, a walk and more cash in your pocket is pretty appealing.Addison LeeAn extensive fleet of smart private hire vehicles made this the big challenger to black cabs, pre-Uber. App offers fixed fares and future bookings. Free NowFormerly MyTaxi (which swallowed Hailo), this is an app to call traditional black cabs rather than flag one down on the street. Taxis get to go quicker on congested roads using bus lanes, and the fare difference can be erased during rivals’ surge pricing. It is in eight other UK cities, including Edinburgh, Manchester and Brighton.GettAnother black-cab app, with the same advantages. Fares are charged by the meter, with an electric taxi option. It’s bigger in cities outside the capital.Ola This Uber-style rival from India is threatening to join the turf war. It started its UK operations in south Wales but is now licensed by TfL and recruiting for a full London launch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45db504014df1bc061f90a52b4bac13f72bf3dd9/300_114_2962_1778/master/2962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1af7302d40ec215da57112a76385855a","title":"christmas family tv viewing animation children books","story":"A cosy Christmas afternoon on the sofa in front of a children’s animation is a reliable feature of seasonal television in Britain: half an hour of fun and sentiment in an otherwise commercialised festival.But this gentle arena, once dominated by Raymond Briggs’s The Snowman, has become a hotbed of creative competition, with three high-quality films destined for the small screen this year.Leading the pack for star names is The Tiger Who Came to Tea, a Channel 4 co-production with America’s NBC. The late Judith Kerr, who wrote the much-loved children’s book, advised on the film in her final months. She approved the lyrics of a catchy song, Hey Tiger, sung by Robbie Williams, agreed to David Walliams as the narrator and helped to choose a voice cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch, David Oyelowo, Paul Whitehouse and Tamsin Greig.BBC One is to fire back with two new offerings. The first is a musical based on Michael Morpurgo’s story, Mimi and the Mountain Dragon. With a score by Oscar-winning composer Rachel Portman and based on Emily Gravett’s original illustrations, it tells the story of a shy girl who finds a baby dragon in the woodshed.The author of The Gruffalo, Julia Donaldson, meanwhile, has enjoyed success in the Christmas animation slot with versions of her hit books, illustrated by Axel Scheffler. Her regular collaborators Magic Light Pictures have now made The Snail and the Whale for BBC One. It uses the voices of award-winning actress Sally Hawkins and comic stars Rob Brydon and Cariad Lloyd to tell the story of a snail who hitches a ride on the tail of a humpback whale to see the world.Kerr, who died in May aged 95, hoped the new film of The Tiger Who Came to Tea would go on to be re-voiced in other languages and shown all over the world. Her original story, published in 1968, came to her when she was at home on a rainy day with a three-year-old to entertain. Her tale of the surprise visit a big cat pays on the home of a young girl went on to sell five million copies.The film, made over two years by Lupus Films, creators of The Snowman and the Snowdog, begins with the familiar opening sentence from the book, “Once there was a little girl called Sophie”, and has the spare style of Kerr’s illustrations, using plenty of white background space.Oyelowo has said that he jumped at the chance to voice the tiger, adding that he “relished all of the growling, chomping and slurping, which called on me to find my inner cat”.The music is designed to echo the way Sophie, played by seven-year-old newcomer Clara Ross, skips.Lupus’s founders, Ruth Fielding and Camilla Deakin, had to pitch for the rights directly to Kerr, and the author’s guidance was crucial, they said. Walliams, who knew Kerr well, said the book was a “stone-cold classic” and “a thing of beauty”. “There isn’t a word out of place, the illustrations are just gorgeous. I really wanted to be a part of it and I was chuffed that she wanted me to narrate.”Sophie’s tiger, as fans know, eats her family out of house and home, and then leaves as suddenly as it arrived. True to the book, the little girl is left hoping that he may return, and this time she is seen stowing away a large tin of tiger food in the larder, just in case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ae984f3c76af326313045444b608349930bc20e/0_156_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc50f318ec8bf161a00b31543a808cd4","title":"friends central perk london","story":"For those who grew up in the 90s and early 21st century, Central Perk was the ultimate coffee shop. It’s where we spent hour after hour picking over Ross’s serial orces, screaming with inner terror at Phoebe’s singing career and psychoanalysing Chandler’s defensive sarcasm. And on Thursday afternoon this hangout of the Friends gang, transported from New York to east London for a festival named FriendsFestive, was packed with fans celebrating 25 years since the show appeared on our screens.Charlotte Hardinge is 24. She was born after Friends began and was 11 when it ended. Her trip was a surprise Christmas present from her boyfriend Michael, who watches it too. As she sits on the cafe’s big sofa, she looks around the coffee shop she has seen so many times in her home. “I watch it every day,” she says. “My parents loved it, and I would come in from school and it would be on. So I kept watching it, series after series. It never gets old.”She is briefly interrupted by an outbreak of Phoebe’s anthem, Smelly Cat, from the stage in the corner of the shop. “Even though it’s very 90s, it’s still relatable: twentysomethings starting life.”The relatability, which comes up time and again when people discuss the show, is why the Friends juggernaut just keeps trucking. It’s the most-streamed show in Britain, and at No 2 on Netflix in the US (behind The Office). Not surprising when 10 million people in Britain – 53 million in the US – tuned in to the final episode in 2004.At FriendsFestive – which runs until 21 December – fans have the chance to re-enact their favourite scenes in Monica and Rachel’s apartment, studying costumes and memorabilia from the show, practising Ross and Monica’s dance routine and getting into a festive Friends-themed singalong outside the Holiday Armadillo’s grotto. There is a sense of electric excitement at being able to act out lives with which the show’s devotees are so familiar.The sitcom is astonishingly inter-generational. Joanne Undrell, 40, is at the event with her daughter, Charlotte, and Charlotte’s best friend, Phoebe. The girls are both 10 and have seen all 236 episodes. “Over and over again,” Undrell adds. “I like them watching it because it reinforces the meaning of friendship and fun.”Charlotte grins and nods. “You can relate to it in modern days, and not only back in those days,” she explains as a big screen behind them shows Chandler’s desperate attempt to cover up his relationship with Monica.Phoebe agrees with her friend: “It’s a good way of thinking about life – they come together as friends in a single year and stay together for 10 years. It’s good to have friends.”Friends is even making its way on to the silver screen this Christmas. From 8 December, cinema chains are screening 12 of the best-loved episodes in four-episode chunks. It’s virtually unknown for TV shows to be shown in cinemas, but the sheer torrent of support for the sitcom makes it commercially viable.Or – something of a niche in-joke for fans, perhaps – the US homeware chain Pottery Barn will be re-releasing its faux-antique “apothecary table” that was the centre of a plotline in the sixth series. Even the makers of Friends have been taken aback by the show’s continuing appeal. Co-creator Marta Kauffman said it was a “glorious surprise to me that the show has lasted and has this whole new other life”. The secret, she said, was that its subjects are fundamentally nice people: “It’s not dark, not twisted, not about corrupt people. It’s comfort food.”Above all, viewers see themselves in the characters, says Ian Youngs, arts and entertainment reporter for BBC News. “It was the biggest show of its day for a reason, and quality lasts. But even saying that, its popularity among viewers who weren’t alive first time around is remarkable. One reason it connects is that the characters are dealing with the stuff teenagers and young adults are all navigating: friendship, love, independence.“And while the characters tackle some big life events, there’s a simplicity and innocence. The outside world rarely encroaches, and the show’s an escape from some of the shadowy things people have on their minds today – including social media, which the friends never had to worry about. Above all, it’s warm, it’s cosy, it’s relatable, and it’s still very funny.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c085ac32b937284c70cb0637bf6ad99a56c7bd3/0_147_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ec0d82dacc2218229ba4c1625db6f99","title":"strictly come dancing 2019 the quarter final live","story":"It’s musicals week, and the five remaining couples tackled everything from Oliver! to Hairspray.

We’re back here tomorrow night from 7.20pm for the Results Show, so please join me back here then! Hx *CURTAIN FALLS, HOUSE LIGHTS GO UP*Goodness, the dancing’s over! That was quick. The lines are open, so get voting for your faves. Kelvin, Karim and Emma are very much centre stage this week, whilst Alex and Chris are propping up the chorus. Surely those two have to be in the dance off tomorrow? Time for a recap – my favourite performances this evening was definitely Kelvin and Oti, but it was a pretty epic show all round. Scores: 9,10,10,10 – a total of 39 for Emma and Anton. The tens have gone WILD this evening.Shirley thought Emma fast-tracked her way to the final – it was fantastic. Bruno liked that it was a genuine 1920’s Charleston, Emma was a perfect high-class flapper. Craig loved the swivel – it was classic, classy and fab-u-lous. Motsi thought Emma was the icing on the top of a fantastic evening. Good to see the Flavia wig having an outing, it’s been in its tiny cage too long. Emma has great swivel and characterisation in this dance, it could be strongly argued that she’s out-dancing Anton right now. I absolutely loathe this kind of musical number, but Emma is smashing it. Enjoyed that very much. And finally tonight it’s EMMA AND ANTON! This week they’re dancing the Charleston to ‘Thoroughly Modern Millie’, which is the only musical in this year’s clutch that I haven’t seen on either stage or screen. Having watched a bit on YouTube, it seems to be heavy Jazz Hands, which is definitely Emma and Anton’s happy place. Scores: 10,10,10,10 – a top score of 40 for Karim and Amy. DRINK. Motsi hands Karim her ten paddle and gives him a hug. Shirley thought it was a flawless performance with high quality technique. Bruno has shivers going down his spine – it was a mind-blowing, bravura performance and the best Jive they’ve ever seen on Strictly. Craig is forced to give a standing ovation – tens all round?Karim is rocking the Corny Collins white suit, whilst Amy has a kind of fringy chessboard thing going on, along with weird hair horns. Karim is very much in his element here, some nice kicks and flicks and lovely timing. Is is (as ever) all a bit frantic, but an extraordinary Jive by any standards. I think my biggest issue with this couple is the lack of chemistry – Karim looks like he’s doing his own thing and Amy is just making up the numbers. Just me?Next up it’s KARIM AND AMY! Their Musicals Week choice is a Jive to ‘You Can’t Stop the Beat’ from Hairspray. How has Karim got this far without doing a Jive? This kind of technical detail dance is very Karim, so have high hopes for this after last week’s angsty Couple’s Choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efe537625270dfc25d645ac88556ad9fce4fc14d/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1958ba4be09fc29401e079c444746d69","title":"joe biden iowa tour polls","story":"Former vice-president tours first-voting state in effort ‘to meet as many caucus-goers as I can’Joe Biden has embarked upon an eight-day tour across Iowa as the former US vice-president attempts to arrest his flagging poll numbers in the key state, which is the first to vote in the race to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Biden started his election blitz on Saturday, telling supporters in a fundraising email that he was undertaking an “eight-day, 18 county, ‘No Malarkey’ barnstorm” across Iowa. “The plan is to meet as many caucus-goers as I can, and we’re going to cover a lot of ground to do it,” the email read.The bus tour follows recent polling that shows Biden’s standing has slipped among Democratic voters in Iowa who, on 3 February, will be the first caucus in the US to pick a favored candidate to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.After topping the Democratic field in the state in several polls as recently as September, the 77-year-old has seemingly been eclipsed by Pete Buttigieg in recent surveys of Iowan Democrats. Still, the polls show a tight race and Biden’s supporters deny that his campaign is in any sort of trouble, especially as he still frequently leads the Democratic field in national polls.“As people get closer and closer to February, they become more and more practical about this,” said the former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack, who recently gave Biden his most high-profile Iowa endorsement. “He can make the strongest case, among all the candidates, that he is in a position to get things done, and he is in a position to win.”Biden opened November with an underwhelming speech at the state party’s “Liberty \u0026amp Justice” gala. While Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth Warren roused thousands of supporters in a Des Moines arena, Biden ticked through his standard applause lines as whole sections of seats purchased by his campaign sat empty.In south-east Iowa, the state party’s Rural Caucus vice-chairman says Biden’s footprint isn’t visible. “I know the names of the people who are supporting various other candidates,” Glenn Hurst said. “But in terms of people out there knocking on doors, who attend other campaign events, district events, I can’t name a member of the south-east Iowa Democrats who’s supporting Joe Biden.”Fairly or not, Biden’s national staff has fueled skeptical assessments with pronouncements that he doesn’t have to win Iowa to win the nomination.Iowa is overwhelmingly white Biden’s national advantage leans heavily on non-white voters who help determine outcomes in Nevada, South Carolina and many 3 March Super Tuesday states.Yet all the handwringing misses key variables in Iowa, according to Vilsack and other Biden supporters.They contend that, public enthusiasm aside, Biden has the broadest range of support both demographically and geographically, especially in rural and small-town Iowa and among the growing minority population that, while small, could prove important with so many candidates iding the overall caucus vote.Those Biden organizers that get so much criticism, the campaign says, spend their days not with local party officials, but with volunteers knocking on doors and making calls. Their focus: reliable caucus participants, plus disaffected Republicans and independents.“The media seems to have picked up this narrative that the Biden campaign is not doing well or not as well as it should,” said the longtime party activist and Biden supporter Phyllis Hughes Ewing, daughter of a former Iowa governor and US senator.“I’m on the phones with voters two nights a week for several hours at a pop. I’m a boot on the ground, and that’s not what I’m seeing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10b18275653c60b1512aca3efdc4af8fbd5c5eea/3_0_4827_2897/master/4827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71e46db4c90bf5153545df754e712d8b","title":"thanksgiving weather storm travel","story":"At least one killed as storm moves east from California, stranding drivers as authorities warn travel could be impossibleA powerful storm making its way east across the US from California is causing major disruptions during the year’s busiest travel weekend, as forecasters warned that intensifying snow and ice could thwart millions of people across the country hoping to get home after Thanksgiving.The storm caused the death of at least one person in South Dakota and shut down highways in the western US, stranding drivers in California and prompting authorities in Arizona to plead with travelers to wait out the weather before attempting to travel.The storm was tracking into the lains on Friday and expected to track east through the weekend – into the midwest by Saturday and the north-east on Sunday – pummeling a huge portion of the country with snow, ice or flash flooding.The National Weather Service said travel could become impossible in some places.The weather could be particularly disruptive on Sunday, when millions of holiday travelers head home. Airlines for America, the airline industry’s trade group, expects 3.1 million passengers during what could be the busiest day ever recorded for American air travel.The weather service issued storm warnings Friday for a swath of the country stretching from Montana to Nebraska to Wisconsin, with heavy snow anticipated in parts of Utah, Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming.Gusts up to 90 mph were possible in mountains and foothills, and could reach 65 mph in the Plains, creating poor visibility.Northern Michigan University reopened its residence halls two days earlier than normal for a Thanksgiving weekend, to give students more options as forecasters predicted a foot or more of snow.“We want to make people aware of what they could be driving into,” the campus police chief, Mike Bath, said.The airline industry group estimated a record 31.6 million people will travel over a 12-day holiday period. Airlines on Friday said they were so far operating as usual as they monitored the weather.Delta said inclement weather could disrupt travel at airports in the upper midwest on Saturday and the north-east on Sunday and Monday. It offered to let customers reschedule or cancel flights. American Airlines issued similar waivers for Rapid City, South Dakota.Sections of South Dakota were under a blizzard warning and could see howling winds and as much as 2ft (0.6 meters) of snow. Authorities reported a fatal crash in the state after a driver lost control of his pickup on an ice-covered road. A 37-year-old passenger died after the truck slid into a ditch and rolled.Utah highway patrol troopers were dealing with a “huge smattering” of wrecks across the state starting on Friday afternoon, Sgt Brady Zaugg told the Salt Lake Tribune.The National Weather Service announced on Friday evening that three tornados had hit parts of the Phoenix area early Friday.

And where was Rick Small?The 20ft (6-metre) craft, made with driftwood and polystyrene and fitted with solar panels, had no one at the helm when it turned up at Drum beach, near Belmullet in County Mayo, in November 2016.There was a message written on the ceiling: “I, Rick Small, donate this structure to a homeless youth to give them a better life that Newfoundland chose not to do! No rent, no mortgage, no hydro.”Small was known in Canada as an environmentalist who built solar-powered three-wheeled bikes, but he was elusive and his connection to the boat, and how it crossed the Atlantic, remained unclear.This week the CTV News network found him in Vancouver. “Mystery solved”, he said.The 62-year-old said he built the vessel in 2016 and planned to sail from Newfoundland to the Arctic to raise awareness about the climate crisis and vanishing Arctic ice.But when he failed to source an appropriate motor he gave the boat away. He said he had no idea how it ended up at sea. He expressed pride that it survived a voyage of more than 1,800 miles largely intact. “It didn’t sink. I must have done a good job.”Small said he planned to build another boat after making more solar-powered bikes that he calls Solarized-Its.Volunteers in Mayo refurbished the vessel in 2017. It is now on display in a community garden in the village of Binghamstown a few miles from Drum beach.

Photograph: Eric Luke The Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin has expressed horror at what he describes as “traces of racism” among Ireland’s Roman Catholics community.In a sermon delivered to mark the beginning of Advent on Saturday he expressed grave concern about the “emergence of a new language of racism” in Ireland. He said although it was “at times understated in its expression” it was “nasty in its effects on men and women who need our help, our care and our respect”.He said he was “horrified to find traces of such racism among believers” and suggested that terms including “refugee” and “asylum seeker” should “only arouse heartfelt concern among Christians”. Described Advent as a “season of hope” Dr Martin said it was a time to reflect on the meaning of the “coming of Jesus Christ into human history”. Drawing parallels between the experience of injustice under which the Jewish people of the Middle East lived in pre-Christian times and “the injustice, the evil, the violence” that exists now, the Archbishop said Christians of every generation were “called to be awake and attentive to where society is slipping into wrong ways”.He highlighted the plight of people “burdened by homelessness and poverty, intolerance and discrimination, suffering and anxiety”.And he condemned the “renewed violence on our streets and the callousness of those who feel they can intimidate our society into weakening our opposition to that business of death that is the drug trade”. He said people need to be wary of a “seductive culture” which plays down the “value of each life or which introduces into our culture criteria which would determine that one life has less value than another”. He was speaking as he celebrated Mass in the Church of St Joseph the Artisan, Bonnybrook, in Dublin 17.Racism has been on the rise across Europe in recent years and politicians stoking up fears over immigration have fuelled the rise of populist right-leaning xenophobic parties across Europe. Closer to home local campaigns against direct provision centres, as well as widely condemned comments critical of asylum seekers by Verona Murphy and Noel Grealish, have raised fears that racism t may become a phenomenon here.Ms Murphy secured 23 per cent of the first preference vote in the Wexford byelection.

The results mean Fine Gael has failed to win a seat and this further reduces the Government’s already flimsy majority on confidence votes in the Dáil.With a confidence vote in the Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy due in the Dáil on Tuesday evening, it means that the survival of the Government is now dependent on the votes of independent TDs who have no formal arrangement with Fine Gael Denis Naughten, Noel Grealish, Peter Fitzpatrick and Michael Lowry.The emerging results represent a blow for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar who had pinned his hopes on a win in Dublin Mid West, but a stuttering campaign and huge embarrassment in the party about Wexford candidate Verona Murphy’s comments about immigrants meant that these byelections were even harder than usual to win for an incumbent government.Sinn Féin boostBoth the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe sought to play down the results, but there is little doubt that the results are a disappointment for Fine Gael, if not huge surprise for the party.Fianna Fáil gained one seat with its victories in Wexford and in Cork North Central, where the vacancy was created by the election of Mr Kelleher to the European Parliament in May.The Sinn Féin result in Dublin Mid West was built on an energetic local campaign and a strong get-out-the-vote operation yesterday, which confounded the pattern of record low turnouts elsewhere.It provides a much-needed boost for party leader Mary Lou McDonald after poor local and European elections.The other surprise poll-topping performance of the day was by the Green candidate in Fingal, Joe O’Brien.The Greens Dáil ranks have increased by 50 per cent and encouraging the party to believe a Green wave is possible at next year’s general elections.A clearly delighted Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said on Saturday the votes for the party showed they were the “clear alternative” to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.View current and previous elections and referendums "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4090106.1574285703!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"constituency byelection profile cork north central","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenator Colm Burke: Fine Gael’s main hope in Cork North Central. Photograph: Tom HonanIt may not be exactly the same scenario as 40 years ago when two byelections in Cork city and county delivered an ultimately fatal blow to Jack Lynch’s tenure as taoiseach but next week’s byelection in Cork North Central will be watched closely by both Leo Varadkar and Micheál Martin.Back in November 1979, it was the victory of former Fine Gael TD Liam Burke in Lynch’s home constituency of Cork city which particularly harmed the then taoiseach’s standing.While Fine Gael will be hoping to repeat that feat with Senator Colm Burke (no relation to his late namesake), it is arguably the Fianna Fáil leader who is under more pressure on Leeside given the seat that’s up for grabs is one vacated by party stalwart Billy Kelleher upon his election as an MEP.Notwithstanding the pressure on Martin, most commentators agree that turnout is likely to be low – first because whatever the result, it won’t change the Dáil arithmetic, and second, whatever happens in the byelection will be quickly superseded by a general election in the first six months of 2020.It is as much with a view to the forthcoming general election then that all the main parties are contesting the byelection, with Fianna Fáil pinning their hopes on county councillor Pádraig O’Sullivan from Glanmire to hold its seat in the face of a stiff challenge from Burke, a former city councillor and MEP.The constituency itself is a erse mix with many voters who previously were living in county council territory now finding themselves in the city following a boundary extension which saw satellites towns and villages such as Glanmire, Blarney and Tower all incorporated into the city.That move has resulted in the balance, at least nominally, shifting back towards a more urban constituency with approximately 76 per cent of the 141 voting boxes coming within the city area and 24 per cent from the county. But that figure masks the fact many polling stations within the city boundary are still resolutely rural.Infrastructural needsAside from general issues concerning the health service, housing and anti-social behaviour, the main local issues are infrastructural and the need for definite progress to be made in relation to the long-awaited Northern Ring Road, the M20 Cork-Limerick motorway and a new hospital for the northside.O’Sullivan, who ran as Independent under the New Vision banner in 2011 when he polled just 1,020 votes, or 1.96 per cent, is well-known around his home base of Glanmire and should do well there and in other rural areas. But he has a greater challenge in urban, working-class areas.Burke, who is from Dripsey in the county, should enjoy greater name recognition from his time as an MEP and his time as city councillor from 1999 to 2007 but he was never a poll-topping performer, averaging just over 13 per cent of the vote in his two municipal contests in 1999 and 2004.He may also benefit from a certain sympathy vote in that he was defeated at the 2016 convention by then sitting but now retiring party TD Dara Murphy and the party HQ opted to add newcomer Julie O’Leary rather than Burke to the ticket.Of the other candidates, Cllr Thomas Gould of Sinn Féin looks best-placed. A vociferous campaigner on housing, he accuses both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil of neglecting the northside but he will have to reverse a decline in the party’s support in this year’s local elections if he is to have any chance.The Greens were the success story in the locals in Cork city last May and newly elected Cllr Oliver Moran is their standard-bearer but it remains to be seen if he can win votes in the large working-class areas of the northside or among farmers who are not enamoured of the Greens’ message on the need to reduce cattle numbers.General electionMoran may have his eye more on the next general election and so too will newly elected Labour Cllr John Maher who polled well in the locals to win his party’s sole seat on Cork City Council after the 2014 wipe-out.Solidarity’s Cllr Fiona Ryan, who was co-opted on to Cork City Council to replace party colleague Mick Barry when he was elected to the Dáil in 2016, had to battle hard to hold her seat. Barry will be watching closely her performance particularly in rural areas as an augury of the challenge he faces next time out.Other candidates include James Coughlan of the Workers Party, Sinead Halpin of the Social Democrats and Finian Toomey of Aontú, as well as Independents Martin Condon, Charlie Keddy and Thomas Kiely. Gould, Maher, Moran and Ryan will all be hoping to pick up transfers from them to keep them in the race.Theoretically, it is possible one from this group of broad left candidates could bridge the gap to Burke and O’Sullivan with a good run of transfers but it should really come down to a contest between Fianna Fáil, which polled 27.9 per cent here in the 2016 general election, and Fine Gael, which polled 17.8 per cent.The vote will take place on November 29th, the same date as byelections in three other constituencies – Dublin Fingal, Dublin Mid-West and Wexford.View current and previous elections and referendums "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4100865.1575142855!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cork north central byelection p%C3%A1draig o sullivan holds seat for ff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNewly-elected Fianna Fáil TD Padraig O’Sullivan and party leader Micheál Martin celebrate the party’s byelection win in Cork North Central on Saturday.

The pressure was on because Billy Kelleher had a great record here and we’re delighted that we managed to maintain the share of the vote he had and get it.”“It’s tinged with a small bit of disappointment that turnout was so low because I would have liked more people involved but given the vote share, we are confident it’s put us on a good footing for the general election next year.”A native of Little Island living in Glanmire on the outskirts of Cork city, Mr O’Sullivan teaches Irish and History at Colaiste an Chraoibhin in Fermoy and is married to Bernie. The couple has a nine month old son, Paidi Og.Mr O’Sullivan topped the poll on the first count with 7,148 votes or 27.95 per cent of the vote ahead of Fine Gael’s Colm Burke who came in 21.06 per cent of the poll with 5,385 first preferences.Sinn Féin’s Cllr Thomas Gould put the party’s poor performance in this year’s local elections in both Cork City and Cork County Councils behind him to come in third place with 19.72 per cent of the vote with 5,041 first preferences.Mr O’Sullivan maintained his lead throughout the various counts as independents and candidates from smaller parties were eliminated with Burke maintaining his position in second spot ahead Gould until the seventh count. But with the elimination of Solidarity People Before Profit’s Cllr Fiona Ryan, who polled 4.38 per cent or 1,121 first preferences, Mr Gould picked up 456 transfers to Mr Burke’s 91 to leapfrog the Fine Gael man and move into second place. The elimination on the eighth count of the Green Party’s Cllr Oliver Moran, who polled a credible 7.36 per cent with 1,883 first preferences, saw Mr Burke close the margin to just 64 votes as he picked up 434 Green transfers to 249 for Mr Gould.The ninth count saw the elimination of Labour Cllr John Maher, who took 9.71 per cent of the vote with 2,482 first preferences, with Mr Gould picking up 946 transfers to move to 7,130 compared to 854 for Mr Burke who moved to 6,972.Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin congratulated Mr O’Sullivan on his election and said Fianna Fáil was delighted to hold its seat in Cork North Central but he played down speculation that the win might hasten a general election.“This doesn’t change the trajectory of when an election will happen. I am still looking at the springtime. I think Brexit needs to be sorted first so let’s not run ahead of ourselves,” said Mr Martin.“In Britain, we are not even there yet in terms of a British general election. At the moment, if Boris heads for victory, as it looks like, I think the deal that is on the table will come through on January 31st.”“We will have honoured our commitments then in terms of putting the needs of the Irish people and the national interest first in terms of not having political instability around the Brexit issue.”Meanwhile Tánaiste Simon Coveney acknowledged it was difficult to get people out to vote in a byelection when they know a general election is imminent but he said the result showed Fine Gael were on track to take a seat next time out.“Our focus in Cork North Central was to build Colm Burke’s profile for the general election and to obviously to maximize our vote in a constituency that has been a tough constituency for us in the last few elections“We have gone from 18 per cent to between 21 per cent and 22 per cent so we’re happy enough that. “ I think it puts Colm Burke in a great position going into the next election in terms of his profile across the entire constituency.Mr Coveney said while Fine Gael had increased their vote, Fianna Fáil would also be happy holding their vote as would Sinn Féin who were back to their 2016 level of support unlike SolidarityPeople Before Profit.“I think the story of Cork North Central is the collapse of the hard Left, SolidarityPeople Before Profit- Mick Barry got 16 per cent the last election, they’re at 5 per cent now and the Greens and Labour have gained some of that vote.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4100878.1575146502!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dara murphy insists he complied with attendance rules","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCork North Central TD Dara Murphy: his attendance at the Dáil on sitting days during 2018 and 2019 was the worst of any TD. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsFine Gael TD Dara Murphy has defended his low attendance at Dáil Éireann on sitting days by asserting he is compliant with all rules of attendance at Leinster House.Following a week of criticism about his relatively low Dáil attendance coupled with his claiming of full expenses, even though he has worked outside of the country for much of the last two and a half years, Mr Murphy struck a defiant tone in statement released on Saturday evening.The Cork North Central TD said he had fully complied with the rules and that as a TD he was not precluded from having have another occupation.In his statement Mr Murphy said he “attended the required 120 days at Leinster House in 2018 and should achieve the requisite number for 2019.”For the last two and a half years Mr Murphy’s main career has been in Brussels where he has worked with the European People’s Party, the centre-right group to which Fianna Fáil is aligned.During this period he has drawn his full Dáil salary of €94,5000 and his full parliamentary standard allowances of €51,600 each year.Mr Murphy had the lowest attendance rate in the Dáil on sitting days by a considerable margin during 2018 and 2019 attending on 42 days out of 104 in 2018, and 24 out of 70 until the end of September this year.Mr Murphy is a former Minister of State for European Affairs but was dropped from the position by Leo Varadkar when he became Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael in June 2017.Mr Murphy last spoke in the Dáil in December 2017 and spoke at one committee hearing in October 2018.All TDs are required to sign in on at least 120 days each year to claim their full travel and accommodation allowance.Mr Murphy has made up the deficit of attendance on sitting days by signing in on the electronic fob on non-sitting days, often on the same day as he returned from, or travelled to, Brussels or other European cities.Mr Murphy said on Saturday evening that many of his Dáil colleagues have another occupation, in law, medicine, business or farming.Mr Murphy said his role with EPP meant he “remained in the political environment”.He has been a vice president and was also appointed as its European election campaign director in September 2017.Mr Varadkar on Friday Mr Murphy yesterday saying he should not be subject to trial by media.“I was in contact with Dara earlier today and he’s willing to provide documentation and co-operate with any investigation that may be carried out either by the ethics committee in the Dáil or by the standards commission.“He is not going to be trailed by media but he is willing to co-operate with any statutory investigation and he is willing to stand over the fact that he was present for at least 120 days in Leinster House.”Asked if it was right that TDs were seen as present just by clocking in, Mr Varadkar said “whether it’s right or night I think that is a different matter or debate”.He said there are lots of different ways to calculate these things. “The rules are that non office holders are required to demonstrate their presence by clocking in to Leinster House for 120 days.”He said it was up to the Ceann Comhairle or the Houses of the Oireachtas to review attendance record rules for TDs.Several senior figures in Fine Gael have implicitly criticised Mr Murphy. Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, speaking on RTÉ, said a number of questions had been raised which were in the public interest”.He said it was now incumbent on Mr Murphy to clarify those matters. Party chairman Martin Heydon also said Mr Murphy had questions to answer.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said Mr Murphy had not been active as a TD for the past two years.“It is a serious issue that someone can essentially just not perform for two years, take another job and I think people felt angry about that,” he said.Fianna Fáil whip Michael Moynihan has written to the Committee on Members Interests asking it to begin an investigation into Mr Murphy’s attendance."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4100883.1575148211!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin fingal joe o brien wins green party s first ever byelection","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoe O’Brien: ‘We had the so called green wave in the summer at the local elections, but it’s gaining traction now and I think it’s more than a wave.’ Photograph: Alan BetsonThe The Green Party has won its first ever Dáil byelection as Joe O’Brien emerged as the comfortable victor in Dublin Fingal.Mr O’Brien topped the poll in the 12 candidate field with 5,744 first preference votes, or just under 23 per cent of all first preferences.Turnout in the contest to fill the vacancy created by the election of Clare Daly to the European Parliament was very low at just 25.6 per cent.Mr O’Brien was deemed elected without reaching the quota on the eighth count, with a total vote of 12,315 – just shy of the quota of 12,546 – at the conclusion of the count.Fianna Fáil senator Lorraine Clifford Lee came second and Labour’s Duncan Smith came third on first preference votes and they held their positions until the end of the count.Mr O’Brien’s victory sees him join party leader Eamon Ryan and Dublin Rathdown TD Catherine Martin in the Dáil and builds on a successful local and European elections for the Greens earlier this year.He performed well in areas such as Skerries, Portmarnock and Malahide, an indication that the pattern that support for the Greens is increasing in middle class areas of Dublin, seen in the local and European elections, is holding.Dublin Fingal is a five seat constituency and Mr O’Brien will be well placed to hold his seat at the next election. He is based in Skerries, and the town now is home to three TDs: Mr O’Brien, Labour’s Brendan Ryan and Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly.‘Double and triple’The other two TDs – Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien and Fine Gael’s Alan Farrell – are based in Malahide. Green Party sources said they wanted to beat Labour in this constituency at the byelection to maintain their momentum on the centre left.Speaking after the count concluded at the National Show Centre in Swords, Mr O’Brien said a lot of work had gone into his victory, but said people are “definitely” “changing their minds” on the climate issue.“We had the so called green wave in the summer at the local elections, but it’s gaining traction now and I think it’s more than a wave,” he said. “I think there’s a bit of a sea change in terms of how people are deciding where to put their votes.”Mr Ryan also said there has been a “change in the last year”.“ There is a green wave of thinking. It’s coming from younger people, but older people responding to that as well. Everyone knows now we’re in a climate crisis and a bioersity crisis.“Our job is to present the practical solutions that will allow us changes the country for the best in responding to those crises.”The Dublin Bay South TD said the number of Green TDs will increase in the next Dáil if the pattern of the past year is continued.He said he and Ms Martin were looking forward to having Mr O’Brien as a third TD.“I’d like to double and triple that again in the next election, and I think we can.

Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsCork North Central TD Dara Murphy has claimed his full parliamentary and travel allowances of €4,300 per month despite not having spoken in the Dáil for almost two years.Mr Murphy is expected to take up a new post as deputy head of cabinet for Bulgarian EU commissioner Mariya Gabriel in December. If he is appointed to the position he will be required to resign from the Dáil.However, Mr Murphy has been based in Brussels for the past two years, where he has worked as campaign manager for the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre-right grouping to which Fine Gael is aligned.Mr Murphy has attended the Dáil on 24 of the 70 sitting days this year. Most of the days he has been present have been Thursdays, the day most votes are cast.He has the lowest attendance record of all 158 TDs.However, Mr Murphy has been recorded as being present in Leinster House on 55 non-sitting days – among the highest of all TDs.Most of these days have been Mondays and Fridays, when he was en route to, or returning from, Brussels or other European cities. The 55 days includes 12 days in August.Given that he is in what is known as “Band 8” because of his Cork base, he is entitled to €51,600 annually in allowances, in addition to his €94,000 TD’s salary.Mr Murphy has two Twitter accounts. Of more than 1,000 tweets he posted in the past 18 months, no more than 20 have related to his work as a TD.Fobbing systemThe datelines of his tweets suggest he was in locations such as Malta, Warsaw, Brussels and Paris on days he signed in on the Dáil electronic fobbing system. This suggests he recorded his attendance on the fobbing system either after flying back from, or before flying out to, those destinations.His last contribution to a Dáil debate was on December 7th, 2017. He spoke at a meeting of the Petitions Committee in October 2018, his only appearance at the committee during 2018 and 2019.He put down five written parliamentary questions in 2019. Most TDs would ask hundreds in the course of a calendar year.Mr Varadkar said: “I think the timing of his resignation from the Dáil is a matter for him, not for me, and I haven’t discussed that with him.”Non-participationQuestioned about Mr Murphy’s non-participation in the Dáil, the Taoiseach said: “He’s been very busy over the past two years. Not just as a TD representing his constituency locally, he has been present for key votes. But his main job has been a European job in the past two years, and he’s done that extremely well.”Sinn Féin’s Jonathan O’Brien also represents Cork North Central. He said he had not seen Mr Murphy in the constituency for a long time, and only once or twice in the Dáil over the past 18 months.Attempts to contact\u0026nbsp Mr Murphy were not successful.

Reports from all four constituencies during the day suggested that turnout could struggle to exceed 30 per cent, less than half what would be expected in a general election.Bad weather in some constituencies yesterday and a widely-observed lack of interest among voters during the campaign are likely to have contributed to the lack of voter turnoutReports suggested that turnout in Cork might reach the mid-30s, and while in Wexford some areas were also registering a turnout into the 30s. Turnout was even lower in parts of the two Dublin constituencies voting today, with some observers expected a record low.Both the Green Party and Labour have targeted Fingal as a possible gain, while Independent councillor Paul Gogarty has been tipped in Dublin Mid-West.Sinn Féin is hoping for a strong vote in Cork North-Central and in Wexford, where its candidate Johnny Mythen narrowly missed out on a seat at the last general election – but, like other Sinn Féin candidates, saw his vote collapse at the local elections in May. The party hopes this election could mark the start of a revival.Many observers will be closely watching the vote of the Fine Gael candidate in Wexford, Verona Murphy, whose adverse comments about immigrants caused controversy. However, all parties admit that the combination of a low turnout and lack of voter engagement mean that the outcomes today are highly unpredictable.View current and previous elections and referendums "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4088575.1574186345!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"on the canvass byelection in dublin fingal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil’s Lorraine Clifford-Lee meeting Anne O’Connor while canvassing in Portmarnock for the Dublin Fingal byelection. Photograph: Nick BradshawFrom the moment Clare Daly was elected to the European Parliament in May, Fianna Fáil’s Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee was installed as front-runner in this race.Yet even without her moment of Twitter notoriety last week, the general problem for Fianna Fáil is transfers. Of the 18 byelections held over the past 21 years, Fianna Fáil has won only one – Bobby Aylward in Carlow-Kilkenny in 2015.Fingal is a Dublin constituency, but it is as rural as it is urban. As you drive from Portmarnock to Swords up through the Naul and into Balbriggan you see the contrasts – the jets descending into its biggest employer Dublin Airport the pretty seaside commuter towns the fertile lands dotted with greenhouses the immigrant communities.It’s the youngest constituency in the country, and the fastest growing. There are huge pressures for services, and a sense of straining at the seams.Clifford-Lee has built up a high profile on the liberal wing of Fianna Fáil. Some of that has been undone by the emergence of her tweets from 2011 with derogatory references to Travellers. She has spent much of the time since then apologising.On the doorsteps of Woodlands in Portmarnock, a pleasant estate built in the 1990s, she gets a broadly warm welcome. A few identify her for the comments, including one who says she is “the girl who was giving out about” Travellers. She apologises again.Good receptionWhat about former minister for health James Reilly? He has been out canvassing with Leo Varadkar, but it is the Taoiseach who is getting all the attention and the selfies. “I’m getting a good reception,” says Reilly.He has made a new 40-bed day hospital in Swords, with eight operating theatres, a central plank of his campaign. “It’s really grabbing attention,” he says.Government TDs do not tend to fare well in byelections, and there is no reason this will be an exception. So what candidates are in the strongest position?At this juncture the two who look like they might go the distance are Joe O’Brien of the Green Party and Duncan Smith of Labour. This constituency was one of the few which returned a Labour TD in 2016, and, as Smith points out, it came second only to Fianna Fáil in the local elections.He is full of energy as he canvasses Castle Grange mid-afternoon. It is a working class estate in Swords that was hostile to Labour in 2016, but seems to have come back. “We have a chance of winning,” says Smith. “There’s a good few people in the hunt. If we win it will be a big shock for others but not for us.”O’Brien topped the poll in Skerries. He and a small team is canvassing around Ormonde in Swords. A low-key Cork native, he has long ago absorbed doorstep discussions.CommittedThe Clare Daly-backed candidate is Dean Mulligan, a councillor from River Valley and a social worker. He is still in his 20s, clearly committed with a friendly demeanour.Others would say his profile is not sufficiently high. He disagrees. “As a younger person, one quarter of the population is under 24. There is a huge disconnect between politicians in power and young people out there.”Well-regarded councillor Ann Graves is the standard bearer for Sinn Féin, but the party’s falling support levels in June will mean its bigger battle here will be trying to retain Louise O’Reilly’s seat.Tracey Carey is standing for Social Democrats, and there are a number of other Independent candidates: Gemma O’Doherty, Cormac McKay, Glenn Brady, Charlie Keddy and Peadar O’Kelly."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4100873.1575144996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"wexford byelection fianna f%C3%A1il s malcolm byrne tops poll","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMalcom Byrne: ‘Racism and the language of hate and ision has no place in Wexford politics.

But that’s what happened when three supporters of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong agreed to be interviewed. All living in Dublin, two are from Hong Kong and the other from the Chinese mainland.“They are killing people,” a woman from Hong Kong says soon after the interview began. “That is what is happening now. The Hong Kong government, and the police, they are really killing people.”Each of the interviewees is concerned about the potential consequences should it become known that they had spoken with the Irish media. One has already had the experience of losing her job with a Chinese employer in Dublin after her image attending a protest here was posted on Chinese social media.Over the past fortnight, The  has been speaking with people from the Tibetan and Hong Kong communities about living in Ireland while being careful not to come to the attention of the Beijing authorities. No one from the small Irish community of Uighur Turkic Muslims, from the northwestern province of Xinjiang, would agree to be interviewed.The Chinese government is believed to have incarcerated a million or more Uighur and other Turkic Muslims in re-education camps in Xinjiang, as part of a massive campaign of repression.“The high level of persecution spreads fear to the extent that Muslims living abroad are reluctant to talk about it lest members of their family at home should face serious repercussions,” said Dr Ali Selim, of the Islamic Cultural Centre, in Clonskeagh, where some the Uighurs attend the mosque.For people who have family back in China, being identified as expressing views Beijing does not approve of can have significant consequences, these activists claim. People who live here can find it hard to get visas to visit family, they say. Family members back in China can be punished for what a family member has said here in Ireland, they claim. And people here temporarily fear the consequences for themselves once they return home.This week, leaked Chinese Communist Party (CCP) documents – the China Cables – gave new insight into what is happening in Xinjiang.The classified documents were given to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which shared them with a number of its media partners, including The .Among other matters, the documents show how the Chinese government uses its international diplomatic network as part of the campaign in Xinjiang.People from Xinjiang living abroad who have dealings with China’s embassy and consulate network are flagged for attention by a computerised surveillance system, the leaks show. The very fact that these people are abroad is sufficient reason for them or their families to be treated with suspicion, and become candidates for detention.The Chinese man from the mainland, who supports the protesters in Hong Kong, believes the wider Chinese community in Ireland is also part of a monitoring network. “They have a lot of spies,” he says. Some spy because they are asked to, he says. Others do it because they love China and CCP. “They don’t see a difference between China and the party, but the party is very evil. It is a dictatorship.”All three pro-democracy protesters say they fear that people who are being arrested in Hong Kong might end up in re-education camps similar to those in Xinjiang. “We do not know what will happen in the future.” An interviewee who grew up in Hong Kong says that, even going to school there during the period of British rule, people didn’t learn the truth about Chinese history. “The CCP has killed more Chinese people than the Japanese did during the second World War,” the activists say. “No one knows this.”Even educated Chinese people living here try not to learn the truth. “They are afraid to speak freely, even when they are here, in Ireland. They are brainwashed.”In a cafe in south Dublin, two men who were born in Tibet but who now live in Ireland agree to talk as long as they are not identified. Both have family in Tibet.Tibet lies below Xinjiang in western China. Like Xinjiang, Tibet has experienced extensive settlement by the majority Han Chinese in recent decades. It is also, like Xinjiang, the subject of a campaign of mass surveillance and repression by a Beijing government that fears separatist sentiment and loyalty to the Dalai Lama.“They started in Xinjiang recently, but it’s been going on for a long, long time in Tibet. I am here for . . . years and I have family in Tibet, but I never dare talk to them.”The situation eased a decade or more ago, but since the rise to the top of the CCP by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in 2013, the situation has changed for the worse.Getting visas to go back for family visits can be difficult. Family members have to sign letters saying the visitor will not “destabilise the motherland and disturb the social harmony. They have to guarantee it.”“I never went back. It’s hard for me to contact them. I am in the free world, but they are not.”The men have friends in Ireland from mainland China.The Chinese authorities use local Chinese-Irish associations and student groups, the activists claim. Such organisations have people from the CCP in them who keep an eye on everyone, they say. “That is how they manipulate people when they are outside China. It is not obvious. It’s sneaky.”CSSAs “receive guidance from the CCP through Chinese embassies and consulates—governmental ties CSSAs frequently attempt to conceal—and are active in carrying out overseas Chinese work consistent with Beijing’s United Front strategy,” the report says.Authoritarian Advance, a report published last year by the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, gave details as to the European network of CSSAs. “The CSSAs report to Chinese embassies on Chinese students who take part in activities that are considered sensitive by the Chinese government”, the report says. “These students and their families at home can face retaliation in the form of threats from Chinese officials.”There are CSSA branches in UCD, NUI Galway, and DCU, and the Waterford Institute of Technology. The Irish website of the organisation is listed on the website of the Chinese embassy in Dublin. Efforts to contact the Irish association by email (its website lists no phone numbers) had received no response at the time of going to press.The Berlin think-tank makes the point that it is important not to conflate the Chinese party-state with overseas Chinese communities, something the CCP itself is keen on doing, the report says, so it can present the party’s interests as being the same as those of all ethnic Chinese.A statement from the Chinese embassy in Dublin in response to the points raised in this article reads as follows: “We respect the legal right of expression of all Chinese, no matter where they are or which part of China they are from.It continues: “Regarding those Chinese who told you that their freedom of expression is threatened by other Chinese, I am afraid they are either suffering from persecutory delusion or trying to gain sympathy in an attempt to discredit or smear the majority of Chinese in Ireland with opinions different from them.”“Kate”, who is from Hong Kong, has lived in Ireland for a number of years, and has family in Hong Kong. She is, she says, not just pro-democracy but pro-independence. “So I am quite scared of the Chinese people finding out about me.”For her, China is not a country but an empire made up of 56 countries, including Tibet. She refers to Xinjiang – the word means New Territory – as “East Turkistan”, a name she believes is more appropriate. “It is quite dangerous to have Chinese friends. I think of them as Chinese agents.” Most Chinese people see those in favour of an independent Hong Kong as traitors, she says.“I think the Chinese in Ireland embrace the CCP. They love the CCP. They think that without the CCP, they would be still living in poverty. They are against the independence movements of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet. They stand with the CCP.”Chinese people, she says, fear that if the CCP collapsed, China would collapse, and this would be bad for them. They want the CCP to remain in power.\u0026nbsp“Leftists say they are anti-imperialists, but they turn a blind eye to Chinese imperialism. I see people talking about Palestine, Catalonia, the Kurds, but they never seem to support the Uighurs. So I wonder do they just not know about it, or do they just pretend nothing is happening?”“I am not saying it is a competition between who deserves the most pity. A death in East Turkistan is the same as a death in Palestine.”She wonders if it is because China is ruled by the CCP. “The Soviet Union has collapsed. Maybe if China collapsed, then leftist ideology would no longer stand. Maybe. But it is a kind of hypocrisy.”The Oireachtas website shows that the word Uighur has been mentioned four times this year in the Dáil and Seanad. Other searches show: Xinjiang (0) Kurd (25) Catalonia (12) and Palestine (109).For a lot of Chinese people, coming to the West and being exposed to western media and political debate makes them view China more rather than less positively, according to Isabella Jackson, an assistant professor in Chinese history in Trinity College Dublin.“Chinese people are used to a relentlessly positive approach to news and current affairs in the media at home and are taken aback by the negative news reported in the media every day in the West. It shows them all the things that are wrong with society here, reinforcing a sense that the Chinese government broadly has things right. It can be a relief to get back to the familiarity of Chinese culture.”She says it often takes time for Chinese students to get to grips with the idea of multiple interpretations of political and historical issues, as against a single, dogmatic, state-sponsored viewpoint.“On issues like the treatment of minorities in Xinjiang, Chinese people’s initial assumption is often that news that contrasts with the Chinese government’s line is a result of western propaganda.“While some start to question the Communist state narrative, others end up trusting no news source, unable to discern what might be true between conflicting Chinese and western stories.”Colm Keena is the Legal Affairs Correspondent with The .

Their story was passed between tea sellers and rickshaw drivers and shopkeepers in Old Delhi: In a forest, they said, in a palace cut off from the city that surrounds it, lived a prince, a princess and a queen, said to be the last of a storied Shia Muslim royal line.There were different versions, depending on whom you spoke to. Some people said the Oudh family had been there since the British had annexed their kingdom, in 1856, and that the forest had grown up around the palace, engulfing it. Some said they were a family of jinns, the supernatural beings of Arabian folklore.An acquaintance who had once glimpsed the princess through a telephoto lens said her hair had not been cut or washed for so many years that it fell to the ground in matted branches. One thing was sure: They didn’t want company. They lived in a 14th-century hunting lodge, which they surrounded with loops of razor wire and ferocious dogs. The perimeter was marked with menacing signs. INTRUDERS SHALL BE GUNDOWN, said one.Macabre storiesEvery few years, the family agreed to admit a journalist, always a foreigner, to tell of their grievances against the state. The journalists emerged with deliciously macabre stories, which I had studied admiringly. In 1997, the prince and the princess told The Times of London that their mother, in a final gesture of protest against the treachery of Britain and India, had killed herself by drinking a poison mixed with crushed diamonds and pearls.I could see why these stories resonated so. The country was imprinted with trauma, by the epic deceit of the British conquest and then the blood bath of the British departure, known as Partition, which carved out Pakistan from India and set off convulsions of Hindu-Muslim violence.This family, displaying its own ruin, was a physical representation of all that India had suffered.A few grainy photographs of the siblings had been published: They were beautiful, pale and high-cheekboned, but also somehow ravaged, harrowed. Nearly every day, dropping my children at school, I drove past the narrow road that led into the middle of the forest, which was surrounded by an ornate wrought-iron fence. The woods were so thick that it was impossible to see much, and inhabited by gangs of monkeys. At night, you could hear jackals howling.The day after I got the message, I dialled the phone number. After a few rings, someone picked up, and I heard a high-pitched, quavering voice on the other end. On the following Monday, I asked our driver to take me into the woods at 5.30 in the afternoon, as instructed.The woods themselves were a bit magical, a thicket in the middle of a city of 20 million. British colonial officers had introduced mesquite trees in the 19th century, and they spread rapidly, swallowing pastures and roads and villages – everything that had been there before. Biologists would later describe it as a “massive invasion” by an “alien species”.We drove farther, until the tree canopy was tormented, thick enough to block out the light.Reader, I should confess that I wanted to write the story. That week, the contents of my inbox were not inspiring: There had been a fire at an ammunition depot. There were budget reports, an unending cycle of state and local elections, the introduction of a goods and services tax.These events, which filled so many of my days at that time, did not entirely satisfy my literary urge. The House of Oudh, now that was a story!Leave the carThe person on the phone had told me to leave the car at the end of the road, beside the high wall of an Indian military compound, and to come alone. This did not surprise me: The Oudh family refused, famously, to meet with Indians. I asked the driver to wait at a distance and stood in the woods, somewhat awkwardly, holding my notebook and wondering what came next.Then the bushes rustled, and a man appeared. He was elfin and wore high-waisted mom jeans. He had high cheekbones with hollows beneath them and wild gray hair that stood up in tufts.“I am Cyrus,” the prince said. It was the high-pitched voice I had heard on the phone.He spoke in bursts, like a person who spent most of his time alone. Then he turned and led me into the woods. I tried to keep up, stepping over a tangle of roots and thorns, and climbed a flight of massive stone stairs leading to the old hunting lodge. It was half-ruined, open to the air, and surrounded by metal gratings one steel bar was loose, and the prince moved it aside with a great clank so that we could enter.I stepped into spare, medieval grandeur, a bare stone antechamber lined with palm trees in brass pots and faded, once-elegant carpets. On the wall hung an oil painting of the prince’s mother swathed in voluminous, dark robes, her eyes closed as if in a trance.The prince led me up to the roof to show me the view. We stopped at the edge of the building, gazing across green treetops to the dusty city, shimmering in the heat. Other great cities may be built on top of ruins, but Delhi is built of them. It is almost impossible to go from one point to another without stumbling over a 700-year-old tomb or a 500-year-old fort.Seven successive Muslim dynasties built their capitals here, each swept aside when its time had passed. The ruins are a reminder that the present dispensation – democracy, Starbucks, Hindu nationalism – is only the blink of an eye in India. We were here, they seem to breathe. This was ours.My idea was to interview the prince and write the story. When I asked about his family, he launched into an animated speech about the perfidy of the British and Indian governments. I recognised quotes from articles I had read, written by colleagues from the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times. He ranted a little, complaining of persecution by a criminal gang. He was flinging his hands wide, declaiming and then dropping to a dramatic whisper, as he spoke of the decline of the house of Oudh.“I am shrinking,” he said. “We are shrinking. The princess is shrinking. We are shrinking.”When I asked if I could publish our interview, he balked. For this, he said, I would need the permission of his sister, Princess Sakina, who was not in Delhi. I would have to come back.It struck me as strange, though. Why summon a journalist if you don’t want to be written about?How it beganThe story began with his mother. She appeared, on the platform of New Delhi’s train station in the early 1970s, seemingly from nowhere, announcing herself as Wilayat, Begum of Oudh.Oudh (pronounced Uh-vud) was a kingdom that no longer existed. The British annexed it in 1856, a trauma from which its capital, Lucknow, never recovered. The core of the city is still made of Oudh’s vaulted shrines and palaces. The begum declared that she would stay in the station until these properties had been restored to her.She settled in the VIP waiting room, and unloaded a whole household there: carpets, potted palms, a silver tea set, Nepali servants in livery, glossy Great Danes. She also had two grown children, Prince Ali Raza and Princess Sakina, a son and a daughter who appeared to be in their 20s. They addressed her as “Your Highness.”The begum was an arresting-looking woman, tall and broad-shouldered, with a face as craggy and immobile as an Easter Island statue. She wore a sari of dark, heavy silk and kept a pistol in its folds. She and her children settled on red plastic chairs, and waited. For years.“Sitting, sitting like yogis,” recalled Father John, a Catholic charity worker who distributed food in the train station. The children were strangely submissive, he said, reluctant even to accept a banana without their mother’s permission.“They were more obedient than the dogs,” he said. “They were absolutely under her control.”The begum’s behaviour was imperious and dramatic. She refused direct conversation, demanding that queries be written on embossed stationery, placed on a silver platter and carried to her by a servant, who read them aloud. If the station master gave her any trouble, she threatened to kill herself by drinking snake venom.“The Nepali servants, they would walk on their knees,” said Saleem Kidwai, a historian who sought them out at the time.Government officials scrambled to find her somewhere to live. She was attracting attention from the media, and officials feared the Shia population in Lucknow could explode into civil unrest if they believed she was being abused.“It was such a romantic image,” Kidwai said. “She is out of the castle, now living in the railway station.”Ammar Rizvi, an aide to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, was sent to New Delhi as a liaison. He recalled handing Wilayat an envelope with 10,000 rupees – about $90,000 at the time – so that they could set up a household in Lucknow.“In 1975, that was a big sum,” he recalled. “But she got angry and threw the envelope. The notes were flying everywhere, and my public relations officer had to catch this note here, that note there. She said no, she would not go, the amount was very little.”In the months that followed, Rizvi tried to persuade the begum to accept a four-bedroom house in Lucknow, but she refused, saying it was too small. He was getting anxious. Muslims were mobilising once, Rizvi visited during Muharram, an annual ritual of mourning, and found her surrounded by pilgrims, flagellating themselves with chains to which razor blades had been attached.“Poor passengers, they were looking at the whole scene,” he said. “There was blood all over the place.”Making her caseAround this time, Wilayat identified a far more effective way to make her case: foreign correspondents. “India Princess Reigns in Rail Station”, a Times correspondent wrote in 1981, describing her “genuine commitment to redeem the ancestors, to right wrongs suffered over centuries and to obtain justice”.People magazine recorded her declaring, “Let the world know how the descendant of the last nawab of Oudh is treated.”Foreign correspondents arrived, one after another, and readers began to send letters from all corners of the world, expressing outrage on her behalf. The begum imposed stringent conditions – she “could only be photographed when the moon was waning”, United Press International reported – and journalists complied, delighted with the Gothic peculiarity of it all.In 1984, her efforts paid off. Prime minister Indira Gandhi accepted their claim, granting them use of a 14th-century hunting lodge known as Malcha Mahal. They left the train station roughly a decade after they first appeared there. Wilayat never appeared in public again.My responsibilities in New Delhi included a great many diplomatic receptions and buffet dinners, which I found exhausting. It was like being drawn into an imperial court, in which every personal relationship was a series of transactions – exchanges, usually, of bits of status for bits of information. I did not have the clothes for this kind of work, or the personality.So I found it a relief to drive into the forest and sit on Cyrus’s porch, eating pistachios and watching motes of pollen circulate in the sunlight. In a meandering, roundabout way, I was trying to excavate his past. I felt flattered that he allowed me in, again and again, when so many others had been turned away.And yet something also nagged at me about the little family unit, the way they seemed to have scoured away any relationships from before their appearance at the train station.LucknowWhen our conversations had gone on for about nine months, I travelled to Lucknow, a large city in northern India that was the cradle of the Oudh dynasty. I was there to interview detectives for an unrelated story, but I knew that Cyrus had lived there with his mother and sister in the 1970s, so I went to the neighbourhood where I had heard that Oudh descendants lived.There, to my surprise, the old-timers remembered Cyrus and his family. But they told me, almost as an aside, that they had been dismissed as impostors. The Oudh descendants in Kolkata, where the nawab died in exile, had also rejected their claim. And there were questions Cyrus himself seemed unable to answer. Where was he born? Who was his father? How do you crush diamonds, anyway?His sister, Princess Sakina, had not turned up but he gave me a book that she had written, documenting their lives. The book was almost unreadable, haphazardly capitalised, lacking punctuation and written in florid, apocalyptic prose. But sprinkled in the rambling text were flashes of genuine tenderness between the siblings, as if they were two small children, stranded together on a lifeboat.Sakina wrote that she had intended to follow her mother into suicide, but for her brother. The question of his future nagged at her. “ABOUT PRINCE CYRUS RIZA MY BROTHER WHAT STEP SHALL HE FOLLOW?” it says. “MY SILENT SINCEREST SILENCE HAS A WISH THAT PRINCE SHOULD BE BLESSED WITH HAPPINESS.”One night Cyrus called me, howling unintelligibly, to tell me that his sister had in fact died seven months earlier. He had told no one, burying her body himself. He had lied to me about it for months, and seemed a bit ashamed by it. I curled up on my daughter’s bunk bed and listened to his voice over the phone. He said that I should never visit again, and also that he was so lonely.I waited a few days, and then showed up with a Filet O’ Fish from McDonald’s. Our relationship seemed to knit itself back together. He asked me to procure him a gun and a girlfriend, which I did not and a tarpaulin and a recording of Fiddler on the Roof, which I did. He was solicitous and a little corny, with pop culture references that seemed to date from the 1960s.Once, he asked me to kiss him on the cheek – his skin felt fragile, like tissue paper – and he told me that it was the first time he had been kissed in 10 years. “When you are over here, my heart goes doopity doo, Sophia Loren,” he said.He even said I could write something about him, as long as I didn’t go into much detail. “I have to tell the truth,” I told him. “Okay, you have to tell the truth,” he said. “Then again, there is a hole in the bucket, Harry Belafonte.”Final conversationsWe had been debating this for 15 months, and I was due to leave India soon and take up a new assignment in London. This sort of exchange made up the balance of our final conversations: I was trying to get him to reveal something about his origins – anything, really – and he was twisting away from me.“You are just a very mysterious person, because I don’t know who you are,” I said once. His response was coy. “Oh, really,” he said, in a singsong voice. “Well, anyway. Oh, really? If you have said me mysterious, I am just sitting before you.”In our last conversation, a few hours before I boarded a flight for London, he asked me how someone could get word to me, should he die. I asked if he planned to take his own life.“So far, I am going to preserve myself,” he said. “Good. Well, then, I’ll see you again,” I said.I think I hugged him goodbye. The last I saw of him, he was replacing the clanking iron bars that protected him from intruders.Three months later, I was in an airport, on my way home from interviewing the Swedish foreign minister, when I learned Cyrus had died. I got the news on Facebook messenger, from a friend at the BBC.I put down my bag and sat on the airport floor, feeling a little in shock. This feeling was partly selfish. I had a thick file of interviews in a manila envelope labelled “Prince Cyrus”.I had figured that, in this family’s story, there was a parable about India, something about trauma that went unresolved as one empire replaced another.And then there was a second feeling. I was sad that I was not there to help him. I had enjoyed our conversations, the maddening dance of 18 months. I could not believe that he had died alone in that forsaken place. I was sure that in the dark, he had wanted someone to hold his hand. Thinking about this made it difficult to breathe. I stayed there for a moment, in the corridor at the airport, while people hurried past, rolling suitcases behind them.It was the guards at the military facility next door – they called him “rajah”, or king – who later recounted how he had died. Three weeks after we said goodbye, Cyrus was seen trying to wheel his bicycle down the road, shaking violently. An electrician from the military facility helped him to his feet, and he staggered back to the hunting lodge. He asked for a bottle of lemonade and an ice cream.Rajinder Kumar, one of the guards, said it seemed to be dengue fever. I’ve had dengue. It’s like being wiped off the face of the Earth. For me, it began with a penetrating ache in my shoulder, and then, as I sweated through the hotel sheets, hallucinations. My senses were altered. When I drank water from the tap, it tasted like a mouthful of tin.I don’t know what Cyrus hallucinated. His illness may have progressed into haemorrhagic fever, with bleeding from the gums and nose, and under the skin. Patients dying of haemorrhagic fever sometimes have such low blood pressure that no pulse can be detected. Rajinder said Cyrus had refused to be taken to the hospital.“Madam, I really tried very hard,” he said. “I said we would call the police, we would take you to the hospital, but no, no, no. We are outsiders, third-party people, we can’t apply that kind of pressure. Had we been family we could have just taken his hand and taken him.”Rajinder thought it came down to pride. “He used to have the attitude that he was the king,” he said. “That is why he did not want to go to the hospital, that he did not want to be a normal person.”His illness lasted eight days. A boy, sent up to check on his welfare, saw him stalking the property half-clothed, naked from the waist down, or shivering under a mosquito net. Then, after a day or so, no one saw him, and the boy found him dead, curled on the rock floor.Back to Malcha MahalI climbed the stone stairs to Malcha Mahal several months later with a kind of curiosity that was in some ways like greed. I had returned to India for a few days, to see what I could find among his possessions.It is legitimate to ask why I was doing all this. I asked it myself. “Is Cyrus a white whale?” was the subject line of an email I sent my editor. I had become curious – Okay, obsessively curious – about how a family with wealth and status had become lost in the forest. About who they were. Stories like that had always flipped a switch in me, spilling outside the boundaries of the assignment. Something similar had happened to me once, years before, when I pieced together the life story of a woman who had stabbed her children in a basement.When I felt I was making progress it was a calming feeling, as if a cloud of buzzing, disparate information were being forced through a funnel, into a clear stream. Small breakthroughs would drive me forward, like a gambler. On such assignments it was possible to forget unpaid bills, unanswered telephone calls, to set aside anything not required to follow the trail.Cyrus and his family had lived through a great historical rupture: the country’s ision. My sense was that the answer lay there, in an act of government that disrupted the lives of half a continent. But what made me think I could track them down after all these years? Say I did – what could be more interesting than the story they told about themselves?This is what was going through my head as I climbed those stairs. Cyrus’s death had received lots of media coverage, inside India and abroad, and thrill-seekers had tramped through Malcha Mahal, taking video with their phones, hoping to see a ghost. The floor of the entry hall was a havoc of discarded papers that had been dumped from the wardrobe and chest of drawers.I leafed through the letters, looking for a birth certificate, a passport, something that anchored this family in the factual world. What I found instead was a chronicle of 30 years of interactions with journalists. This, it seemed, was the family business. There were dozens of requests from reporters. I have written enough letters of this kind in my life to recognise their pleading tone. Some were written in elaborate, courtly language. Others offered money.Sitting there on the carpet, I laughed out loud. Cyrus and his family would string them along – as he had strung me along – and then, when the mood struck them, disdainfully refuse the interview. The Oudhs were the ones with the story. They had the upper hand.Among the family papers was a column from The Statesman, published in 1993, with the headline “When History Is Based on Errors”. Two paragraphs had been marked.“Have you noticed that a factual error appearing in respected printed form tends to be copied by other researchers in the same field, until, inevitably, it competes with the truth for credibility?” it read. “The writers who perpetuate these mistakes rarely do so from evil motive: They have no axe to grind, they simply do not have time to check and double-check each fact, so they rely on the scholarship of their predecessors.”Two things genuinely surprised me. The first was a stack of receipts for regular, small transfers of cash through Western Union from a city in the industrial north of England. The sender identified himself as a “half brother”.A letterThe other thing was a letter. It was handwritten on fragile, blue airmail stationery and sent in 2006. It was cranky yet intimate, conveying both annoyance and concern, a letter that could only have been written by a relative.“I am in so much pain that I cannot go to the toilet even,” the writer began, and, after an extensive catalogue of physical ailments, went on to complain about the burden of providing continuous financial support for Wilayat and her children. He was obviously not a rich man.“For God’s sake, try to sort yourselves out financially, in case anything goes wrong with me,” the writer told them, appending information for the latest Western Union transfer. “May God help us all.” The letter was signed “Shahid”, and it was sent from an address in Bradford, Yorkshire.Let us pause, for a moment, to consider the tragedy of the house of Oudh. In the mid-19th century, the British East India Co had accelerated its consumption of Indian kingdoms. Having guzzled Punjab and Sindh, it set its ambitions on Oudh, a territory roughly the size of South Carolina.Oudh was ruled at the time by a nawab, or provincial governor, named Wajid Ali Shah, a dreamy aesthete who spent his time orchestrating lavish entertainments in a harem that he called the Parikhana, or “abode of fairies”. He thought the British were his allies, because his great-uncle had extended them vast loans.The British thought otherwise. They stripped the nawab of his kingdom on the grounds of mismanagement, thrusting into his hands a treaty declaring that “the territories of Oude shall be henceforth vested for ever, in the Honorable East India Company”.The nawab wept, solemnly removed his turban and placed it in the envoy’s hands. Soon thereafter, he set off for exile in Calcutta, and Lucknow was cast into mourning, the historian Rosie Llewellyn-Jones recalls in her biography of Wajid Ali Shah.“The body of the town was left soulless,” Zahuruddin Bilgrami wrote at that time. “Grief rained down from every door and wall. There was no lane, bazaar, or dwelling which did not wail in our full agony of separation.”The nawab’s mother, in seclusion, sailed to Britain in a desperate attempt to plead her case with Queen Victoria, something the wags at Punch magazine found hilarious:The Queen of Oude Is disendowed Of regions rich and juicy Their milk and honey I mean their money Squeezed out by Lord Dalhousie Oudh was finished. The vanished kingdom would hang over Lucknow like a pall.Haunted cityI returned to Lucknow, and took a cab to a warren of residential streets tucked behind the grand shrines and palaces of the old city.This is where I had encountered witnesses who could remember Cyrus and his family. Horses pulled carts through the narrow lanes, and I could hear tinny music playing on a radio. Nostalgia for Oudh was a cottage industry here. Everywhere I went, I saw the image of the last nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, his expression dreamy, one nipple poking out of his shirt.Then there were the descendants. Because Wajid Ali Shah had hundreds of wives and concubines, people identifying themselves as descendants are all over the place in Lucknow, fighting like polecats over the veracity of one another’s claims.When I asked about the family, I encountered instant recognition: Yes, three of them had moved into this complex for a few months in the 1970s. Abrar Hussain, who had worked for Wilayat as a servant, said the family had caused a sensation, especially among Shias. Ordinary people were moved to tears at the sight of them, and some were so awed by the begum – so convinced that she was their returning queen – that they refused to turn their backs to her, walking backward, out of respect.“It wasn’t just me – the whole public was coming to see her, and was going crazy,” he said. “People would cry to see her in this condition.”But the older men who presided over the neighbourhood, mostly descendants of members of the nawab’s court, said the family were impostors. Sayyed Suleiman Naqvi, a former code-breaker for the Indian army, said he had posed as a journalist in order to check Wilayat’s credentials.“She said, ‘We have got documentary evidence.’ I said, ‘Get it.’ She said, ‘I will give it only to those persons who are in authority.’ She showed us certain pieces of crockery and all that, which were of course antiques,” recalled Naqvi, now in his late 70s. “But she did not show us any documents.”The family left Lucknow abruptly, he said. Something had happened: An elderly aunt said she recognised Wilayat from before Partition. The aunt said Wilayat was an ordinary woman then, the young wife of a civil servant. Naqvi, who considers himself a keen student of human nature, said he believed they were frauds, but that they were not motivated by greed.“To my mind, this lady was a megalomaniac,” he said finally. “She should have been psychologically tested.”His assessment of her children, however, was quite different. “They believed their mother,” he said, “because she was their mother.”Everything I had learned in India was fragmentary, neighbourhood gossip unbottled after 40 years.To YorkshireI returned to London with three real leads. The airmail letter from Yorkshire. That name, Shahid. The Western Union receipts, testament that someone had been caring for Cyrus and his family in secret all these years. I took a train to Bradford, and walked to the address on the envelope. It was a gray, windblown day, and the walk took me past pawnshops, cheap Chinese takeout joints and dinky row houses of yellow brick, nearly all of them occupied by immigrants from India and Pakistan.I arrived, finally, at a small, neat brick house that was surrounded by a large collection of ceramic garden gnomes, teddy bears, Yorkies, mermaids and fairies. I was so nervous that I paced in front of the house for a while before ringing the bell. The door swung open, and before me stood a man in tiger-print pyjamas.He was barrel-chested and broad-shouldered, and looked to be in his mid-80s. He did not look well: His eyes were rheumy, his chest sunken. But he had Cyrus’s face, the same jutting cheekbones and hawk nose.He led me inside, showed me to a chair and then lay down on a cot. His movements were laborious. He glanced without expression at the photographs I had brought with me. When I offered to play him a recording of Cyrus’s voice, he shook his head in refusal, saying it would be too painful.Beside his sickbed were two framed pictures of Wilayat. This was Shahid. He was Cyrus’s older brother. And now, finally, there were some facts.They were, or had been, an ordinary family. Their father had been the registrar of Lucknow University, Inayatullah Butt. My friend’s name was not Prince Cyrus, or Prince Ali Raza, or Prince anything. He was plain old Mickey Butt. Here, in this brick house in West Yorkshire, I had found it: The identity that Cyrus and his family had worked so hard to keep secret.Shahid, who spent his adult life working in an iron foundry, could remember a life before Oudh, when they had housemaids and school uniforms. When their mother was not a rebel queen, but a housewife.Before long, Shahid’s wife, Camellia, came home. She was a friendly, plain-spoken Lancashire woman, animated on the subject of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn (whom she despised), and her husband (whom she adored.) The two of them met in 1968, when she wore her hair in a blond beehive and Shahid was built like a heavyweight boxer in those days, she said, dreamily, he could fight four men at once.She never met her husband’s mother, but had corresponded with her for years. She thought the story about Oudh was, as she put it, “a bloody big act”. “What was wrong with this woman?” she said of Wilayat. “I believed every word of it at the beginning, but now I doubt all of it. It’s very hard to get Shahid to talk about it. I think it’s painful. I think he was led to believe it was true. Then, as he got older, he realised it was all built on sand.”Shahid ran away when he was about 14, then emigrated to Britain and rarely mentioned his mother’s claim to the royal house of Oudh. When I asked him about that story, he was evasive. He said he wasn’t even sure whether he was Indian or Pakistani.“I’m so confused, I don’t know who I am,” he said. “I am like a bird, a long lost bird, a lost lamb.”I kept asking questions but Shahid was preoccupied by the news of Cyrus’s death – he called him Mickey – and that no one knew exactly where he was buried.“I should have saved him,” he said.Now, all of a sudden, the field of witnesses had expanded. There were other relatives, respectable people, scattered across Pakistan, Britain and the United States. Cyrus’s oldest brother, Salahuddin Zahid Butt, was a pilot in the Pakistani air force, a war hero who bombed Indian positions in the 1965 war. He died in 2017, but his wife, Salma, lived in Texas.I called her. She said her mother-in-law’s claim to royal descent was false. “She thought she was the princess of Oudh, but this was never, ever,” she said of Wilayat. “We never heard this history about the princess of this, the princess of that. She obviously had some mental disorder.”LahoreTwo of Cyrus’s older cousins, Wahida and Khalida, were still in Lahore, so I flew to Pakistan to see them. I parked beside an open sewer full of black, seething water, and walked down a trash-choked alleyway and knocked on a wooden door. It opened into a spacious compound, eerily quiet and green, with rosebushes in bloom.The cousins were hunched, birdlike women in their 70s. Wahida had worked for many years as a teacher, and barely spoke. She seemed to communicate by slapping people, hard, across the face. She wandered from one of us to the other, looking for someone to slap. Once, it was me. Mostly it was my interpreter, whose face hardened into a permanent wince. Khalida did most of the talking.She remembered Wilayat as a tempestuous young woman, but said they hadn’t seen her since the late 1960s, when she suddenly left Pakistan and returned to India. They seemed unwilling to say anything further. After listening to them discuss other subjects for an hour, I pressed the issue, conscious of the passage of time.“Ask her, did you ever hear that your family was related to the royal nawabs of Oudh?” I relayed to my interpreter. “I have no idea,” Khalida answered.“Wilayat said she was the queen of Oudh,” I told them. “She told the Indian government that for many, many years.”I prodded them for hours, until I was tired and frustrated.“Wilayat is dead,” I said. “Her children are dead. There is no secret anymore.”“Everything is a lie,” Khalida said. “They are dead. Just leave them. God forgives them, so we should also forgive them.”Trying to get Shahid to speak about his mother and siblings was painful. He would get stuck at a particular moment in the story, when his mother sent him out to buy bananas and he fled the family. Camellia said that, to this day, he would not eat bananas. She thought it was guilt. Besides, he was becoming sicker and sicker.It wasn’t a chest infection, but lung cancer that had metastasised to his lymph nodes. Camellia would not think of allowing him to be admitted to the hospital, but nursed him in the front room until there was nothing to do but give him painkillers.On my fourth visit to Bradford, the last time I saw him, his voice was raspy, but he told me more than he ever had before. The story, as he told it, began at Partition.On June 3rd, 1947, the British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, announced that the withdrawal of British Empire would create two independent nations, with Pakistan carved out for Muslims. Lucknow’s educated Muslims began slipping away overnight, headed for Pakistan’s new capital, where they would make up the DNA of a new elite. There were letters promising juicy promotions. And there were, on the other hand, rumours of violence if they stayed.Shahid’s parents had to make an immediate decision between India or Pakistan. His mother, Wilayat Butt, had never been so happy as she was in Lucknow. She was fiery and strong. Shahid has an image of her, striding out onto her balcony in Lucknow in jodhpurs and riding boots, slapping her thigh with a crop. She simply refused to leave.But then came one afternoon in the crumbling elegance of the nawab’s city. Shahid’s father – a man in distinguished middle age, wearing wire-rimmed glasses – was riding his bicycle home when he was surrounded by Hindu youths, who began beating him with hockey sticks.Bathed in bloodHe soon decided to move the whole family to Pakistan, where, in the great reshuffling, he had been offered a job overseeing the new country’s civil aviation agency. He was right to worry over the months that followed, the city of his youth, Lahore, would be bathed in blood.“We were children,” recalled Salma, Wilayat’s daughter-in-law. “Riots were on, and we couldn’t go out at all. Weeks and weeks, the dead bodies were lying around, and when we went to the bazaar to get our food there was so much rioting and robbing, people were robbing. At night it would be very frightening, you could hear people crying and shooting and stabbing. We would be sitting next to the window and watching.”Wilayat followed her husband, Shahid told me, but she never accepted his decision to leave India. She was obsessed with what she had left behind. In her mind, the grudge sprouted and germinated, and her behaviour became volatile. Then her husband suddenly died. Now with all restraining influence on her gone, furious over the expropriation of her property, she accosted Pakistan’s prime minister at a public appearance, Shahid said, and slapped him.This changed things for Wilayat. She was no longer a well-connected widow, but something shadier. She was confined to a mental hospital in Lahore for six months after that – the only way, Shahid said, to avoid a long prison sentence. Shahid remembers visiting her there, among the wails and curses of the patients.“It was horrible,” he said. “Women tied up with chains. One poor girl was chained up to a wall. It was four chains. And she was swinging. And spitting at everybody who went past.”Salma said that Wilayat was given electroshock therapy. “They said she was mental,” she said. “They gave her all these injections.”When she was free, Wilayat gathered up her youngest children without warning, packed trunks with carpets and jewellery, and smuggled it all back into India, with the goal of reclaiming her property. Shahid set out with them but eventually walked away. He could not put into words why he left. His story flickers out here.Early this month, Shahid died in the front room of his house, holding Camellia’s hand. It was Partition that ruined his mother, set her on the course toward the ruined palace, Shahid had told me.“We had to start all over again,” he said.In the early 1970s, still empty-handed, increasingly bizarre in her behaviour, Wilayat announced to the world that she was the queen of Oudh, demanding the vast properties of a kingdom that no longer existed. An ordinary grievance, unaddressed, had metastasised to become an epic one.They took on new identities: Farhad became Princess Sakina, occasionally Princess Alexandrina Mickey became Prince Ali Raza, and later called himself Prince Cyrus. They no longer made any mention of their Pakistani relatives, or the spacious family house in Lahore that was waiting for them should they return. Maybe they forgot it existed. They seemed to shed their past entirely, to come from nowhere.The rest of the story you already know. They were so convincing, and so insistent, that for 40 years people believed them. So there it is: I have plundered their secret.Cyrus would have hated it. He refused to answer questions about his past it was one of the essential themes of our friendship. I try to imagine how he would react to all this. His father on his bicycle, being beaten with hockey sticks. His mother in a mental hospital where women were chained to the wall. His older brother running away, abandoning him. Mickey Butt, the name he had left behind.There is no nice way to put this. I am unravelling the story that was the central work of their lives. It is impossible to know, now that he and his sister are dead, whether they even knew it wasn’t all true. Either way, this article would have crushed him. And yet, why do you invite a journalist into your life, if you do not expect this to happen? That is like asking a dog not to bark.I must admit, it offends me a little when people think they can lie to reporters. But even today there are plenty of autorickshaw drivers in Old Delhi who will tell you about the prince who lived in the jungle. And they will be telling that story long after mine has come and gone.I was reminded of this on my last trip to Delhi. I visited the cemetery where Cyrus is buried. I had an idea of placing a stone there, something that said Prince Cyrus of Oudh. But he had been buried as an unclaimed body, assigned the number DD33B. Unclaimed bodies are marked only with chips of stone, and small mounds extend in all directions, to the vanishing point. After wandering the cemetery for what seemed like hours, I sat down, sweaty and miserable.“He is lost in a city of the dead,” I wrote in my notebook.The strangerMy colleague Suhasini was haranguing the clerk, urging him to look through his ledger one more time, when I realised that a man was warming himself beside a stove, listening intently. He then stood up and presented himself, rather formally.He was Mohammad Aslam Chowdhury, a seller of electrical wiring from Old Delhi. He was wearing a voluminous, cheap-looking tweed jacket, and had a squiff of hair, dyed jet black. He presented a plastic folder and showed me its contents. It was filled with newspaper clippings about Cyrus’s death.He said he carried the clippings to remind himself how swiftly earthly glory passes. “In Old Delhi, this was the only topic of conversation,” he said. “People were saying such a big king passed away like this, in such a way that nobody knew him. How could the scion of such an illustrious royal family get lost in the darkness of oblivion?”As he spoke of Cyrus’s death, Chowdhury became distressed. “I feel really emotional about this, that something like this can happen on an Earth made by God,” he cried out, as the other people in the clerk’s office turned to stare. “O destiny, tell me why you are angry with me. What I have done wrong?”I glanced incredulously at my interpreter: Could this really be happening? But Chowdhury was in his own world. The story of the royals of Oudh had sounded a note within him. He would be telling the story for years, I realised.“If a person like this has gone into oblivion, and had this death of anonymity,” he said, wonderingly, “what can you say about the death of a commoner?” – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4098299.1574959225!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit fatigue unites voters in one of uk s tightest constituencies","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Michael Gilick: ‘If Brexit goes ahead, it will just ide people even more.

But I can’t stand Corbyn.’ Photograph: Jennifer O’ConnellA Dutch television crew is setting up in the market square in Newcastle-under-Lyme, one of the UK’s most marginal constituencies, in the heart of the electorally volatile West Midlands. But they’re not here to make a programme about the upcoming election. “What’s happening with the election?” one of them asks.They’re making a TV show about darts, he explains, because darts player Phil Taylor owns a pub here. The show involves asking people to throw darts at a dart board to see if they can hit the bullseye, which seems as a good an analogy as any for the final two weeks of campaigning in a general election.There can’t be too many others in this borough of 130,000 who are unaware there’s an election happening – even if there does occasionally seem to be some confusion about what they’re being asked to vote on.“Same as I voted last time. I’ll still vote Leave,” says Paul Lomas, who has popped out on his lunch break for some fish and chips.Efforts by Labour to move the conversation here beyond Brexit are not proving entirely successful, admits the party’s candidate in the constituency, Carl Greatbatch, who is on the other side of the square, making a video of his own for social media. “Sixty-three per cent voted for Brexit here, so it is an issue on the doorstep. But fortunately, it’s not just about that. There’s a lot of talk about NHS cuts, local government cuts, police cuts.”On Brexit, he says, “people have had enough of it. But even if Boris gets in and gets this vote through, that’s not the end of anything. It’s the start of everything.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s neutral stance on the issue “is the only honest way forward. It’s not a culture war, despite how people are driving it as that,” he says, adding that the way forward lies in uniting people, “and having a conversation about what does Leave look like, and what does Remain look like”.Despite his outward optimism, Greatbatch will be more aware than most that Labour needs to attract every spare vote in this constituency. The party has won here by a diminishing majority at each of the last six general elections. In 2017, his predecessor, Paul Farrelly, clung on to his seat of 18 years by just 30 votes. Farrelly, an ardent Remainer, has decided not to run again, making this seat a key target for the Conservatives, in a region – the West Midlands – often seen as a crucial stop on the road to Downing Street.In H Cheadle and Son butcher shop, Neil Goode and Mark Anderson bring up the 2017 votes controversy, but they suggest it might have been the Labour MP Farrelly who benefitted. “Waste of Time Farrelly”, they call him, enraged over his opposition to Brexit. “I haven’t always voted Conservative, but I will now,” says Goode. So will Anderson. “Everybody is so fed up, they just want it all sorted. Even some of the Remains now are fed up of it.”Their customer Michael Cooper is voting Conservative for the first time in his life. “I’ve always been a Labour man. I’ve always been a union man. But I can’t stand Corbyn. I won’t vote ever Corbyn.”Back on the high street, Labour voter Michael Giliker is frustrated by how this has become the “Brexit election”.“It’s the one thing which has politicised most people in the country. It’s good that everyone has a view,” he says, but he is unhappy that “the core issues we should be fighting for” have been overtaken by Brexit. He would like someone to come up with a “Go Compare” chart for political parties, so people could choose wisely, “just like you do your insurance”.He is worried about the future beyond the election. “If Brexit goes ahead, it will just ide people even more. And that frightens me.”However, she’s taking a novel approach to deciding how to cast her vote in this ultra-marginal constituency. “Are you sure you want this on tape? I’m into the energies, and I go with how I feel on the day. I go down the village. I go into the booth. I get my pen, and I look, and I wait.”The energies might already be offering a few hints, it seems. “I think we needed something to change the energy of what’s going on, and I think Boris might be strong enough to do that.”Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

We want to help change this.“We are launching Bó to help people build the habits and routines that will allow them do money better day-by-day and week-after-week so they can fund their lives and lifestyles in a more sustainable way.“As we’re part of NatWest, people can rely on Bó to keep their money safe.While app-only banks have grown their user numbers rapidly, they have yet to become profitable.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMany of the features will sound familiar to people who have already used one of Bó’s competitors.\u0026nbspUsers can analyse all of their spending by retailer, category and location, put\u0026nbspmoney aside in a “piggy bank”\u0026nbspand set goals.Curiously, however, the app is not yet linked up to the Bacs payment system so it will not allow customers to set up direct debits or have their salary paid into their Bó account.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cyclists make their way up a tree lined hill near to Moor Crichel in Dorset.

The Independent visits the northeast town where the Brexit Party holds the local council and is now targeting for electoral successIn 2002, long before the US elected a reality TV star as its president, or Ukraine a comedian, or Italy had a government coalition partly led by a comic, there was Hartlepool.The northeast town foreshadowed global populism when, more than a decade earlier, it voted for a monkey as its directly elected mayor. Or, at least, a man in a monkey suit.H’Angus – the local football club’s mascot – won office by offering every school child a free banana.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThen four years later, he won a second term – with an increased majority. And then a third. Only\u0026nbspin 2013, when the position of elected mayor was scrapped, did he lose power.Seventeen years on, some might argue that Moore himself is another symbol of that same disillusionment: he is the leader of the country’s only local authority run by the Brexit Party.Created with Sketch.General election: On the campaign trail Show all 94Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon plays with local children during a visit to the Jelly Tots \u0026amp Cookies Play Cafe in Uddingston, South LanarkshireJeremy Corbyn holds up unreacted documents with NHS staff.

order.Nigel Farage’s outfit have made this seat their unofficial prime target in the upcoming general election.Their thinking is that the Tories cannot win here – it has not been blue since the Fifties – but, in a town that voted 69.6 per cent in favour of leaving the EU, they, the Brexit Party, can.They have parachuted their biggest name – Nige excluded – into the contest. Richard Tice, party chair\u0026nbspand property tycoon, is attempting to wrest the constituency from the grasp of\u0026nbspLabour incumbent Mike Hill.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rumour is that the millionaire launched his bid here, did a bit of door-knocking and then hot-footed it back down\u0026nbspsouth to leave local footsoldiers doing the graft.Can’t be true.\u0026nbspCan it? On three separate days, I request to meet Tice in Hartlepool. I’ll join him campaigning any time that’s convenient, I say. And on three separate days the reply comes back that, sorry, he’s not available but he is definitely – definitely, definitely, definitely – in town.So: make your minds up.Either way, whether Hartlepool is actually as keen on the Brexit Party as it is on Brexit remains open to question.Neither Moore or his nine fellow BP councillors were actually elected under the party ticket. All were voted in as independents and then shifted, en masse, in September.More pertinently, perhaps, people here appear surprisingly sceptical of Farage himself. A common – though not universal – view emerges that he and Tice are using the town for their own political ends.“I wouldn’t trust them as far as I could throw them,” says Christine Morris. “And that’s not far, because I’m on the sick.”We are talking over cigarettes on the steps of the town’s 19th century Grand Hotel. I’ve come to the venue’s bar because this is where Farage officially launched the party’s election strategy of fielding candidates only in Labour-held seats.“He came, had a quick walk round, then off he went,” spits Morris, 48, herself an ardent Leaver.“I heard he had a pint in the King John’s,” notes Mark Herbert, 31.“I heard he didn’t drink it all,” comes a reply from another smoker listening in.There is momentary silence as this revelation – true or not – is contemplated. “No good,” concludes Herbert after a second.Hartlepool, it should be said, has much going for it.Living here means you are a seagull’s leap from some of the north’s most beautiful coast and within commuting distance of both Newcastle and York. In the town itself, the marina has been transformed into a hub of bars and restaurants, while town landmarks include the prestigious Northern School of Art and the BIS creative industries hub, recently opened in the restored general post office.But it is also a town where a civic map entitled “Places Of Interest” includes the local Asda.The past 50 years have not been kind. The town’s shipyards closed in the Sixties recession decimated its steel industry in the Seventies and Margaret Thatcher finished off the nearby collieries in the Eighties. Austerity has been the latest disaster. Spending levels fell by a third between 2010-17, while the local hospital’s A\u0026ampE was shut down and the police force cut to such levels that, in 2018, it was revealed only 10 officers were on duty at any one time in the entire town.“It’s a mess and has been for years,” says Dorothy Scott. “And it doesn’t matter who we vote for, it doesn’t change.”She is running a Christmas stall in the Middleton Grange Shopping Centre (third biggest mall in the northeast, the signs proudly declare), where passers-by can buy a bauble in aid of the local Alice House Hospice.But the festive spirit is soon lost at mention of the election.Seventy-year-old Scott voted Brexit – “because I’m sick of Europe telling us what to do” – but is now unsure who to plump for at the polls.“I could never go Tory,” the retired sewing machinist notes. “My father would turn in his grave. So maybe the Brexit Party, but all they have is one policy.”She is a regular user of the NHS. “Which makes me think Labour,” she says. “I don’t know. I’ll decide at some point.”Across the road at the Hartlepool College of Further Education – a 3,500-student behemoth in the heart of town – ambassadors Leah Cornforth and Chloe Harper are similarly undecided.“I’d like to become a prison officer,” says 20-year-old Chloe, who is studying a foundation degree in public services. “So, maybe the Conservatives because I think they’re saying they’ll increase numbers. But there’s that thing, isn’t there? Do you really want to be a Tory voter?”Leah, 20, nods. She’s the same but with Brexit. “I want it done but I don’t want Boris Johnson,” she says. “I’ll probably just end up going Labour.”Hartlepudlians, it seems, are contemplating the Brexit Party and, in some cases, the Tories – those I speak to decidedly do not want a second European referendum – but, as often as not, they come back to the same conclusion: they will, they say, probably just end up going Labour.This clearly isn’t what Tory candidate Stefan Houghton – a party worker and councillor in nearby Stockton – wants to hear.\u0026nbsp“Those tribal voting patterns are changing,” he insists. “Labour keeps letting Hartlepool down.”But it is also probably not the kind of response Mike Hill wants either.Sitting in his office in the town’s South Road, the Labour candidate appears dejected when I relay what I’ve been hearing on the streets. “We have to go out,” he says, “and make the positive case for voting for us.”He himself does this case today by zipping through various policies: greater funding for social care, free broadband, protection of the NHS, and a vast widening of green industry.“This region can lead the world in green power just like it helped lead the world with the industrial revolution,” the 56-year-old, who was first elected MP here in 2017, says.The former union official, who moved to Hartlepool 20 years ago, reckons Jeremy Corbyn’s position on a second EU referendum – offering one but staying neutral – has resonated with voters.“People understand the position now,” he says. “I can tell them Labour will get a deal to leave and then, if I am MP, I will be able to campaign to approve it.”How is Corbyn going down on the doorstep, I ask? “People mention him,” says Hill. “More than they did in 2017.”In a positive way? “Well...” he thinks for a moment. “They mention him. In different contexts.”If the leader is a difficult subject, so too is the one that comes next.Hill, himself, is currently being investigated by both parliamentary authorities and police over accusations – strenuously denied – of sexual harassment. Having temporarily withdrawn the whip, Labour is now standing by him.\u0026nbspBut I wonder, given the allegations remain live, was it right to stand?Yes, it was, he says. No, he will not comment further. “All I’ll say is if that’s all the Brexit Party has to throw at me, they’re struggling,” he adds.As I begin to leave, I am reminded of H’Angus the Monkey mayor.Hill is drinking from a cup with a cartoon ape on it. In Hartlepool, you’re never far from such an image. Simians hang in art galleries and are displayed on locally-made T-shirts. On the marina, there is a stone monkey on a plinth.How come? Because legend has it that townsfolk captured and hanged a monkey during the Napoleonic Wars. The story goes that, having never seen a Frenchman, they assumed the animal – stowed on a shipwrecked boat – was a French spy.Hence, the name H’Angus.That the town has embraced such a legend is typical of its self-deprecating sense of humour.Except no one here really thinks people were laughing when they voted in that monkey mayor 17 years ago. Rather, it was – like Trump and Zelensky and Grillo perhaps – a collective, if unwitting, cry for change an attempt to rupture a political system that was no longer working for people.The problem is, it still isn’t working. The same disquiet and disenfranchisement remain simmering away here. Issues around unemployment, housing and crime remain as unaddressed now as they were back then. A wise government, whatever form that takes, should perhaps take heed:\u0026nbspif the current political system cannot provide solutions soon, voters may start looking for them elsewhere.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet the Home Office insists they obtain “proof” from the foreign government that they have refused to issue them a document.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn other cases, foreign embassies refuse to issue any written proof to people who have been refused requests for passports\u0026nbspwhile, in some instances, the person’s country of origin simply does not have an embassy in the UK, making it impossible to appeal to them for a travel document.Lawyers said the issue was widespread and described it as a “ridiculously unfair” practice by the Home Office, which is placing vulnerable people at the mercy of the governments they fled from while preventing them from seeing their loved ones and attending family emergencies.Home Office immigration delays double as thousands ‘left in limbo’Home Office asylum detentions ruled unlawful as appeal dismissed‘Exorbitant’ citizenship fee ‘blocking children from legal right’One man, Hashar Murad, 34, who has been in the UK for 15 years – after fleeing political persecution in Iran – has had his request for a travel document repeatedly refused by the Home Office, which has prevented him from visiting his last surviving relative.The Iranian national was refused asylum in 2006, but was later granted\u0026nbspleave to remain on the grounds of his marriage to a British wife, Lynsey Murad, with whom he now lives with their four-year-old daughter in Irvine, Scotland – where he works in a car wash.On first applying for the document, Mr Murad was informed by the Home Office that he must provide proof that the Iranian embassy would not grant him a passport. Although he was afraid to do so, he approached the embassy and said they told him they could not help him but neither would they issue him an official refusal letter as\u0026nbspthis was not their policy.The Home Office has therefore denied his five requests for a travel document, leaving him unable to visit his younger sister, who is suffering with second degree burns after being recently caught up in a gas explosion.“I didn’t have the chance to see my father before he died, and I didn’t get to see my mother either. Now I’m worried I won’t see my sister. She is the only one left from my family. She is crying saying her brother doesn’t want to see her. That’s killing me,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“I don’t understand why the Home Office is doing this to me. I’ve never done anything wrong in this country. No crimes or anything like that. This is too difficult for someone who’s been in this country for 15 years.“I’ve been thinking about burning myself outside the Iranian embassy or outside the Home Office. I don’t want this life. It’s making me crazy.”Mr Hashar said he was shocked that the Home Office had repeatedly told him to go to the Iranian embassy, when the reason he had fled his country was to escape the government there.“The reason I left my country is because I thought I would be safe. But the Home Office wants me to go to the enemies and beg them. As soon as I open my mouth, they know I’m Kurdish. They tell me to leave they can’t do anything for me. I’m scared when I go there. I left my country because of them,” he said.“I came here for safety. They haven’t put me in a jail: I’m free, I can walk around, I can work, but inside it’s like they’re killing me, playing with my mind. Where are the human rights?”In another case, a Somali woman who has lived in the UK legally for more than three years\u0026nbsphas not been able to see her parents and siblings – currently asylum claimants in Sweden\u0026nbsp– because there is no Somali embassy in the UK.Her lawyer, Marcela Navarrete, partner at Wilson’s Socilitors, said the woman would\u0026nbsphave to wait another three years before she is eligible to apply for British citizenship and obtain a British passport.Human rights lawyer Shoaib Khan said he and other lawyers saw such cases “all the time”, often with people who had been in the UK for many years and their home country is unable to verify their identity, or because the inidual is afraid to approach their embassy.He said the Home Office had “remarkably restrictive” situations on which they issue travel documents, without realising that all embassies operate differently and there can be a multitude of genuine reasons, beyond the inidual’s control, why the embassy would refuse to issue the passport.“This means they are unable to travel abroad, even where there may be serious family emergencies. People have lost the chance to see dying parents or missed close family members’ funerals due to this,” he said.“The Home Office should be looking to assist such people, rather than unnecessarily exploring the embassy’s decision and deciding its reasonableness. Such Home Office attitudes leave often vulnerable people further isolated, as they are unable to visit family and maintain relationships.”Mr Khan pointed out that a refusal of an application for a travel document does not attract a right of appeal, meaning refusals were very rarely challenged, forcing people to instead reapply, pay\u0026nbspthe fee again once they have further evidence – or just give up.\u0026nbsp“They end up stranded in the UK, already not having seen their families for decades sometimes. Others fear approaching their embassies, for various reasons, but can’t obtain travel documents from the Home Office either,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Yet others, as here, have evidence but the Home Office just refuses to accept it. Just another facet of the culture of disbelief at the Home Office.Asylum seekers left destitute due to ‘failing’ Home Office contractHome Office to pay £25,000 in damages for unlawful deportation attemptHundreds left destitute due to legally flawed Home Office refusals“Such applications usually cost hundreds of pounds, but the Home Office won’t even make one phone call or send one email to the embassy to ask if the letter is genuinely issued by them.”Syed Naqvi, head of immigration at ITN Solicitors, said the Home Office’s approach to travel documents was “heartless beyond belief”, placing vulnerable migrants “at the mercy of some of the most barbaric regimes in the world”.\u0026nbsp“Many of these people have endured torture and horrific human rights abuses and are terrified of going anywhere near their authorities,” he said.\u0026nbsp“You only have to look at the dreadful consequences in the Jamal Khashoggi case to see that such fears are justified and the dire consequences such needless red-tapism can often have.”Ms\u0026nbspNavarrete\u0026nbspsaid: “There are lots of people here as parents of British children, or spouses of British nationals – there are loads of other bases that you can be here legally in the UK that is not a failed asylum claim.“It’s one of the things that seems ridiculously unfair. The Home office has a discretion that they could exercise, and they’re not really doing that. There’s no good reason for it.”A Home Office spokesperson said the department did\u0026nbspnot routinely comment on inidual cases and that all applications were considered on their inidual merits, on the basis of the evidence available and in line with the relevant policies.Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Everything is going to be nationalised, for a start. People will be able to work much shorter hours. But they’ll all, somehow, be paid more.Only the rich will face tax increases. The rest will get free childcare, higher wages, and there will be elves to tidy up and help out around the home for all working-class people.Or at least I think that’s what it said.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and leader Jeremy Corbyn have been busy explaining how everything they propose is totally reasonable and won’t really cost that much.And the more sincere they look, the more you should count your spoons.Because Labour’s spending plans are of the kind you might find in a book of fairy stories. Written by McDonnell and Corbyn — the Brothers Grimm. And the Brothers Grimm have said every single one of their proposals can be costed and accounted for — a downright lie, frankly.Here are the facts. For every additional £ the Conservatives intend to spend, Labour intend to spend not double that amount, not five times that amount, not even ten times that amount. They will spend  times that amount!That is a frankly ludicrous increase in spending and cannot possibly be paid for. On top of that, they are going to pay out a staggering £billion in compensation to women born between  and .These are the Waspi women who were badly treated when the pensionable age for women was raised. But where’s this money going to come from Jeremy Corbyn told an incredulous Andrew Neil, during Tuesday night’s interview, it would come from “reserves”.Neil pointed out that we don’t have any reserves. “Oh,” said Corbyn, looking a bit glum.

How can the BBC not understand that – unless it is just, as ever, desperate to stick the boot into the Tories CITIES in the North of England have lower le expectancies than some in Poland, Romania and even Turkey.That’s the main finding from a new report by the think tank IPPR North.Once Brexit is sorted out, this is the most important item on the Government’s agenda: Reducing the terrible inequality between rich and poor, North and South.It’s not Brexit that ided the country. It’s the gap between the haves and have-nots. Ayesegul Gurbuz, was a councillor in Luton until April .Your job is to try to guess what party she represented.She is on record as having described Adolf Hitler as the greatest man in the history of the world.

Between gasps for air, though, he managed to hand the paper over with a single instruction.“Read that.” I did.It was a review written by Clive James, The Observer’s legendary television critic, who died this week, at the age of .The year, I now discover from a collection of his work called The Crystal Bucket, was  and it must have been slim pickings for him that Sunday.There was no Eurovision Song Contest or Miss World or even an episode of The Incredible Hulk for him to dismantle. Instead he was setting the scene on a men’s downhill skiing race, at Kitzbuhel, covered by BBC’s Grandstand.“A man referred to as ‘Britain’s sole representative’ came plummeting down the Stre. ‘He won’t be looking for a first place today’, said David Vine, ‘he’ll be looking for experience’.“At that very instant — not a bit later, but while David was actually saying it — Britain’s sole representative was upside down and travelling into the crowd at mph. Spectators were mown down asby grapeshot.The air was full of snow, beanies, mittens, bits of wood. You had to be watching to get the full impact. It was kind of perfection.”The writing, it’s fair to say, hit me with the same force.My tiny, ten-year-old mind was officially blown. I’d no idea newspapers could be funny, until that moment. They were places behind which grown-up men went to hide and frown and tutt, not to be reduced to helpless, weeping wrecks.Nor did I have any idea watching the television could be a job. Paid  To watch Grandstand It was beyond anyone’s comprehension then and, slightly weirdly, after  years in the job, it’s still almost beyond my comprehension now.All of that is thanks to Clive James reinventing the role of television reviewer which, up until his arrival in , was a stuffy, reverential task performed by men, at the flat-lining end of their careers, who were still slightly in awe of the magic box in the corner of the living room.Clive James was none of those things. An Australian, he was an ambitious outsider and populist who had the honesty to point out that TV might well be a miracle of technology and incredibly popular but it wasn’t half rubbish as well.That’s the easy bit, of course. What set James apart from every other writer in Fleet Street was the poetic style and wit he did it with every single week.Since his death, from cancer, the obituaries have rightly flagged up all the one-liners which have set the industry standard ever since.He famously referred to Arnold Schwarzenegger as, “A brown condom full of walnuts”, and said of F commentator Murray Walker: “Even in moments of tranquility, Walker sounds like a man whose trousers are on fire.”The incredibly galling thing for anyone who’s trained as a journalist, though, was that James was an instinctively brilliant hack without ever wasting a day on his local newspaper.Here he is, luring me in, with another poetic intro from December .“Never since Damocles danced beneath the sword has there been anything like the World Disco Dancing Championships , brought to you live from the ravishing Empire Ballroom, Leicester Square.”Not for Clive James the high falutin’ marginal stuff, on BBC, you see, though he could do that as well. Unfashionable as it was at the time, he reviewed the television people actually watched.It meant Sundays became an event, across the nation, and our house was a minor warzone as my sister and me plotted and fought to become the first person to read his latest reviews.Those happy battles couldn’t last, though. The medium that bewitched Clive James eventually seduced him and, in , at the peak of his writing power, he became ITV’s Clive James On Television.Evenyou’re too young to remember this show, then you still most certainly live with the consequences of a programme where James held up for ridicule bad singing, from Margarita Pracatan, and a Japanese game show called Endurance, where contestants would be subjected to physical and mental torture with rats, lizards and water.At the time we thought it was some weird World War Two hangover the Japanese were working out of their system.We know now Clive James was in fact inventing the future of British television and I’m A Celebrity.The irony of this, and the debt I owe him, is not lost on me.Pick up any national newspaper today and you’ll find half a dozen journalists who owe their style, as well as the roof over their head and the food on the table, to the genius of Clive James.As you’ll quickly discoveryou read The Crystal Bucket and his November ,  review for another British TV staple, I just happen to be the most brazen tribute act.“The Royal Variety Show was hosted by Max Bygraves, who tried the time-honoured gimmick of singing the finale at the start.‘Andyou don’t like our finish, you doan have to stay for the show.’Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How it must raise morale among his troops!”And what a relief to the country it will be to read this prediction of a spanking for Jeremy Corbyn and his hate-filled boot boys.Christmas has come early, you may be tempted to think.If the poll also means putting a cork in that gobby Sturgeon creature — the one who wants to prop up Corbyn in exchange for billions of pounds and another Scottish independence referendum — well, great.And as a bonus it might also restore some reality to that delusional Miss Prim, Jo “I’m Going To Be Prime Minister” Swinson. What a delicious thoughtshe takes a custard pie in the eye. I know, I know, it’s tempting.But I’m afraid I am utterly serious. This poll was the last thing Boris needed at the moment. It was deeply unhelpful and may well land us with the hung Parliament that would paralyse our country and wreck Brexit.There is, as Mr Johnson’s backroom svengali Dominic Cummings pointed out this week, a terrible danger of complacency. That works on at least two levels.First, predictions of a solid Tory win could make vital swing voters think: “Actually, Boris will win without my vote, so I’ll stick to my old, tired loyalties because habits die hard and it will stop my leftie in-laws giving me a hard time.”Second, the YouGov poll could make Conservative candidates and their campaigners feel they need not try so hard. Bad, bad idea. Voters soon spota party is becoming cocky and they don’t like it. One hint of self-satisfaction can be fatal.The moment things are said to have turned badly for Neil Kinnock in the  election was when he swaggered on stage at a Sheffield rally in the last week of the campaign and started saying: “All right, all right.”Labour were ahead in the polls at that point and it looked asKinnock thought he had already won. A couple of days later, the boastful booby lost.The ancient Greeks had a word for that sort of excessive pride: Hubris. Boris Johnson is a classicist, so let’s hope he bears it in mind. The Tories may be running a campaign based on positive vibes and blue-fringed sunshine but this is really no time for optimism.Polling day — the real poll, the one that counts — is still a fortnight away. Most voters will not mark their X on ballots until two weeks today.There is still an awfully long way to go. In opera, it ain’t over ’til the fat lady sings. Diane Abbott becomes Home Secretary, she could well reclassy any references to portly sopranos as hate speech.In politics, it ain’t over ’til the election-night programme has ended.The Conservatives could still drop an almighty blooper. One misjudged phrase from Jacob Rees-Mogg, Michael Gove or Dominic Raab could still sink the canoe.Modern politics moves incredibly fast. Just look at how Jeremy Corbyn was given a comprehensive debagging this week by TV inquisitor Andrew Neil.Corbyn entered that interview studio all full of himself. Thirty minutes later he was, in a political sense, stripped down to his skimpies and string vest, knees a-knocking. More than  years in Parliament, he had been undone in just  minutes. Or so it looks at present.That’s the other thing. Opinion polls are a snapshot of public voting intentions at a particular time in a particular week.Just because they are collated by London wonks with pink-framed spectacles and designer haircuts and baffling bar charts, that does not mean they are right.In fact, there’s a good case for saying that the more “clever” political analysts are, the more likely they are to be wrong.I have spoken to numerous Tory campaigners in the past few weeks and none of them thinks Boris is romping to victory. Time and again, you hear: “It’s tight. We could yet lose this.”Look at the opinion polls in the last days before the EU referendum, which suggested Remain would win.Look at the poll which predicted a Yes win less than a month before the Scots independence referendum in .That galvanised the No campaign and made voters think: “Yikes, there’s a chance the other side could win.”Voters do not always tell pollsters the truth. The sheer nastiness of Corbyn’s cronies, with all those anti-Semitism claims, could be making the public reluctant to admit its support for Labour.Two years ago, “everyone said” Labour hadn’t a hope of preventing a Conservative majority. “Everyone said” is a deadly presumption. Labour did indeed stop Theresa May from winning that election cleanly, and look at the mess it caused.This time round, cocooned and comforted by those opinion polls, “everyone says” Boris has it in the bag. Well, he hasn’t.The only way to stop Corbyn is to vote against him.

He’s also in prison in Germany.

The girl, , had been physically and emotionally abused by her stepdad for months after his marriage to her mum broke up. But, like Bethany’s older tormentor on TV, the abuser brainwashed her into believing it was acceptable. Slowly, almost episode by episode, the teenager realised what was happening. And she knew – just as actress Lucy Fallon’s character Bethany did – she had to stand up for herself, she had to speak out. Now, after seeing her abuser jailed, the girl says: “Watching the show I started piecing it all together. At first I thought it was normal because he was my stepdad. “I was a similar age to Bethany in the show and it helped me create a picture of what was happening and what could happenI didn’t say something. “I need to tell my story so others are aware, they can relate to it or give someone going through it the courage to speak.” Her stepdad, who cannot be named to protect her anonymity, was jailed last month for more than two years after being convicted of sexual activity with a child family member. He will be on the sex offenders register for  years. The abuse took place two years ago – at the time of the Corrie plot. Actress Lucy, , was humbled to learn her role convinced the girl to go to the police. Lucy, who has played Bethany for five years, said: “It’s overwhelming to hear this young girl has been able to come forward.” The girl’s ordeal ended after she confronted her stepdad in July . She confided in a friend, who rang the girl’s home. Her mum was horried and called her daughter – as she was being driven home by the stepdad. The girl was hysterical and her mother told her to keep the phone on “speaker” mode so that she could hear everything. The mum takes up the story, saying: “When he arrived he was in tears saying, ‘Sorry, I canapost help it’. I told him I never wanted him near the kids again.”  The mum recalls watching Corrie oblivious to the nightmare her girl was going through. She adds: “We’d watch it and I had no idea it was happening to her. It gave her the courage to confront him and to speak out. I’d been married to him for  years, I was devastated. “Now I hope we never see him again. I’d no idea he was like that. He was playing mental games with her, messaging her, buying her things, groping her. She’s been amazing in reporting him.” The victim, now  and trying to rebuild her le, says her misery began during weekend visits to her stepdad. She says: “It started with him walking in when I was in the bath or as I was getting dressed. He said it was a mistake and it was brushed under the carpet. “I then got constant calls and messages. He started to put his hand on my inner thigh and kissing my neck and shoulders. I told him to stop but he still continued.” The girl’s mum had a breakdown after the marriage split and her ex – much older than her – used this as ammunition. The girl says: “He saidI spoke out I’d be the reason for Mum to have another breakdown. So I kept quiet.” And the abuse went on. The girl says: “He’d buy revealing clothes and repeatedly ask for photos of me wearing them. He also used to buy me alcohol. “I asked, ‘What are your feelings towards me ’ He replied, ‘I love you, but not in a daughter way’. Then he said, ‘It’s okay because most -year-old girls have the mindsets of -year-olds and age doesn’t matter’.”  The girl says that after confronting him he said something along the lines of: “Where do we go from here ” She says that has stuck with her – “and every time I hear those words in my head it makes me feel sick”. The girl gave evidence via video link and went to court to see him jailed last month. Her mum says: “She needed to do that. He had been found guilty and she had been vindicated. “It was a great relief for her that people knew she was telling the truth. It has been hard but she has been so brave.” The girl, due to start counselling in the New Year, adds: “I faced him at sentencing. It’s impossible to explain the emotions I felt. “Although it may seem like it’s over I have suffered mentally and physically. I don’t trust a single soul, I have panic attacks. “My mum has to force me to go to the shops with her. I started to knot my hair and pull it out which is a form of self harm. I did it without knowing. “But now I have the closure I need to move on.” TV star Lucy said: “The storyline was incredibly important to me and it was crucial we got it right and told it with accuracy and care.

The -year-old man’s ordeal ­started weeks after he ended a three-month fling with Cha Roberts. The mum-of-three, also , texted him to say she was pregnant and needed £ for an abortion. Her ex, who had just started a new relationship, said: “There was no ­reason not to believe her. “At that time I’d never have ­imagined a woman could be capable of lying about something like that.” A month later she told him she hadn’t gone through with the termination and needed money for a pram, cot and baby clothes.He started to pay out amounts between £ and £ almost weekly from his £, of savings. He said: “She kept telling me thatI didn’t pay up she would go to my girlfriend’s work and tell her I had made her pregnant. Then she said she would go to my parents. “She found out where my partner’s mum worked and said she would turn up there. I felt trapped. I was in a new relationship and thought I’d lose my girlfriendI told her. “Cha was sending me about  messages a day full of threats. “She was asking for money every few days for dferent things and I didn’t want to shirk what I thought was my responsibility. “One night I just lost it and told her I had no money left. She told me she’d tell police I’d raped her. We both knew it wasn’t true but she said the police had to take her seriously.” Roberts then set up  fake Facebook ­identities, both male and female, and messaged his girlfriend.  “They were really odd. Some called my girlfriend pretty and ­others called her ugly. We believe she also posed as a bloke who asked my partner for a date.” Seven months after starting the scam, Roberts, from Hull, told him she had ­prematurely given birth to a baby boy she called Jax and that he was seriously ill with heart problems. He said: “She wanted money almost every day to travel to the hospital. I askedI could see my son but she said he was too sick. When I asked for pictures she would just say no. “It was then I started to become suspicious but I still thought, ‘Surely she wouldn’t make up something like that ’ I was in too deep.”  When he insisted on seeing Jax, Roberts said the baby had die. He gave her £ for the funeral. “The day my baby was supposed to be buried was one of the worst,” he said. “I had to sit at home thinking the child I had never seen was being laid to rest.” The victim’s girlfriend, a teacher, eventually saw her WhatsApp messages and persuaded him to go to police.

It was a rare trip to London this week for Steve Green, , and his we Jean,  – and they lapped up every minute of it. For once the hard-working couple, who rarely leave their North Yorkshire farm, could swap their daily chores for the delights of the capital. As guests of the Sunday People they had tea at the Ritz and went to see Buck House. The couple found fame when on Channel ’s The Yorkshire Vet and in March renewed their wedding vows on the show. And we published their story. The self-sufficient pair were excited about their big day out as they approached the Ritz, near Piccadilly Circus. When Jean spotted a ft Christmas tree in the lobby she joked: “Hell, look at all those lights, Steve. It’s fantastic. It’s like Piccadilly Circus.” Jean was wearing only a thin gilet over a fun T-shirt with a “give peas a chance” logo but said: “This isn’t cold.” It was a dferent world from their farm in Thirsk  miles away where there are no mod cons and Steve still works  hour a days from am.

It has been home for  years to Steve, who found love with Jean in his s. Their daughter Sarah, , lives with them. The couple chop their own logs for fuel, grow all their food and look after calves, donkeys, one dog and  cats.  They have never used the internet and before this year the ­farthest they had ­travelled was  miles to Whitby for their honeymoon four decades ago. But the Greens’ TV appearance made them ­overnight celebrities. And next week fans will see their very first trip to London, in May, to visit The Donkey Sanctuary Garden at The Cha Flower Show with Yorkshire Vet star Peter Wright and his we Lin. But this week’s visit was all about relaxing, and the Greens tucked into finger ­sandwiches, cakes, tea and scones with cream at the Ritz. When asked which has been his ­favourite decade Steve immediately replied.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailKatie Nelson was  when her sister was murdered and  years later the scars run deep. Bodybuilder Paul Dyson strangled her beloved -year-old sibling Joanne and dumped her body in a ditch. Afterwards he pretended she had disappeared and sobbed fake tears on TV as police launched a massive search. Dyson’s charade fooled Katie at first – and she comforted him when he came round to her home and wept. The beast was eventually turned in by his mother and ordered to serve at least  years in jail. But his victim’s family are appalled to learn that Dyson, now , is being moved to an open prison and recommended for day release after just  years inside. Katie, now , said: “It was a whirlwind of emotions which brought back every single bit of pain. “We didn’t know what to say to each other or how to comfort each other. “The pain is always there, it never goes away, but you learn to suppress it. “This brought it all back again. We thought this was a ridiculously lenient sentence for what he did before the murder, during and afterwards. “All the hiding and lying that inflicted so much stress and pain on myself and my family. “It wasn’t an accident, it wasn’t a moment of rage, it was an awful, calculated crime he committed. “He’s now got the chance to potentially start a new le at his age, which makes us feel sick.” The family are terried of bumping into Dyson when he’s allowed out – having received no assurances he will be banned from ing to Hull, East Yorkshire, where they live.  Katie said: “We don’t want him to come back to here, but we haven’t been toldthere’s an exclusion zone. “We want to make sure no one in our family puts themselves in any kind of danger. You don’t want to bump into the man who killed your family member.” Joanne grew up in Hull with her two younger sisters, Katie and Janie, and parents Jean and Charlie. “She was the best big sister you could ask for,” said Katie, who still lives in the city. “She was easy to talk to, friendly and considerate. “There were so many happy, loving family memories that I have from our childhood.” Joanne worked at the Job Centre and loved helping people to improve their lives. “She was an extremely trustworthy person which I think was maybe part of her downfall,” Katie added.  Joanne met Dyson when she was  and he was a nightclub bouncer nine years older than her. They moved in together and got engaged. But the steroid-popping kick boxer was a bully with a vicious temper who was nicknamed “Psycho” by pals. He also had dark secrets, which were never revealed to Joanne’s family until the trial. Dyson attacked a previous we on their wedding night, beat her frequently and once throttled her until she was unconscious.  He boasted he could get away with murder and idolised his late father who had killed twice. His dad Peter had stabbed a man he suspected of having an affair with his we and left a father of seven dead in a hit-and-run crash. “I don’t believe Joanne knew any of this,” said Katie. “I don’t think she could have accepted that in a partner that she wanted to marry and have children with. “We heard he would always talk about how he could get away with murder and how his dad had killed two people. “This was just another massive blow to the man that we were willing to accept into our family, to look after Joanne for the rest of her le.”  On Valentine’s Day in , Dyson throttled slightly-built Joanne with his bare hands at the house they shared in Hotham Road North, Hull. He went berserk after she criticised him for being so lazy around the house that he was unable to use the washing machine. Afterwards he calmly drove to his mother’s to borrow a garden fork, even stopping to talk to a neighbour about a cat he and Joanne were planning to buy. Dyson wrapped her body in bin bags and covered it with tree branches in woods  miles away in Bransby, North Yorkshire.  That night he called police and said his fiancée had gone missing. Dyson claimed he had left her in bed before going to work and ed home to find she had vanished. A search was launched involving hundreds of police, soldiers and volunteers. Her father immediately suspected Dyson but Katie could not believe it. “It was something I strongly protested between our family, I just could not accept this,” she said. “I couldn’t believe that anyone who knew Joanne could ever hurt her.” Before Dyson was arrested, he even came around to the family home where Katie comforted him. “He sat there, and he cried and I cuddled him,” she remembered.  Dyson went for a walk, and Katie went to look for him, worried that neighbours might think he was a murderer. “I found him at a bus stop, and held his hand,” a heartbroken Katie said. “At the time I didn’t register it, but he had scratch marks on his hand. “It kills me to think about how they were probably Joanne’s defence marks. The ridiculous charade he put on is unforgivable.” These were the marks which police used to help prove that Dyson had killed his girlfriend.  Detective Superintendent Ray Higgins, who led the investigation, spotted the crescent-shaped scratches during his tearful TV interview. They were made when Joanne tried to fight him off. Dyson’s mother turned him in after he confessed to a friend. He admitted the killing to police but said he could not remember where he put the body. Joanne’s remains were eventually found six weeks after her disappearance. At Hull crown court in November  Dyson, then , was jailed for a minimum  years before being ­eligible for parole. Sentencing him, Judge Tom Cracknell described the crime as an “unspeakable evil deed”.  But Dyson could be back on the streets in less than two years from now and Katie wants to warn women to stay away from him by publicising the case. The primary school teacher explained: “I hope no women fall for the story that he can be rehabilitated, he can’t. It’s so easy to just blend back into society. But I want his face out there, I want people to know what he did. “I don’t want Joanne to be forgotten. Any women that he meets will be in danger, people need to know this.” Katie said that having a child herself has put a dferent perspective of Joanne’s death.  “At the time I wasn’t a mum, but now I am I cannot begin to imagine how my parents have gotten to this point,” she said. “Losing my sister the way I lost her was absolutely horrendous. And the thought that that could ever happen to my child is just heart wrenching. “I still struggle to understand Joanne’s death, because I don’t understand how she could ever bring on such an act of violence from someone. “Knowing what kind of person she was, and knowing what kind of adult and mum she could have been is just heartbreaking. It’s devastating that she didn’t have the chance to give more to the world.” "},{"url":null,"title":"instagram influencer 9 10000 followers","story":"NewsInstagram influencer, , has , followers and brands beg to work with herNuala Childs is regularly showered with gts from brands to promote on her Instagram page and in September she was invited to walk the catwalk at London Fashion Week for luxury brands Lulu et Gigi Couture and Marie Belle CoutureShareCommentsByBrendan McFaddenSophie McCoid:,  NOV NewsNuala Childs successful career started just under a year ago when she launched her fashion blog By Nuala \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Hugging the adorable pug-terrier cross, Paul is still visibly moved when he recalls her harrowing story. Last year Florence was run over and nearly killed. She was found slumped in the road, covered in cuts, and unable to walk with broken pelvis and a dislocated hip. Her eye was also damaged. She was taken from Enfield, North London, to Battersea Dogs  Cats Home, where she had surgery and months of care from specialists and volunteers. TV host Paul, , formed a close bond with the pup and said: “I will never ­understand how people can be so cruel to a defenceless dog. “She had been hit by a car not once, but twice, and left for dead. “She was so badly injured but she was still so loving and affectionate – it just broke my heart.” Thanks to dedicated medical care, the sweet-natured dog made an excellent recovery and found a happy new home with a family in Middlesex. Her new owner Neil Rosewell said: “Despite everything Florence has been through, she is the most loving and ­affectionate dog we’ve ever known. “Everywhere we go, we’re stopped by people wanting to stroke and talk to her.” Emaciated For the Love of Dogs presenter Paul, an ambassador for the charity for seven years, said the dedicated team at Battersea had nursed Florence back to health. He said: “They found her a loving home and gave her a second chance at le.” Battersea aims never to turn away a dog or cat in need and that’s why today, Paul wants all Sunday People readers to support our new Christmas fund-raiser.  We’ve teamed up with Battersea to launch our Help A Dog Christmas appeal, in association with their own In From The Cold campaign. Each gives Battersea the funds it needs to ensure all the dogs they take in are cared for this Christmas and beyond. Last winter , pets were left out in the cold. But thanks to kind-hearted people like you, the staff at Battersea were able to bring them in to the warmth, give le- saving care as well as the love and ­attention they deserve until they are found a new home. Paul said: “It breaks my heart to see these animals coming in near death. “But look at how the ­charity breathes le back into them. “The dogs that come in can be in a shocking condition – stab wounds, cigarette burns. And so skinny ­because they haven’t ­eaten, just emaciated. “The staff work miracles. They get the dog back to health then a really nice person comes along to re-home them. “I’ve been ­involved with Battersea since . It’s a brilliant charity but they really do need funds. There are so many dogs in there now. They provide an excellent service. Without them, I don’t know where we’d be with stray dogs, abused dogs, puppy farmed dogs. Saddest “The money goes to looking after them. It goes towards the bedding and all the kennels, the dog baskets. All the small things like toys and balls. Plus the vet clinic they have at Battersea and all the medical costs. “Battersea needs funds to nurse them back to health and find them the loving homes they deserve.”  One such dog is Sparkle, a Staffordshire bull terrier found starved and emaciated in a suitcase by a dog walker and taken to Battersea. Ali Taylor, Battersea’s head of canine behaviour and training, who has worked at the charity for  years, said: “I’ll never forget when she came in, it was like she’d already died. There was just no emotion, nothing there. It was the saddest thing. What made it more upsetting was that Sparkle was so loving and trusting in people. But there was a positive – Sparkle did make it.” She gained weight and got back to full strength. One of the vet team fostered her until she was re-homed with a couple in Essex. Founded in , Battersea is one of the UK’s oldest rescue centres and has rescued, reunited and re-homed more than three million dogs and cats.  Last year, it helped more than , dogs and this Christmas it will be home to more than . But its level of care is not cheap. Each day it costs the charity £, to care for all the animals across its three ­centres. With no government funding, it goes through  tins of dog food a day and performs  operations a week. Its  volunteers and  staff don’t just work with dogs who come in ­injured. They take in any dog, often when the owner’s circumstances have changed, such as loss of accommodation or ­perhaps allergies. Ali said: “Sometimes people don’t know what they’re taking on and they can’t really commit. “So the dogs come to us and we find them loving new homes.”  Battersea rescues and re-homes dogs all over the country, from Newcastle, to Leeds, Wales and even Scotland. Ali said: “We work with a lot of other rescues centres, taking in dogs they don’t have room for and helping with training – as far afield as Sheffield, Doncaster and Carlisle. “We do a lot of campaign and education work. “A lot of our work is outreach. “We take in dogs from ­anywhere in the country and I have re-homed dogs as far afield as Scotland and Wales. We’re a national charity and help dogs from every corner of the UK.” Paul knows how amazing rescue dogs are. He has four of his own, including puppy Arfur, who came from Battersea.  Paul said: “Rescue dogs are so loving, it’s almost asthey’re grateful. “They bond with you in seconds – they’re just wonderful.” He said: “I’ve got so much respect for the volunteers, the staff – everyone who works at Battersea. They’ll all be in there on Christmas Day, doing their tireless work.

Usman Khan, , was one of nine fundamentalists who schemed to target sites including the Houses of Parliament, the London Stock Exchange and the US embassy. He was recorded saying that the only possible outcomes for him were martyrdom, prison or victory. The terrorists were also recorded discussing leaving bombs in pubs and clubs in and around Stoke-on-Trent, where Khan lived at the time. He was named by police as the suspect who was shot dead following yesterdayaposs deadly attack, and searches of his Staffordshire home are being carried out. A man and a woman died, while three others - a man and two women - were injured in the attack. It has since emerged that Khan, who was born and raised in the UK, and eight others were jailed for a iety of terror offences in February  - and he was freed in December last year. Khan was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection - meaning he could remain in jail beyond the end of his eight year sentence. Have you been affected by the London Bridge terror attack  Email webnews@mirrorHowever the Court of Appeal overturned this, instead sentencing Khan to a -year term, with half being served behind bars. He was released from prison after agreeing to wear an electronic tag and be monitored by authorities, the Times reports. The newspaper said he was attending a Cambridge University conference on prisoner rehabilitation being held at Fishmongersapos Hall yesterday and threatened to blow up the building before embarking on his attack at London Bridge.  What Khan was recorded saying by police Yesterdayaposs deadly attack comes after Khan and two others admitted engaging in conduct for the preparation of terrorism between November  and December , . He had been secretly recorded talking about plans to recruit UK radicals to attend a training camp in Kashmir. He said there were only three possible outcomes for him and his fellow jihadists - victory, martyrdom or prison. Khanaposs Stoke-on-Trent home was bugged, and he was heard discussing plans for a firearms training camp, which was to be disguised as a legitimate Islamic religious school. Discussing terrorist fundraising, he said Muslims in Britain could earn in a day what people in Kashmir - a disputed region ided between Pakistan and India - are paid in a month. He continued: On jobseekeraposs allowance we can earn that, never mind working for that. Khan said he could only see three results: Thereaposs victory, what we hope for, thereaposs shahada , or thereaposs prison. Four other cell members admitted an al Qaida-inspired plot to detonate a bomb at the London Stock Exchange. aposGroup was plotting very serious acts of terrorismapos Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said in February , when the nine were sentenced: These defendants had in overview decided that ultimately they would be responsible for very serious acts of terrorism. What was observed during the indictment period was planning for the immediate future, not involving suicide attacks, so that there would be a long-term future which would include further acts of terrorism. Khan and Nazam Hussain, , were given indeterminate sentences for public protection and to serve at least eight years behind bars, while Mohammed Shahjahan , was jailed for a minimum term of eight years and  months. Passing sentence, the judge, Mr Justice Wilkie, said this was a serious, long-term venture in terrorism that could also have resulted in atrocities in Britain.  He said: It was envisaged by them all that ultimately they and the other recruits mayto the UK as trained and experienced terrorists available to perform terrorist attacks in this country, on one possibility contemplated in the context of theof British troops from Afghanistan. Top judges cut Khanaposs sentence after appeal The trio appealed their sentences and on April ,  had their indeterminate sentences quashed by the Court of Appeal, which instead imposed determinate custodial sentences. Allowing their sentence appeals, Lord Justice Leveson, sitting with Mr Justice Mitting and Mr Justice Sweeney, ruled that Shahjahan now had to serve  years and eight months and Khan and Hussain  years.  Lord Leveson said at the time:  There is an argument for concluding that anyone convicted of such an offence should be incentivised to demonstrate that he can safely be released such a decision is then better left to the Parole Board for consideration proximate in time to the date when release becomes possible. The court of appealaposs judgement stated: The groups were clearly considering a range of possibilities including fundraising for the establishment of a military training madrassa in Pakistan, where they would undertake training themselves and recruit others to do likewise, sending letter bombs through the post, attacking public houses used by British racist groups, attacking a high profile target with an explosive device and a Mumbai-style attack. How was he able to carry out attack  politan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said:  The investigation into the attack near London Bridge continues at a pace. Whilst we are still in the early stages of the investigation, at this time we are not actively seeking anyone  in relation to the attack.  However, we continue to make fast time enquiries to ensure that no other people were involved in this attack and that there is no outstanding threat to the public. As I stated earlier, police were called at .pm to a stabbing at premises near to London Bridge, EC. Emergency services attended, including officers from the City of London Police and the politan Police. A male suspect was shot by specialist armed officers and I can confirm that he died at the scene. We are now in a position to confirm the identity of the suspect as -year-old Usman Khan, who had been residing in the Staffordshire area.

I think he got around  in his short time here.“His attitude was phenomenal. He was no big-time Charlie – a nicer guy you couldn’t meet.“Everyone at the club loved big Louis. He would come over from Fe on the bus two nights a week for training. Nothing was a problem for him. He would pick up the cones or lend a hand with the kit.“On a match day, any instructions our manager Jamie McCunnie gave him, he carried them out to a T.”Finlayson reckons Appere’s future in the game may not stop at Tannadice.“His attitude means football should hold no barriers for him. He’ll give everything he’s got.“He used us as a . It was a chance to get playing men’s football. He said he would give it his best shot.“It was a fantastic opportunity and he took it with both hands. He came to us as a boy and left the club as a man.”Although dferent types of players, Finlayson says there are similarities between Appere and Murray, a player he worked with at another local junior club, Violet.Finlayson continued: “John McGlashan brought Simon to Violet.“He was a great lad, a bit older, a bit mischievous and a bit more street-wise than Louis.“But when that whistle went he was totally focused. In that respect he was very similar to Louis.“When he came to the club we were struggling against relegation but his goals and performances lted us up the table.“He was working as a plumber at the time but his performances saw him move to Tayport, then quickly on to Arbroath and Dundee United.“He’s since played for Hibs and Dundee and now he’s down in South Africa turning out for Bidvest Wits.“He’s done very well for himself.”Finlayson admits junior football isn’t for everyone but he reckons it can be either the path into senior football or a learning curve for young pros.He went on: “Players must have the right attitude to play junior football.“There can sometimes be a wee bit of senior snobbery. Not every club will send players out to the juniors.“But the likes of Peterhead boss Jim McInally is always in touch to see what’s going on and who the better players are.“Playing in the juniors can sometimes tell you a lot more about a young lad than, say, turning out in games in the U  league for their senior teams.“I’m convinced many would benefit more from a season in junior football.“However, they must have the right mentality – Louis and Simon certainly had that.“Junior football should not be discredited – it’s character- building.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48693415-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48693415-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48693415-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48693415-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"calum butcher signs new deal at dundee united until 2023","story":"Calum Butcher has signed a new deal at Dundee United until .The combative midfielder has extended his stay at Tannadice after an impressive  months since re-joining the club last January.United currently sit top of the Championship and Butcher was delighted to get his future with the Tangerines sorted out.#I am delighted to sign the contract,” he said.“United is a great place to be right now.

Shaun Byrne was on the bench.The Dark Blues made much of the early running, dominating possession but struggling to find a way through a packed Doonhamers defence.Attacks from the visitors were few and far between but there was a warning of what was to come from Dobbie as he forced Hamilton into a save on  minutes.Thirteen minutes later he gave the goalkeeper no chance after nipping away from Jordan McGhee and Robertson before rattling a low effort into the corner from  yards to make it -.Dundee were still in control of possession but Queens continued to hit on the break and El Bakhtaoui had the chance to double their lead on  minutes as he sped through but hit straight at Hamilton.With Queens goalie Robby McCrorie untested, McPake threw on striker Danny Johnson to partner Kane Hemmings as Jamie Ness limped off before the break.After the break, a mix up between Sean Mackie and McGhee gave Connor Murray a free look at goal but the winger fired just wide before El Bakhtaoui stung the fingertips of Hamilton.Finally the Dark Blues gave McCrorie some work to do on  minutes and it looked like they#d found the equaliser through Hemmings# low shot but the goalie gathered at the third attempt.That didn#t spark le into the display, however, as Dundee continued to struggle to break the Doonhamers down.They finally did, however, after  minutes as Johnson found the top corner with a super strike.Seconds later that was undone as, straight from the kick-off, Dobbie pinched the ball off Forster to win the game for his side and see boos ring out at full-time from the home support.Dundee: Hamilton, Kerr, McGhee, Forster, Mackie, Ness , Robertson , Todd, McDaid, Dorrans, Hemmings.Unused subs: Ferrie, Byrne, McPake, Strachan, Cunningham.Queens: McCrorie, Mercer, Holt, Brownlie, Kilday, Pybus, Murray , Dobbie, Osman, Lyon, El Bakhtaoui.Unused subs: Leighfield, Gourlay, Irving, McCarthy, Kidd, Oliver.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/5dd655325c8a95.18678290-e1574336960138-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee boss mcpake knows side has quality but admits consistency lacking","story":"Boss James McPake accepts the pressure is on him and his staff to find a way to bring much-needed consistency to Dundee’s season.The Dens Park side are languishing  points off leaders Dundee United in fourth spot after consecutive defeats to the Tangerines and then Inverness at the weekend.After racking up plenty of points and plaudits in October, November hasn’t been so cheery but James is keen to finish the month off on a high this weekend at home to Queen of the South.To do that, however, Dundee will have to show much more attacking threat than they have in the past two games, according to their manager.He said: “The game at Inverness was really frustrating. I have watched it back a couple of times now and there was nothing in the game.“You get a lot of games like that in this league.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"harry potter halloween at pony club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHarry Potter was the theme for this year’s Hallowe’en Fun Day organised by Argyll South Pony Club at the Long Walk arena near Kilmartin.Even the judges # Ulla Riddell and Mary Lou Aitchison – got into the spirit of the day by dressing as Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

This was not a good decision.\"There hasnrsquot been a consultation and itrsquos very frustrating that the administration just keep going and they get put in the position of defending a decision to close playparks by saying theyrsquore not closing the play parks, they are removing the play equipment. This is madness.Following the announcement of the poundmillion investment in destination playparks earlier this year, members were told that  smaller playparks would be scrapped in Tweeddale.But SNP councillors Heather Anderson and Stuart Bell challenged the decision and insisted it go out to consultation.Councillor Anderson continued: ldquoThere was not an allowance for the maintenance of these new play parks so it was delegated to officers to make sure it was a cost neutral programme and they were to come back with recommendations after consultation.\"Now no consultation occurred, there was no report on the consultation because there hadnrsquot been any. And there was going to be a reference group, but they never met.Two petitions with  signatures against the playpark closures have been received by the audit and scrutiny committee of Scottish Borders Council.Councillor Anderson added: ldquoThese petitions were from people in Hawick and Kelso who were frankly furious at the suggestion of closing playparks in their areas.\"The main argument they made that the recommended playparks for closure were quite close to houses and suitable for younger children, so that whole thing of allowing smaller children to play independently, they would be discriminated against.ldquoThere was a lot of questioning of officers and it became clear that we hadnrsquot been given any information about the costs of maintaining the parks that had been recommended for closure.\"We hadnrsquot been given any information about how much it would cost to maintain the grass after they decommissioned the park. And, we hadnrsquot been given alternatives about some of the parks being upgraded whilst others were closed.ldquoWhere we are now, the decision is in abeyance. Hopefully when we get back after the election we will be able to say can we actually have a genuine consultation about these playparks with some real numbers about what it would cost.\"The future of the small playparks is to come before a full meeting of Scottish Borders Council for consideration.Chairman Les Turnbull said: ldquoIrsquom glad to hear what yoursquore saying about it being in abeyance because my impression of the correspondence that I had from Councillor Aitchison was that lsquowe hear what yoursquore saying but we arenrsquot listening wersquore ploughing onrsquo.ldquoWe

Itrsquos also a contact point for the council.ldquoThere is also a worry that people arenrsquot going to pop into nearby shops and to use them, itrsquos taking something away from the town centre.ldquoThere is also a big worry in Jedburgh about buildings going out of use. It is situated in a historic building that was purposefully built for the people of Jedburgh as a centre for information.Currently, the council is planning to close the old library, which was first opened in May , when the new intergenerational campus at Hatrigge Park opens in April .The library was built by the Scottish-American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, who attended the opening ceremony in the town, after an earlier library he had built six years earlier on the high street had proved to be inadequate.Six years ago, Scottish Borders Council voted to integrate its contact centres into the regionrsquos libraries, and since then the council has maintained an outpost in Jedburgh Library, which will also move to the Jedburgh Grammar Campus in April.At the audit and scrutiny meeting, the service director for customers and communities, Jenni Craig, explained that the library will have much longer opening hours at the new campus: ldquoIn relation to accessibility, and the times that the library is open, one of the benefits of moving to the new campus will be the library will be longer.ldquoWe accept that this is a huge change but we also see this as an opportunity.ldquoMembers will be aware that as part of the councilrsquos lsquofit for rsquo transformation programme we are considering how we can deliver services dferently to make the best use of our facilities.ldquoWe have a very challenging financial outlook and we have a five year placen for transforming our services.ldquoIn Jedburgh, the signicant investment in the campus gives us the opportunity to make the most of the facility.After hearing from both sides, councillor Heather Anderson, who represents Tweeddale West, proposed that the matter is formally referred to Ms Craig, and that the service director begins a consultation with the public to address their concerns, from January to March, before the new campus opens in April.The motion was seconded by Galashiels councillor Harry Scott, and the motion was passed, with only Jedburgh councillor Sandy Scott voting against.Speaking after the meeting, petitioner Georgiana Craster said: ldquoIrsquom happy. I was expecting a year long consultation, but you know you ask for bigger and you get lesser, so this is something that we can actually put to the residents.ldquoThere is a lot of sentimentality around the building, and we have to be practical. The school is a wonderful thing, no one is going to say anything against that, but we have to think about everybody, itrsquos not only about educating children itrsquos also about the future of

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph. On hearing this, I took a short journey to Clovenfords and was delighted to locate ldquothe white house just before the bend which is where the McVeys apparently resided.Like many such encounters, only a smattering of memories remain but a little stardust goes a long, long way."},{"url":null,"title":"jane-fiona-become-queens-nurses","story":"A#CARE home nurse and a learning disability nurse have both been awarded#the prestigious title of Queenrsquos Nurse.##Jane Douglas, Chief Executive at Queenrsquos House in Kelso, and Fiona Mason, a senior charge nurse within the Scottish Borders Learning Disability Service, were selected earlier this year to take part in a nine-month development programme run by the Queenrsquos Nursing Institute Scotland.##Both were nominated#by their employers for providing high quality, compassionate care to people in their communities.#After completing the programme successfully,#they were awarded the historic Queenrsquos Nurse title along with  other community nurses at a ceremony in Edinburgh on Thursday.###Jane has been with Queenrsquos House for around three years and was appointed Chief Executive in April.The charity, which employs approximately  staff, has two care homes - Queens House and Murray House.Jane said: ldquoI have worked in care home nursing for many years across a range of roles before I was lucky enough to get my current job.\"I love where I am now - I am where I am meant to be.ldquoMy aim is that people experience le in a care home positively, that they have a voice and they are able to be autonomous as much as they can be.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

Itrsquos getting busy these days, often with families, which is great to see. Even still there is enough space amidst the trees to quickly find solitudeyou need it.I can never visit this wonderful place without whispering a word of thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson for his role, along with others, in saving this precious and magical wood, which my family has almost literally grown up in.I have got to know Gregor, who still lives in East Lothian, and the world is made a better place by caring and thoughtful people like him.We arrived at the wood in late afternoon, knowing that we wouldnrsquot have a lot of time before nightfall. The ground was literally carpeted with orange and yellow, and autumn colours still hung on the trees.But there was a nip in the air a cold crisp reminder that summer is now long gone and the fingers of winter are about to grip us. So we kept on the move to keep warm.As we ventured deeper into the wood I noticed something. ldquoStop, I said to the kids, ldquoand listen.There was not a breath of wind, it was deathly still. The trees stood in absolute silence. I couldnrsquot even hear any traffic, or the usual distant murmurings of modern day le. There was no noise, only the sound of nature.Bird song was above us. I was surprised to hear such a chorus on a late autumn afternoon.We stood, listening. It was asthe birds were suddenly singing for us, and the children were genuinely enthralled, as was I.We decided to continue our walk, but our mood had now changed. The silence could have been eerie but it wasnrsquot, it heightened our awareness that the wood had le we couldnrsquot see.It was asour inner senses had been aroused. The kids wanted to walk silently, so they could continue to listen. So we practised ldquowalking like a Native American hunter as taught to us by Chris Yule, another East Lothian environmental luminary.We crept through the wood, looking for deer, and faeries, now acutely aware of any faint sound that the absence of noise made possible to hear.Finally we reached our favourite place, and sat, still listening. I have to tell you, seeing my two youngest being so quiet for so long was a unique experience.Then it began to get dark, and the bird song faded away.We headed back to the car as the trees turned into shadows. But we still stopped every now and then to listen and peer into the undergrowth. We were convinced at one point we could see a deer hiding from us.We got to the car as the last glimmering light in the sky vanished, and the moon came out from behind the clouds. It was a magical experience, not a scary one. Wersquod had an unexpected connection with nature, that wasnrsquot visual, but something deeper.I turned the engine on, breaking the silence, and we ed to our world of articial light and constant noise. But the whole walk had had a meditative effect on us, and I reflected on the fact that we are replacing sound with noise, and we are the poorer for that.We are so constantly surrounded by human made sounds that we donrsquot notice it. The noise has become the background to our lives. Few of us probably reflect that we need to connect to the sounds of nature anymore, or true silence itself.Our inner selves do however. Call it what you will, our soul, our spiritual self, our primeval awareness. The truth is we need the absence of noise every now and then so the sounds of nature can be heard. It replenishes us, reminds us who we really are, and lts our mental health. No matter how much we pave nature over with cement, we cannot avoid the fact we are part of it and need it.Yet, we are increasingly separated from it, including the sounds and the silence that comes with the absence of our noise. Is there a connection between this and the mental health crisis we now face The neon lights of a shopping centre, and the constant buzz and noise we fill our everyday lives with may seem like progress, but it isnrsquot for our well being. We need places where such noise is absent ndash where only nature is heard. No, actually, we need many more of these places, but sadly we are going in the reverse direction destroying the ones that survive."},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-family-return-italian-roots-open-food-lovers-paradise","story":"They have restored the home of their ancestors in Picinisco in Lazio, Italy, and turned it into a holiday destination complete with a boutique hotel, cookery school and winery.Members of the Di Ciacca family moved to Cockenzie  years ago and Cesido Di Ciacca took over The Cockenzie Cafe, a cafe, fish  chip shop and ice-cream shop, in .The family lived above the shop on  High Street and integrated themselves into the community.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent. The food van arrived and he packed the chocolate under his jacket.

In comparison, many rural practices with lower patient lists and practices in more deprived areas - where residents are less likely to visit a GP - got little or no extra money.In some cases the formula indicated that their funding should be reduced, but in these cases the Scottish Government allocated special payments to ensure they did not end up worse of that before.: Rural GPs in Scotland vote to reject new contractHowever, GPs in rural practices argued that the potential to earn substantially more in urban practices would exacerbate existing staff shortages in rural Scotland, and that the formula failed to account for the extra services rural GPs provide in areas where there is no nearby hospital.Ms Freeman said Phase  of the contract would address discrepancies in GP pay. Practices have been asked todata to the Scottish Government and BMA for the first time detailing their income, expenses and workforce, including practice running costs and how much GPs take out as salary.Dr Andrew Buist, chair of BMA Scotlandrsquos GP committee, said the information would be used to address iations in GP earnings and bring them into line with salaries of hospital consultants, without undermining GPsrsquo independent contractor status.He said: ldquoThe earnings of all GPs in Scotland should be comparable to that of hospital consultants for core clinical work.ldquoAnd like consultants, GPs should also be able to earn additionally from enhanced services, private work and other sources of income."},{"url":null,"title":"energy-boss-accuses-parties-losing-focus-climate","story":"ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said Labour promises to take back control of the Britainrsquos energy network meant ldquolosing focus on the issue of tackling the climate emergency.Mr Anderson was responding to comments made by Glasgow North East Labour candidate Paul Sweeney as part of a climate hustings organised by the firm with WWF and The Herald.The event, hosted by journalist Bernard Ponsonby at ScottishPowerrsquos headquarters in Glasgow, featured representatives from the five main Scottish parties taking questions from an audience of around  people.Mr Sweeney said  under a Labour government would involve further state intervention planning in the economy, describing it as one in which ldquothe absurdity of having to search around for dferent gas and electricity bills would be over and the ldquogas board and electric board ed.He added: ldquoIt is one intergrated system, letrsquos extend public ownership and democratic ownership across our economy.

For over a decade, The Herald has published the Scottish Language Dictionariesrsquo Scots Word of the Week and the new book gathers some of the best. The words demonstrate the breadth and ersity of the Scots language. And who knows, they must just get you through the election.BLELLUM noun an idle, ignorant, talkative manThat blellum is still used or known at all is largely due to Robert Burnsrsquo epic poem Tam orsquo Shanter penned in  where Tam is described as a lsquoblethering, blustering, drunken blellumrsquo. In so few words, we have a picture of a talkative, sometimes boastful, possibly diminutive, man.Its use in Scots is not confined to Burns. The Dictionary of the Scots Language reveals that the word also appears in John MacTaggartrsquos Gallovidian Encyclopedia of  where he defines it as lsquoan ignorant talkative fellow.rsquo From Lanark in , William Stewart in his Lilts and Larks frae Larkie describes a character in the terms: lsquoThus he raved, the senseless blellum.rsquo Although many recent usages do indeed refer to Tam, there are some instances which do not. Pete Fortune writing in the anthology A Tongue in Yer Heiddescribes a character thus: lsquoIn face auld Tosh helliprsquoThis seems to call into question the veracity of whatever Auld Tosh was about to say. Regarding the etymology, The Dictionary of the Scots Language suggests that it is perhaps a conflation of English lsquoblabbe, A gurgling noise with the lips in a liquid and skellum, A worthless fellow, scamp, scoundrel, rogue, now sometimes used playfully to a young boy. rsquoANNAKERrsquoS MIDDEN noun a mess, a shamblesThe Dictionary of the Scots Languagersquos earliest example of the above phrase used in this sense is from central Scotland in . This was firstly interpreted in the dictionary as lsquoa knackerrsquos midden. rsquoLater research suggested that it originated instead from: lsquoAnnackerrsquos, a Glasgow pork butcher from  to  their messy bins were frequently raked through by the poor.rsquo Michael Munro in his Patter, Another Blast, from  traces the origin to a firm of pork butchers, sausage makers and ham-curers: lsquoFounded in , at its height it was a chain of  branches all over the city.rsquo The company also owned a sausage factory, the last location of which was Napiershall Street .A quotation from Edinburgh in  shows that as it spread eastwards, the phrase had developed an extended meaning: lsquoTherersquos the Knackerrsquos midden at it again. Said of a person who is voracious. rsquoHowever, the original meaning of a scene of general chaos is still very much with us, as illustrated by an example from a guide to Scottish speech in the Daily Mail of September , : lsquoANNACKERrsquoS MIDDEN: A mess, a dreadful muddle. rsquoGreg Hemphill and Ford Kiernan writing in Still Game from  describe a house after a lsquoflittingrsquo as: lsquoLook at this. Itrsquos like Annickerrsquos Midden. rsquoWIDDERSHINS adverb in the wrong directionThis comes from Middle Low German weddersinnes or Middle Dutch wedersins. In the early quotations we have, it frequently refers to hair standing widdershins in response to some alarming experience lsquothat will gar all their hearts tremble and their haire start widdershinrsquo .In other contexts, there is no doubt what the wrong direction usually is. The Scotsmangives us a clue, pointing out an error made by a well-known weather presenter: lsquoHe at least should know that wind round anti-cyclones goes widdershins. rsquo Going counterclockwise or against the motion of the sun is not only wrong but inauspicious. Sir Walter Scott in the Fair Maid of Perthdescribes: lsquoA very ancient custom which consists in going three times round the body of a dead or living person, imploring blessing upon him. The Deasil must be performed sun-wayshellip If misfortune is imprecated, the party moves withershins. rsquoWe find a lot of evidence in accounts of witchcraft, such as this  quotation from A History of the Witches of Renfrewshire: lsquoUpon the pronouncing of some words, and turning himself about wider-shins, that is turning himself round from the right hand to the left, contrary to the natural course of the sun. rsquoThe New Statistical Accountrecords that Shetland fishermen, lsquowhen about to proceed to the fishing, think they would have bad luck,they were to row the boat ldquowithershins about. rsquo However, on a romantic note, the poet Allan Ransay declares : lsquoThe starns shall gang withershins ere I deceive thee. rsquoBOORACH noun a mound, an untidy heapThe SNPs Ian Blackford memorably called Brexit a clusterbourach but boorachrsquos etymology is in itself a right boorach. The Gaelic word buacuterachappears in The Dictionary of the Scots Language under the entry lsquobooragrsquo, defined as a piece of turf used as peat or for roofing, and illustrated by David Stephen in Gleanings in the Northwith this colourful quotation involving damage to daughter and dog: lsquoMaister Jolly, yin gigglegawkie, fat ye carsquo mrsquo son, dangs bowarag in my dochterrsquos ersquoe, and tramped rsquoporsquo my folpeyrsquos feetrsquo. Gaelic buacuterach comes from English burrow , from Old English beorg.The dictionary is less clear on the derivation of boorach. It may be from beorg, but it has been suggested that it may be related to Old English buror burg , which gives us burgh. Whatever the source, we find it as a mound or a heap of stones in Alexander Grayrsquos Arrows : lsquoHe has struck his fit on a bourock he trippit and slippit, and syne He fell. rsquoJames Brown in The Round Table Clubtells us: lsquotwenty deid deer waur coontit, arsquo lyinrsquo in a boorach thegither. rsquo John Black in Melodies and Memoriesdescribes seasonal cheer: lsquoOrsquo holly leaves wirsquo berries bricht, Anrsquo bouracks big orsquo cake anrsquo bun To grace the feasts anrsquo spice the fun. rsquoFrequently, boorachs are untidy, hence the use of the word to describe a teenagerrsquos bedroom or, more figuratively, avant-garde music: lsquoa new- fangled musicrsquos juist a bourockrsquo as TS Cairncross declares in the Scots Magazine .In Mairi Hedderwickrsquos Katie Morag Delivers the Mail , Grannie says: lsquoWell, this is a fine boorach yoursquove got yourself into, Katie Morag. rsquo I know it as a crowd, huddle or cluster, like ES Rae in the Banffshire Journal : lsquoAnrsquo boorichs black orsquo crawinrsquo clamrinrsquo craws. rsquoDICHT verb to wipe, clean, put in good orderNowadays, dicht is usually used in the sense of to wipe. The Aberdeen Makar, Sheena Blackhall, uses it frequently. In The Bonsai Grower , we read of mothers lsquodichtin bibbly snootsrsquo. In the DSL, it is still found in related senses such as to polish, clean or sweep. Edinburgh Burgh Recordsnote the requirement that lsquoeuery man and woman dicht and mak clene befor ther durris and closisrsquo. Stirlingrsquos defences were well cared for, because the Burgh Recordscontain an entry lsquoFor thrie sheep skins to dight the cannonrsquo.The parent Old English word dihtan had a wider range of meanings, several of which were shared by Scots and English until the word became obsolete in English in the th century.It often meant to dress or decorate. Robert Henryson in the late th century describes a magnicent lsquocroun of massie goldhellip Withhellip mony diueris dyamontis dicht. rsquo According to the lexicographer, John Jamieson : lsquoA discourse is said to be weil dicht, when the subject is well handled.rsquo Dicht could also mean to st or winnow grain and, in Angus, in the mid-th century, a strong wind could still be described as lsquoA wind at wid dicht berersquo.Food can also be dichtit, hence a hospitable proverb from David Fergussonrsquos collection : lsquoA friendrsquos dinner is soon dight.rsquo Another proverb drew upon the habit that hens have of wiping their beaks before going to roost.So, we get this political comment from James Ballantinersquos The Gaberlunziersquos Wallet : lsquoWharsquos to be prime minister say ye  Charlie Fox  Troth man, thatrsquos good news indeedhellip Troth anrsquo Billie Pitt may now ersquoen dight his neb and flee up.rsquo If you want to tell someone to take a look at themselves before criticising others, you might say lsquoDicht yer ain door stanersquo. Perhaps a lesson for our politicians ETTLE verb to intend, plan, aimThis word comes from Old Norse aeligtla and makes its first appearance in Scots around  in John Barbourrsquos Troy Book. On balance, ettlin in the DSL seems predominantly directed towards mischief but this bias could be because of splendid examples from court records. The Council Register of the Burgh of Aberdeen alone gives us: lsquoHehellip drew furth his dager, aitling to hawe strukin the said officier thairwithrsquoand, involving an unusual weapon, lsquoFor etling to strik the said Issobell with ane brasin panrsquo .The sense sometimes drts into lsquoaimrsquo as in A Rossrsquo late th century Fortunate Shepherd: lsquoA gentle squire of freely gentle cast, Of sweet address, anrsquo skillrsquod in courting art, That well coud ettle Cupidrsquos winning dartrsquo, hence J Kellyrsquos Proverbs : lsquoOft Etle, whiles hit. This he explains as ldquoPeople who have made many Tryals to do a Thing, may hit right at last.rsquoBurns uses it as a noun in Tam orsquo Shanter in which, lsquoNanniehellip flew at Tam wirsquo furious ettlersquo and this determined declaration comes from James Stewartrsquos Sketches o Scottish Character : lsquoAnrsquo I winna be put frae my ettle, Not ersquoen by auld Hornie himselrsquo.A similar determination lies behind this ambitious imperative from John Galtrsquos The Provost: lsquoYersquore ettling at the magistracyhellip and Irsquoll no let ye restye dinna makrsquo me a bailiersquos we or arsquo be done. rsquo A more modest and understandable desire is expressed in P Macgillivrayrsquos Bog-Myrtle and Peat Reek : lsquoAnrsquo aye we ettlersquot the ither dram, Wirsquo dry oatcakes for a foond.rsquoTo end on a thoughtful note, here is a sentiment from JL Waughrsquos Robbie Doo : lsquoHope! ay, itrsquos the ettler orsquo youth and the solace orsquo age: lose it, and the firstrsquos a failure and the last a burden. rsquoMINCE noun nonsense, rubbishApart from haggis, mince and tatties is one of Scotlandrsquos iconic national dishes which has nurtured many generations. Mince is so embedded in the national psyche that it has developed many unusual and inexplicable meanings. It features in insults such as: lsquoHe talks a lot o mincersquoorlsquoyer heidrsquos fu o mincersquo, yoursquore either very confused or a complete fool, as illustrated by this example from The Observer: lsquohellip tensions move the pace on to straight urban demotic, our respected Minister [David Blunkett] can expect to be told his heidrsquos full of mince, or called, most woundingly, a numpty. rsquoand, staying with politics, the Daily Record of April , , tells voters that lsquoOnly you can decide whorsquos talking mince. rsquoA stupid person or persons can be described as being as lsquothick as mincersquo, as Hardeep Singh Kohli writes: lsquoTodayrsquos Tories, for all their privilege and erudite education, are arguably the least able coterie of Conservatives we have ever had in power. Basically, they are thick as mince. rsquo Finally,someone is listless, idle or untidy, they are accused of being like a pound of mince: lsquohellip this frequenting of the Empress every afternoon and sitting about the house like a pound o mince isnae helping anybody. rsquoAnd an Edinburgh informant from  tells an untidy person: lsquoYer claes are hingin like a pun o mince. rsquoSCOOBY noun a clueRhyming slang is sometimes thought to be strictly the domain of the Cockney but it has been utilised as a device by Scots speakers too. Scooby Doo, the cartoon character created for the Hanna-Barbera Productions in , is an addition in the second edition of the Concise Scots Dictionary because, as far as we can ascertain, in the early s his name was used as the rhyming slang for lsquocluersquo.Although we cannot find any examples of his name in full, it seems always to be shortened to lsquoScoobyrsquo as in lsquoI havenrsquot got a scoobyrsquo.The earliest example that we have in our research records comes from The Herald of May , : lsquoYour lawyer telling youse that he husnae a scooby and youse can jist take a wee tirravie tae yersel.rsquo The fact that the term is used in print in a national newspaper illustrates that it was in common enough use to be understood by the general public but as with many new Scots words finding evidence in print is very dficult.Many of the current examples seem to be concerned with our national obsession with football as this example from Grant Stott writing in the Edinburgh Evening News of January , : lsquoIf I had a pound for every time someone has asked me or texted me the question, ldquoBig man, whatrsquos happening with yer team  Irsquod have hellip well, a few quid now. And the answer is always the same. I havenrsquot got a Scooby. rsquo There is as ever, as with much of research, a hunt on for earlier examples of this phrase.SPEEL verb to climb, clamberThe derivation of this word is obscure the earliest recorded meaning in the Dictionary of the Scots Language is: lsquoto perform as an acrobatrsquo and dates from . Later, it widens its meaning to include lsquoTo mount, ascend to a height by climbing to climb, clamberhelliprsquo The OED suggests that it may originally derive from lsquoolder Flemish or Low German spelerplayer, actor. rsquoAt Christmas and other times when party invitations are forthcoming, speel comes to mind as a candidate for The Heralds Word of the Week because of a reply in verse given by Robert Burns, writing in , to just such an invitation: lsquoSir, Yours this moment I unseal, And faith Irsquom gay and hearty! To tell the truth and shame the deil, I am as fou as Bartie: But Foorsday, sir, my promise leal, Expect me olsquo your partie, If on a beastie I can speel, Or hurl in a cartie. Yours, Robert Burns. Mauchline, Monday night,  orsquoclock.rsquoThe verse creates a clear mental picture of a slightly tipsy Burns trying to clamber onto his horse. Most other examples in the DSL are centred round scaling less mobile objects than horses. In , O Douglas in Farewell to Priorsford wrote: lsquoNaebody had ever tried to spiel thae rocks. rsquo Figurative uses are well documented too. The following is from RW Thomrsquos Jock o Knowe: lsquoTam Gripper, then nae laird atweel, Maun up the social ladder speel.rsquo SCUNNERED: How many of us will be feeling by the time this General Election campaign is over.

But perhaps even that would be a risk that Dominic Cummings and Tory advisers would be willing to take. After all, those who have agreed to an Andrew Neil interview in this election campaign have found it an unforgiving experience.First up was Nicola Sturgeon.The First Minister is an accomplished media performer ndash easily the most competent politician in front of a camera in Scotland, and surely in the top ten across the UK.Her interview wasnrsquot quite the car crash that social media would perhaps suggest, but it was certainly a deeply uncomfortable  minutes.Her wild assertions about how easily an independent Scotland could stroll into the EU were ruthlessly exposed, and she may come to regret describing the SNPrsquos currency tribulations as a lsquojourneyrsquo.The -second-long list of problems facing the NHS under the Nationalists also deserved the million-plus audience it has since received online. Yet at times the First Minister held her own and, realistically, her performance is unlikely to cost the SNP many votes.However, it might help some Labour left-wingers in England understand why their Scottish colleagues get so angry when they describe Ms Sturgeon as a comrade.Predictably, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, fared far worse in his own interview. Thoroughly displeased at being there, he repeatedly struggled to explain how he would pay for his manesto promises.Then, with voters screaming lsquojust apologisersquo at their TV sets, he refused four times to say sorry for the anti-semitism shaming his leadership.If heads were in their hands at Labour HQ, the verdict in Tory HQ will have been lsquowellhellip sod thatrsquo.The Andrew Neil interviews have given voters some food for thought, as these set-piece TV events should.The ITV head-to-head between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn has been the only major let-down so far, with a bizarre format which gave neither politician enough time to answer the questions. On this occasion, the victors were those not invited ndash Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon. With hindsight, perhaps they should have saved their parties from the huge legal bill of trying to get on the line-up.In contrast, the winners in Thursday nightrsquos climate change debate were those who did appear, with Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage reduced to ice sculptures for not showing up.When it comes to how much impact these debates have on the final election result, the jury is out ndash Cleggmania in  didnrsquot really translate to Commons seats.But Electoral Reform Society research has found that  per cent of people believe debates are important, and a third say theyre key to helping them decide how to vote.They want to see points put across clearly, factual evidence for claims, and a debate that engages the audience watching at home. And as well as being watched by millions, they certainly set the campaign narrative.In , Alistair Darling bested Alex Salmond in the first TV debate of the independence campaign. If you canrsquot remember it, Mr Salmond decided to ask questions about alien attacks, while Mr Darling pointed out that an eight-year-old could name their countryrsquos capital, flag and currency, but Mr Salmond couldnrsquot say what currency an independent Scotland would use.In the  election campaign, I was involved behind-the-scenes in the Scottish TV debates. The amount of preparation work was immense. Days of going over attack lines, defence lines, introductory remarks, key messages, second-guessing opponents, and the occasional bit of role-play.Spin doctors had their own role to play on the night as well. The first debate on the BBC involved a nurse telling Ms Sturgeon to her face that NHS staff were having to use foodbanks. While journalists in the spin room tried to file their copy, political advisers interrupted them, talking up their own employer to some extent, but mainly talking down the rest of the line-up.For the SNP, this backfired when the message was spread that the nursersquos husband was a Tory councillor. It categorically wasnrsquot true.However, the Nationalists had a better night of it at the STV debate. Unusually, the broadcaster decided not to provide inidual green rooms for the politicians, so they all had to share the same space for a long time before taking to the stage.Willie Rennie and Ruth Davidson dealt with this through humour, cracking jokes to demonstrate confidence. Kez Dugdale, who I was working for, focused on her notes. Nicola Sturgeon kept herself to herself. She had something up her sleeve.In the debate, she claimed that Kez once told her in a private conversation in the aftermath of Brexit that Labour might rethink its opposition to an independence referendum ndash something she strongly denied. But having run a campaign focused on opposition to independence, this was a lsquogotcharsquo moment. It was, comfortably, the toughest moment of the campaign.So I wish my successors at Scottish Labour, and at all parties, every good fortune for the coming days.This campaign still has nearly a fortnight to run. The Scottish TV debates have yet to be broadcast, there is another Prime Ministerial head-to-head to come, and it remains to be seenBoris Johnson will sit down with Andrew Neil.There are a lot of nervous politicians, and a lot of nervous spin doctors. They have a right to be nervous, because the voters deserve more honest answers."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire council wishes you a very mer recycling christmas","story":"Aberdeenshire Council is wishing North-east residents a very mer-recycling Christmas as the festive season fast approaches.This year the local authority is encouraging householders to ensure landfill is not on their Christmas wish list as arrangements for festive recycling and waste collections are unveiled.Households create more waste at this time of year as a result of buying excess food and presents, wrapping paper, cards and possibly even their Christmas tree. But residents can help save tax-payers’ money by making better use of available recycling services and avoiding sending items to landfill unnecessarily, as sending waste to landfill costs much more than recycling.Waste team manager Andrew Sheridan explains: “In terms of food waste, first and foremost we are encouraging residents to reuse their leftover turkey and vegetables in warming casseroles, tasty pies or even bespoke pizzas.“Failing that then you can recycle foodstuffs in your food caddies which are collected from homes every week.”And when it comes to the array of Christmas-related materials we accumulate, there are many types of cardboard, non-glittery Christmas cards and other items which can all be popped into your blue-lidded kerbside bins which are picked up fortnightly.Andrew explains: “Wrapping paper can only be recycledit passes the scrunch test - simple paper wrap can be recycled, but foil or glitter-decorated paper cannot and needs to go in the general waste. It’s astonishing just how much of this material can actually be turned into new products,instead of rotting away for years in landfill.“To help ensure householders make the most of their Christmas materials, a host of fun festive recycling tips will be published on the council’s social media channels, including ideas for presents that won’t cost the earth.”When it comes to real Christmas trees and larger items of cardboard packaging, these can be taken to Aberdeenshire’s recycling centres. But you should note that the council’s network of recycling centres will be closed from pm on Tuesday, December  until am on Friday, December  and from pm Tuesday, December  until am on Friday, January .

They also took the chance to have a question and answer session and have an Olympic athlete give them some coaching tips. Active Schools Lead Coordinator for Central Aberdeenshire, Malcolm Grant, said: “Across Scotland this month the sporting theme from sportscotland is Local Heroes and Eilish ticked every box during her visits to Oyne Primary and Inverurie Academy. “The focus on personal best resonates strongly across a broad range of school subjects, not just sport, but having Eilish presenting her thoughts on her own career and how she intends to continue to improve and progress, despite her already extensive achievements in athletics, ensured that all of the pupils went home with some extra inspiration and motivation to do the best that they can, whatever they choose to do in the future.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Neil McDonald, Scott Duguid and Peter Taylor at the eBlast celebration event\"  Kintore firm marks th anniversaryviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Lady Michelle Mone OBE attended the Inverurie Loco Works Football Club Business Lunch\"  Inverurie club marks decade of success viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmADVERTORIAL: The ideal gt from the Kirkwall BID area for any occasion.

With growing awareness of the huge threats facing wildle and habitats in the UK and across the world, it would be great to have more festival events which focus on the importance of looking after our environment and give people the opportunity to get involved on a local level to help save nature.#I would like to encourage anyone who has an idea for an event they would like to run to get in touch as soon as possible.”Any organisation or inidual who would like to take part in the  festival can contact Eleanor at the RSPB Orkney office in Stromness on  or email orkney@rspb.org.uk  For more information on the festival as it becomes available you can check out the website at: www.orkneynaturefestival.orgOr visit the festival#s Facebook page at: www.facebook OrkneyNatureFestivalcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

East Dunbartonshire town, Milgavnie, came in a close third on  per cent.The national competition for Scotland’s Most Beautul High Street is run by two of Scotland’s most well known organisations for place and the environment — Scotland’s Towns Partnership, the national body for towns in Scotland, and Keep Scotland Beautul, the environmental charity which campaigns to keep Scotland green, clean and sustainable. The online vote took place over a four-week period.Phil Prentice, chief officer of Scotland’s Towns Partnership, said: “This competition is all about recognising the work and effort of local people to make their high streets the best they can be. It’s not just an award for a high street, it’s an award for the people who occupy it.#I’ve seen first hand just some of the innovation and forward thinking used in Kirkwall and it is a real demonstration of what can be achieved with creativity and determination.“I want to warmly congratulate Kirkwall, and all of the worthy towns who were shortlisted. It’s no secret that our high streets have been under pressure for the past few years, but this competition gives us hope for the future.#When people come together and take ownership of their places, great things can happen and big challenges can be overcome.”Katie Murray, communities and place manager at Keep Scotland Beautul, commented: #I would like to offer my congratulations to Kirkwall for being selected as Scotland#s most beautul high street.#This is a fantastic example of how, by working in partnership, signicant improvements can be brought forward to improve the town centre experience for residents and visitors alike. #Every participant in the competition deserves recognition for the benefits that they are delivering across Scotland — helping everyone to enjoy cleaner, greener and more beautul communities.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The project was allowed to sell meat until October , and this extension takes advantage of the European Commission’s approval for Scotland-wide sales until any new potential EU exit date.These licences permit the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland directly to consumers as well as to retailers, such as hotels and butchers.Claudia Rowse, SNH’s head of natural resource management said #We are delighted to announce the continued sale of resident greylag goose meat. Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We know that striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, allowing them to control goose numbers sustainably and sell goose meat for profit.”SNH have said they are working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland. A project review will take place in January , in light of the UK’s EU exit arrangements, and take into account any changes arising from the current review of its General Licences.Sale of wild goose meat shot outside the project is prohibited under the Wildle and Countryside Act .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The former Traffic Commissioner for Scotland, who stepped down in February, also never minced her words in  years of regulating buses and lorries.Recalling her time in the hot seat at an event in Edinburgh this week, she said she had turned the “turgid”, paperwork-focused approach of the office into “dynamic engagement” with bus operators and haulage companies, driven by her overarching goal of keeping people safe on the roads.From the cases I have covered over the years, Ms Aitken had no compunction in banning miscreant operators or putting them out of business, and she let them know why in no uncertain terms.She told a Glasgow lorry driver she would not wait until he killed someone, and he could not be trusted behind the wheel because his greed for making more money came before safety.The owner of a South Lanarkshire childcare centre was told that Ms Aitken was “singularly unimpressed by her seeing herself as some sort of victim” - when she had failed to get a licence.Speaking to the Scottish Transport Studies Group think tank, Ms Aitken’s job sounded at times like being a sherf in the Wild West, imposing the law on bus wars, “baddies” and the “criminality” of some operators.However, while Ms Aitken said she had largely stamped out such behaviour, and buses were now much more reliable, punctual and safer, she admitted there was still one key area in which she wished she had done more.The former traffic commissioner said she had noticed sexism soon after taking over, and wondereddodgy operators told her wheels came off buses for no reason “because I was a girl”.She observed there had been some improvements, such as the “nonsense of naked lady photos” on depot walls being removed.But Ms Aitken said there remained “real issues” over increasing the number of women working in transport.A report by the cycling and walking body Sustrans Scotland last year highlighted that transport had the lowest percentage of women in senior posts within the public sector north of the Border - of just . per cent.In addition, despite comprising nearly half the UK workforce, women account for only around one in five transport workers.Ms Aitken observed that while there were some very successful female bus drivers and hauliers, working conditions remained a major deterrent to more women working in the sector.She said part of the problem was the lack of basic facilities, such as toilets, and suitable sht patterns.The Women in Transport group has stressed the importance of a more gender-balanced workforce to help better address women’s needs as passengers - since the majority on buses are female. With so few women at the helm of Scottish transport firms, it’s encouraging to see at least some new additions.As well as lawyer and engineer Claire Gilmore replacing Ms Aitken as traffic commissioner, Caroline Donaldson was this week appointed as managing director of the West Coast Partnership Development, which will help devise plans for HS, whose trains are due to run on to Edinburgh and Glasgow.She joins industry leaders such as bus firm Xplore Dundee managing director Christine McGlasson, and Scottish Canals chief executive Catherine Topley - but there should be many, many more.

We should be able to do spontaneous events there. ldquoIt would be a real shamethere were no events in the gardens in future ndash this is one of the arts capitals in the world. Princes Street Gardens is a place where that has got to play out.Brigadier Allfrey urged Edinburgh to follow the lead of other international cities and ensure that major events could be quickly staged and ed to normal as soon as possible in Princes Street Gardens.He added: ldquoWhen I look at other cities around the world they are operated to a very well-conceived vision. ldquoIn almost every single one of them an event happens and then it evaporates very quickly and thingsto normal.\"I think we can do this in Edinburgh.

It led me to consider just how quickly time passes, and indeed how it appears to pass more quickly as one travels through the years.It also took me down memory lane of the  and  general electionsI mention all of this because I urge readers to not believe anything is as presented in a general election by the leading political parties – or the media, who often have an agenda to push or have bought into some utterly ridiculous spin on why things seem as they do. Thankfully The Scotsman has eschewed taking an editorial line on which party to support in preference to seeking out the truth. No, what appears political reality is often a mirage, a poor reflection of what is actually happening a  paradigm that a Timelord might discover bears no relation to what is in the history books.This is where we are in this general election. We have esteemed experts, partisan politicians and bookmakers on the make all trying to tell us what is likely to happen – and the truth is they really do not know. How many of them would take a £ punt on what they tell us is the likely outcome  They can look at national polling, even regional polling they can play around with Electoral calculus which changes the colour of constituency maps as often as a Chameleon and they can attend focus groups to consider what biscuit each leader might be in the minds of the electorate.Yet they still cannot say what will happen.The reality I work under is that while there are national moods and regional swings there are also localised iations, and when with less than three weeks still to go a general election is as close as this one could be, it is in a small number of seats where the outcome will be decided.Last week I met an old friend, the former MEP Tim Aker who was a UKIP general election candidate in his local constituency of Thurrock in  and . Tim swears that it is only because of the strong campaigning by UKIP in Thurrock that the Conservatives defeated Labour on both those occasions. The reasoning is simple but compelling, the electoral ision of Thurrock is strongly eurosceptic and all the more so in Labour wards. Tim polled especially well in Labour heartlands such as Tilbury, so well that Labour lost enough votes in a three-way fight with the Tories for the Conservative Jackie Doyle-Price to hold the seat with a narrow majority.It is what we might call the Thurrock Effect, for it is not limited to Tim Aker’s personal intervention but is repeated in a crucial minority of constituencies across the land. The Thurrock Factor is where the intervention of a third-placed challenger such as UKIP, or in today’s case the Brexit Party, takes so many votes from the Labour candidate that the Conservatives win when the expectation is they will lose. As I wrote last week, Boris Johnson should win, but it is his to lose and Theresa May has shown how easily the Tories can fumble the ball. Thus In a time when the outcome is anything but clear constituencies, where the Thurrock effect might transpire could be the dference between a Johnson and Corbyn government. Seats such as Greater Grimsby are suddenly looking like good prospects for the Conservatives. In this Labour seat polling tells us that the Tory support has remained steady while Labour’s has declined by % with the intervention of the Brexit Party taking some % of the vote. This is a classic example of the Thurrock Effect.Other seats could experience the same phenomenon – or at least come close to scaring the bejeesus out of sitting Labour MPs. Everyone in Bishop Auckland, even Labour voters, tell me the incumbent Helen Goodman is unpopular. The Brexit Party has a good candidate in Nick Brown who should do well and could provide an upset, buthe doesn’t then the Tory Dehenna Davison could benefit from his campaigning winning over Labour voters, leaving her to seize the day. Other English seats such as Keighley, Rother Valley, Dewsbury and Wakefield fit this format. The common factor is these are all northern seats, where the Brexit Party could win a handful of Labour fiefdoms – or make it possible for the Tories to benefit from their hard work. So much for the Brexit Party splitting the leave vote and letting Jeremy Corbyn in – but don’t expect Boris Johnson to thank Nigel Farage for standing candidates in such marginals. Only a fortnight ago Johnson’s lieutenants were demanding Farage stand more of his candidates down.In Scotland the existence of the independence question changes everything. With the SNP decimating Labour in  and Corbyn’s party only coming third after the Tories in  the debate about Brexit has less resonance than in England and Wales – but it still matters.With Brexit Party candidates withdrawing from all Tory held seats the latest polling suggests the Conservatives are doing well in Scotland while Labour could lose all but Edinburgh South. I will go further and suggest there will be a perverse McThurrock Effect – where Labour voters who cannot stomach Corbyn hold their noses and vote Conservative as the most attractive unionist party, ironically helping the SNP to retain those marginal seats.This would be important, for seven of Labour’s top twenty target constituencies in the UK are held by the SNP. You don’t need to be a time traveller to work out Corbyn winning the general election will only exist in some parallel universe.Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lib dems vow to vote against scottish independence at every opportunity","story":"Liberal Democrats will vote against Brexit and Scottish independence \"at every opportunity we get\", Willie Rennie has pledged.At the partys manesto launch in Edinburgh, the Scottish Lib Dem leader said voters could trust them to oppose both Brexit and independence whatever the outcome of the General Election.The manesto is committed to revoking Article  in the event of a Lib Dem majority or by working alongside other parties to get a Peoples Vote with the option to remain.: Sajid Javid warns Nicola Sturgeon over pact with Labour partyArguing that to compromise on either position after the election would be a betrayal of their supporters, Mr Rennie said he had promised voters throughout the campaign that the Lib Dems would oppose Brexit and Scottish independence \"whatever the circumstances\".Speaking at Murrayfield Ice Rink, Mr Rennie said: \"We want to end the constitutional chaos and we will use our votes in Parliament at every opportunity to make it stop.\"Im saying to people on the doorsteps, Im saying to people in our leaflets, Im saying to people in our manesto - this is what you will getyou vote for us.\"I think thats very democratic and very straightforward.\"We cant go into an election saying were going to one thing butsomebody  gets a certain number of seats were going to do something dferent - thats not democracy.\"Mr Rennie acknowledged the Lib Dems had been \"condemned\" for going into coalition with the Tories in  but suggested there has been a rejuvenation in support for the party due to its steadfast opposition to Brexit since the EU referendum.On the issue of trust, Mr Rennie said: \"I think we are rebuilding that relationship with the voters because people see we are very clear with them, very straightforward and we will do what we say.\"No-one  is saying stop Brexit, stop independence.\"Labour are sitting on the fence and dithering on both, the Conservatives are wanting to add to the chaos with Brexit and the SNP dont seem to have learned any lessons from the last three and a half years that breaking up long-term economic partnerships is pretty dficult to do.\"He added the partys focus was on the two constitutional issues of EU membership and keeping the union together - in addition to tackling climate change and improving mental health support - rather than the prospect of backing either a Labour or Tory Government.\"Its up to other parties to explain whether they are going to do coalitions together, but dont count on us,\" Mr Rennie said.The partys Scottish manesto also calls for a \"federal-style\" working arrangement between the UKs nations to co-ordinate tackling the climate crisis, giving the Scottish Government a greater role on drugs policy and backing safe consumption rooms in places such as Glasgow where drug-related deaths are \"shockingly prevalent\".©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

SNP at this time only sensible vote in OS, despite their faults.I find your comment, #SNP at this time only sensible vote in OS, despite their faults.# quite extraordinary.Speaking of #absolute negativity#, has Ian read what he has written Quite extraordinary.Incidentally, I do not regard the brain dead posturing about climate emergency and putting bonnie Scotland under concrete as a positive policy. Probably not and largely because he does not actually want to be.Whether he cares to appreciate it or not, however, not all nationalisms are the same. The SNP#s outlook is internationalist, civic and largely social democratic, which underpins their considerable appeal.And I say that as a Labour Party member.Contrast that with the mean spirited, narrow minded, inward and backward looking, wall building, xenophobic and all too frequently sexist, racist and homophobic nationalism offered up by large elements of the Trump backed Brexit Party-Tory coalition and the dference is plain for all but the most willfully partisan to see.Nice to see Ian again outing himself as a climate change skeptic denier again though. Talk about brain dead posturing. He so likes thecut of the Tory candidate#s jib that he will do anything he can to distract attention away from consideration of her less than positive offering.When Jenny Fairbairn and Maurice Mullay write out their Xmas cards this year, I hope they don’t forget to send one to Jo Swinson.Such an omission would be truly ungrateful.Love you Peter, your even-handed comment is extraordinary.

Oh wait the EU fanzene the BBC does not show the scenes from Paris for some reason. I wonder why cops beating killing civilians in Hong Kong is deserving of condemnation but the same acts in Paris and Catalonia are met with silence  It is only the SNP that advocates covering Scotland with concrete. Their record speaks for itself. But never mind! Never forget Sturgeon was Salmond#s acolyte, scary pair!. They make your Labour party almost look liberal. Lower case l, please note.Plainly it is possible to join in a far-right orchestrated attack on Gretta Thunberg and like trees.Ian is trying to rewrite very recent history.As for Ali#s comments# not entirely sure I do espouse totalitarianism, or indeed merit his comparison with Hitler, Mao and Stalin.Likewow man, that#s pretty out there#!We can now take it as read that Ali has only got one conception of socialism, just as Ian only has one conception of nationalism.Don#t let facts get in the way of your painful to witness historical revisionism boys.These cheerful chappies should look up neo-liberalism and consider who funds the organisations which feed them their scary views, and why.The low tax paradise Ian, Ian, Farage and his pals in the AfD dream of won#t allow international action to address international problems, but it does deliver xenophobia, victim blaming and some pretty distorted perspectives.Kinda goes against their belief system to organize anything.Libertarian Ali is taking liberties.Where did he get these anarchists from Fairly sure I didn#t mention any.You know the sort of people that think their opinion should carry more weight than the majority vote.Looks like Ali believes the majority view can be mistaken after all. As he wrote but days ago: #Like most you will be claiming that hitler was far right but he was a socialist #.So he is definitely thinking most people are wrong on that point.And he is still wrong on there only being one type of socialist. Democratic socialists believe voters should have the chance to kick them out of power, but they can and have delivered long-lasting gains such as the minimum wage and the NHS.Under state socialism, such as under Stalin, self-proclaimed socialists take and keep full control. It is plainly a dferent thing to democratic socialism. Hitler#s National Socialists violently opposed democratic socialists, communists and everyone between, ergo not actually socialists. Hitler#s thinking didn#t track back to Marx, Engles or even Tolstoy. There is little point in contesting anything with libertarian Ali when he takes such liberties with the meaning of words.Does he even believe in general taxation for common services like health and education, or is that totalitarianism too Ali has been pretty unrestrained of late.Just how free does he want to be There is always room on Forvik.Maybe instead of me being exiled to Forvik as peter wants, maybe Peter should try a teaching exchange to Hong Kong, I bet his BS will go down a treat with students who have the misfortune to know socialism first hand.I have no problem with Greta, Peter. She is a fantastic example of how people can be manipulated by others. A lot of misplaced conviction, a lack of basic science and there you go. Stand up and bleat long and load and wait for the sheep to fall in behind. Anyway, things are looking up for her. Another sailing trip home on a super expensive sailboat. This one even has a loo! Nice workyou can get it.Really Ian, #She is a fantastic example of how people can be manipulated by others. A lot of misplaced conviction, a lack of basic science#But of course # your dental training trumps all that. You know best Ian. Bravo.Yet with all that experts beavering away not one of the forecasts have been anywhere near the mark, and still they want us to believe the next pile of BS they produceMy comment below seems relevant to yourself, , #I have never questioned a word about the actuality of climate change. What I have questioned is the moronic activity of the antics of “Extinction Rebellion”, ious ignorant politicians, especially some SIC and the SG SNP,with utter witlessness of the basic science.#For example, The SNPs latest foolishness, maximal profit from exploitation the North Sea Fossil fuels to finance Renewable initiatives !##Yet with all that experts beavering away not one of the forecasts have been anywhere near the mark, and still they want us to believe the next pile of BS they produce#Please show me the peer reviewed studies you are referencing that show otherwise. Oh wait. There are none. Maybe you can find something that confirms your beliefs on Breitbart though  I#m not the one peddling BS here#There is one science lesson Ian Tinkler can learn from Greta Thunberg. #The science has been unambiguous since the late s: the Earth is warming, humans are the cause, and the only way to combat this is through large-scale action taken by our world#s governments. The largest contributors to the causes of climate change — the addition of greenhouse gases to our planet#s atmosphere — come from just a few dozen corporations. In particular, % of all the emissions from  to  come from just  companies, practically all of which are fossil fuel producers.#There#s big money behind climate-change denial, so it is little surprise that dependable Ian#s understanding continues to be manipulated.Ian#s yet to explain how his #basic science# undermines the reliable scientic consensus that there is a big and urgent human-made climate problem.Before trying perhaps he should first attempt to understand how robust the scientic consensus is.This may help fantastic Ian to accept he#s been willingly had.I just love it how commenters on #climate change# seem to always start off by assuming everybody agrees that regardless what constitutes #climate change# this week, it#s somehow a #bad# and #negative# thing that must be stopped at almost any cost.Of all the incarnations of predicted impending #doom# that has been put forth over the last couple of decades or so on the subject, I#ve yet to find one that in my opinion was entirely #bad# through and through. Yes, in every scenario their will be perceived #losers#, but their will be winners too, right across the populations of all species on the globe, just as there have been perceived #losers# and winners across the populations of all species on the globe in the past and in the present whatever the #climate# has done.The only constant is change itself, and it is only those who fear change who are subscribing to the currentwave of #we#re all doomed# paranoia that#s been born out of some kind of manufactured mass hysteria guilt complex.No #Michael#. This scale of change is unprecedented and the #climate# is a real thing, as is the threat to it and us.Won#t be a problem thoughwe Get Brexit Done. Seriously though, how can there be winners in a species when the entire species is wiped out  Who is winning when the number of species facing extinction increases exponentially  What will that victory bring Surely increasing rates of species loss due to climate damage is a #bad# thing in anyones #opinon#.Concerning Greta,I admire her fortitude and courage but despise those people so driving her. I genuinely fear for her. She is a vulnerable youngster with genuine and real psychological problems. Greta is being so very exploited, by parents and politicians alike. I just hope she is not damaged in the process!I am waiting patiently for the local candidates to say something about something.I think there’s a reason for the silence Brian.For the last forty years, politicians have harped on and on about the devastating effects of Thatcherism.Now, at last, we have the chance to vote for a manesto that completely reverses the key changes that Thatcher made.We are being offered the chance to re-build the unions and re-nationalise the major utilities that Thatcher privatised.The problem is that none of today’s politicians want to reverse any of the changes that Thatcher made.Right now, they are all preparing their responses to this opportunity and it will take the form of statements like “The argument has moved on since then,”“Nationalisation is no longer relevant,” “That’s an outdated concept of socialism,” and “None of this would be relevantwe were independent.”All of these statements are, in fact, ways of saying that Thatcher was right but was just unpopular because she was ahead of her time.Apparently, We#re a# Jock Tamson#s bairns.Bollocks!Today’s “radical” politicians hav a’ become Margaret Thatcher’s bairns.Oh look!I see some Global Warming over there.Let’s change the subject.Expect the silence to continue.Thank God for Thatcher, she saved us from the spectre #Secretary Scargill# and his underling Corbyn.

The recreational society also employed the services of an independent surveyor who # using the drawings developed by the council for the school # drew up three dferent locations all of which were away from the pitch but within the existing school boundary.In a letter to council leader Margaret Davidson this week, Mr Blackford # a former chair of the recreational society # said that the alternative plans which would have allowed the new development while preserving the playing field seem to have been #rejected out of hand without adequate explanation#.He added that there was considerable concern that the council was going ahead with the proposals without #seeking to achieve a consensus of the parents and the wider community#.Mr Blackford invited Ms Davidson to host a meeting with him in Dunvegan at her earliest convenience so they could #listen to the voices of the community and give careful consideration as to how we can proceed with the school development whilst securing the playing field for this and future generations#., Mr Blackford said that the investment in the school was welcome but added that the plans #cannot come at the cost of the football pitch with no clear replacement plan in place#.He said that as the playing field in Dunvegan was the only one in the north-west of Skye, it would be #a disaster for Dunvegan and the surrounding areas# to see it go.At a meeting held in Dunvegan village hall last week, Highland Council estate strategy manager Robert Campbell said that the decision on the council#s preferred option had not #been taken lightly#. However, he added that the #best decision for this school is to build it on the playing fields#.The finance package for the phased build will comprise  per cent Scottish Government early learning and childcare funding and  per cent from Highland Council. The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":null,"title":"loneliness is truly the worst thing i have ever had to face","story":"Mary* was supported by Age NI to help her cope with the loneliness and grief she was experiencing after the death of her sister.Age NI helps people suffering from lonelinessShersquos sharing her story as part of Age NIrsquos No one should have no one turn to campaign, to raise awareness of the impact that loneliness can have.She hopes that by speaking out, people will be inspired to donate to Age NI this winter, to enable them to continue to support more people like her.She said: Irsquom .

The event, which also included a family and community fun day, marked the end of a year long refurbishment programme.The work commenced in October, last year when the main contractor Martin Hamilton, a Ballymena based company, arrived on site.Over the course of the next twelve months they completely transformed the inside of the church building as well as adding a new welcome hub.Over the past ten years the congregation has been thinking how best to provide st century facilities for a twenty first century church. Under the guidance of the design team of Kennedy Fitzgerald Architects, Williams  Shaw and Doran Consulting we have been able to take the project forward.The now current minister, Rev William Sinclair was called in September  and ministers along with associate minister Rev Matthew Boyd.First Ballymena Presbyterian Church was one of the first congregations to have an organ installed in the meeting house, and a new digital organ was installed during the current building project. Moving on from here, First Ballymena is a congregation that seeks to have a passion for Jesus Christ and a compassion for people. They want to engage with the community and be a compassionate church with a heart at the heart of the town of Ballymena. The new welcome hub helps open up the church and makes it an inviting place to be.Over the course of the past year, Matthew Boyd has joined William Sinclair in the ministry team and his main role is to strengthen the church’s mission in the community and to develop discipleship programmes in the congregation.Matthew Boyd stated his primary focus is on Discipleship and it has been encouraging to see just how God has been working in a number of people’s lives.Also as a church they have been going “over the wall” and engaging with people outside of the congregation who don’t yet know Jesus. It is the prayer of the church that God might continue to use them to reach out and point others to Jesus.

We move about  cattle and  sheep back and forth to our managed islands, as well as livestock to other privately-owned islands. In its first voyages, the new vessel will be used to bring livestock off for the winter.“We were delighted to be able to name it after Joe and it’s vital that we continue our work to provide ideal habitats for the curlews and other waders and wildle species in Lower Lough Erne. We are grateful to the European Union’s INTERREG VA Programme for funding this cot as part of CABB. A further aspect of the CABB project is to raise awareness in the community of the environmental, cultural and historical importance of these wetland habitats.”Joe added: “We originally used a wooden cot, which a farmer let us use. Then we built our own, although at first it had no engine on it and we had to tow it using another boat. So eventually we got an engine and that made le easier!“I knew that across the island of Ireland curlew numbers were dropping, so it’s important that work is still being done to look after them.”Thecot named the Joe Mageewill be used to transport livestock on and off islands, with the animals grazing resulting in an ideal habitat for breeding wading birds including the endangered curlewUnderlining the importance of this part of the project, Gina McIntyre, CEO of the SEUPB, said: “The curlew is one of a number of endangered priority species identied in the environmental protection measures within the EU INTERREG Programme. This new cot is a fantastic example of the tangible impact that EU INTERREG funding is having in safeguarding the natural environment and protecting endangered species, on a cross-border basis. Due to this intervention by the CABB project, curlews will have a much better future.

To be truthful I was in a very dark place. Irsquom not saying I was suicidal but probably close to it. ldquoI was . It was a strange thing. All I wanted to do was stay in the house and lock the door, but still the craving was there for company. Irsquod stand at the window hoping that the people walking past were coming for me.A collection was made of blankets and shoeboxes for SerbialdquoTherersquos a story going around about a person who was so lonely that he would post himself a letter just so the postman would come to the door to deliver it. That is very profound when you get to that stage. I wasnrsquot as bad as that but not far off it.Through Chest, Heart and Stroke, Robert found out about the Age NI club at North Road which ultimately led to his salvation: ldquoI turned up and what I saw actually amazed me ndash  elderly gentlemen discussing everything you can think of from finance to government to football to the shipyards.ldquoThis is exactly what I needed in my le at that time.ldquoThey were all strangers, and quickly became friends. Most of them have passed on unfortunately but we do have the present days menrsquos club. We still have  members and they are all fairly active and they are all great friends.Some of the participants at Age NI enjoying a game of bingoRobert said: ldquoYou have to take the step, but there is help thereyou do.ldquoAge NI do provide excellent help. Therersquos no doubt about it they go out of their way to encourage you to attend and to interact with other service users. And of course you have a meal here every day and a bit of chat.ldquoIrsquom here every day. Irsquom a service user two days a week a volunteer the other three days. Itrsquos such a wonderful service that I want to give something back.Robert, who used to work in the meat industry, commented: ldquoWork is important because it gives you a sense of purpose. Age NI gives you that same sense of purpose, a sense of being.You know there are people there willing to help you out.Discussing loneliness he said: ldquoThe loneliness factor is a strange one, you could be at a football match in a crowd of , and still be lonely.ldquoLe is so fast with the younger generation itrsquos hard to blame them for not checking on elderly neighbours. Itrsquos important for older people to look out for each other.Mabels storyMabel McCracken, who has been coming to Age NI for the past three years, agreed with Robert.ldquoEvery time yoursquore out you should say lsquohellorsquo ndash itrsquos important to be friendly, said the -year-old.Mabel told her story of how she came to be living on her own: ldquoI was a shorthand typist. I married my husband in . He was a cook during the war . We lived in Cyprus for three years and had two children ndash a girl and a boy, Michael and Anthea.ldquoMy dad was in a home and my mum wasnrsquot great by herself as she got older. I had orced and a got a flat in Clarawoodto be near my mum and dad. Now theyrsquore both gone.ldquoAll my aunts and everyone are gone except one cousin who comes to see me every Sunday and takes me shopping. My ex-husband is dead and my children, who live in Peterborough, come to see me every summer.ldquoWhen I broke my leg and was in hospital for six weeks I had to find somewhere  to live that was better suited to my mobility.Mabel, who now lives in secure accommodation for older people in east Belfast, said: ldquoHalf of the place is residents who canrsquot get out at all.ldquoIrsquom able to get out with my trolleyI order a taxi. Once a week I get picked up in the minibus and taken here. Irsquom the first on the bus.ldquoI really look forward to it, everybody is so good and nice. The people here feel like family. ldquoThe rest of the week gets very lonely. I watch TV but itrsquos not the same as talking with real people.ldquoItrsquos important to encourage people to take that first step out of the house, therersquos always help at the end of it.Wendy is head of a very happy familyAge NIrsquos day centre at the Skainos Centre is run by Wendy McKillion who is in the strange position of being lsquohead of the familyrsquo despite being younger than all of the people she cares for. The -year-old said: ldquoIt all starts when I have a referral from social services. I leave the centre to pay a home visit to assess the older people who really need to get out of the house, the people who are really isolated.ldquoIt is nice being in the position to offer somebody a social day at the centre ndash their lestyle improves as soon as they set foot through the door.ldquoTheyrsquore having a three-course home-cooked meal from our cook that we have on site. Jeanrsquos been with us for  years.ldquoBasically here at the centre the staff provide a good social day for service users. If theyrsquore having a good day wersquore having a good day.ldquoI have an open door policy that anyone at any time can come and have a private chat with me. They all have my mobile, they can get me any time and believe you me they do.ldquoItrsquos good security for them. If someone hasnrsquot turned up Irsquoll try to ring them or ring their next of kin, then go round and check on them.ldquoThey feel like my family. Some people only come in one day, some come in two, some come in three. It depends on inidual needs.ldquoIrsquove been looking after older people from I was in my twenties. It doesnrsquot get any easier when they pass away.Wendy, whose twin sister Gilly also works for Age NI, is full time with the organisation while many others lend their support on a voluntary basis:ldquoThe volunteers are worth their weight in gold. They could be semi-retired, they could be students, they could be people like Robert . All the time they give is appreciated.Recently Age NI teamed up with Blythswood Care to put together a relief package containing  blankets and  shoeboxes to be sent to Serbia.The group has had its share of celebrity mums with both Van Morrison and Dan Gordonrsquos mother attending.Proof that you donrsquot have to be alone to suffer from lonelinessLucy Quinn is proof that it is still possible to be lonely even when you come from a very large family.The east Belfast woman has eight children,  grandchildren and  great grandchildren.She said: ldquoI see my family very regularly but therersquos some days Irsquom just sitting in the house on my own. I bought myself a recliner chair and Irsquove got aframe to help me when I need to get up.ldquoIrsquod read magazines and do crosswords books to put the time in. I buy them to keep my brain active. Irsquod watch some TV as well.She said: ldquoI originally came from down by the shipyards. My father worked there and my brothers-in-law.ldquoMy husband died  years ago. He died aged  and one of my sons also died aged .ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking when you lose people who are very close to you.She commented: ldquoIt seems strange to say I get lonely when Irsquove got such a big family but loneliness isnrsquot straightforward.Lucy, who lives with her youngest daughter Karen, said: ldquoOne night Irsquoll have sevenin, sometimes there can be  or  of them in. You never know until they press the buzzer who will be coming.ldquoI have  grandchildren and great grandchildren. I think itrsquos  grandchildren and  great grandchildren.ldquoI give them all money for birthdays and Christmas. Therersquos too many to keep track of all their interests.ldquoThatrsquos how Irsquod spend most of my money. I save up. I donrsquot smoke and I donrsquot drink and I hardly ever go out.Lucy has been coming to Age NI for  years next May: ldquoThey used to be up in the North Road, I started off there.ldquoA girl called Valerie who used to the run the club, she said to myself and a couple of neighbours to come along. That was the start of it.ldquoIrsquom disabled, but not as much then as I am now.ldquoI love coming here. I come one day a week. When my daughters are all working it gives me something to look forward to.ldquoI love everything here, it would be the only exercise I get. ldquoThe cook is brilliant, Jean has been here since day one. ldquoThe craic is brilliant, I might be disabled but I can still carry on a joke.Older people in numbers in  older people are lonely in NIK older people in NI say that TV is their main form of companyAge NI has a total of  day centres across Northern Ireland.million people in the UK can go five or six days without seeing or speaking to anyoneThere are , people over the age of  living in Northern IrelandHow to help lonely peopleAge NI are at the forefront of change, enabling older people to have a voice and to remain independent, supporting those who need help in society and inspiring people to love later le. They help thousands of older people every year, providing advice, care and support when itrsquos needed most.If you suspect someone you know may be lonely, you can help by:Being there - Simply being there for the person can let them know that someone cares. Donrsquot be afraid to ask them how they are feeling ortherersquos anything you can do to help. Having someone who is willing to listen could be a great comfort.Encourage and support them to get help - Reassure them that itrsquos possible to feel better with the right help. They may need some support to make new social connections or access services designed to tackle loneliness, such as Age NI day centres, and Wellbeing services.Be patient - When people are lonely, particularlyitrsquos associated with poor mental health or physical health, they may get irritable or feel misunderstood by others.

Set in an old theatre in the s, the former St Genevieve’s pupil’s take on the festive and timeless classic will take families of all ages through a journey as they watch all the characters come together to show Ebenezer Scrooge the error of his ways.“The MAC’s Christmas audience is quite young so to introduce three ghosts can become quite scary so you have to work with that,” she said. “They always say write what you know and I know the theatre. I’ve set the story in a theatre where Scrooge is a producer, along with Jacob Marley they were the big theatre producers of the day. There is a term in threatre called the ‘ghost light’ this would have been turned on through the night so that people, who were still working through, wouldn’t have fallen through the trapdoor. I loved that idea and thought this would work as a way to introduce our ghosts. “This theatre, which Scrooge is in charge of, isn’t making the profit it used to the ghosts come to le in the hope that Scrooge won’t close down the theatre. The kids who will be in the audience are helping us create this story and it’s a way to introduce such a classic to a younger audience,” she said. Having starred in panto since she was , Tara Lynne will also be starring in Xmas For Dummies at the Grand Opera House with Chris Robinson, “an adult take on the classic ’s film Mannequin,” set in Castle Street.“It’s an hour of a show, either before or after your Christmas party to come in and have a laugh with us. I’m only in one of them so you’ll not be sick of my face,” she laughed.Having wowed audiences with her Shirley Valentine at The Lyric stage earlier this year, Tara Lynne exclusively reveals that her one-woman tour de force is coming back in  for a new run. “I’m really excited to be coming back with the show. The amount of feedback we got from people for a -year-old play was amazing. Everybody was coming up to me saying how they had ‘got a bit of Shirley in me’.“You could’ve heard a pin drop most nights in The Lyric. The support for the piece was unbelievable, it is such a gt of a show.”When not writing, acting or preparing to travel to ‘Greece for a fortnight’, Tara Lynne will be donning ‘Ma’s’ wig again as filming for Derry Girls series three gets underway in April.“I can’t wait to see what Lisa has instore for this series, I don’t think anyone can wait. It’s all very top secret at the minute. The scripts are so good, let’s hope I don’t get killed off or leave in a black taxi as that’s what happened me in Eastenders,” she laughed.

I always pushed mum and dad to put more decorations up but they never gave in.“I probably started to enjoy it more when I had my own place and could decorate as much as I like.“When I moved out, I remember buying a lot of stuff for the first Christmas in my new place“I ended up buying more and more. It was like an addiction.“From the start of October, I get itchy feet to get the decorations up. I love the lead-up to Christmas, especially having friends round who compliment my display every year.“I wanted to be more organised this year because I am going to New York before Christmas. I can’t wait – it is the main place to see at Christmas and no doubt I will do more shopping for things I can use next year in the house.”Paul, who works in household store Nobletts in North Street also helps design their annual window display.“I’ve just finished getting the window display done for Nobletts. People have been asking me to do theirs too, so there may be a business idea there for me in the future.“It is something I look forward to doing every year at Nobletts. I specialise in interior design so I know quite a bit about colours and display.“The store even won a competition for the Best Window Display in Europe a few years ago so I was very proud of that.”Askedhe had a message for any bah, humbugs out there, Paul said, “Stay inside and don’t bring any negative energy near me.“At the end of the day, I can’t make people embrace Christmasthey don’t want to.”Mum, Sylvia says despite loving her son’s effort and display, she could never put her own house Christmas decorations and tree up this early.“It gets me in the mood for Christmas too but I could never have my tree and decorations up this early.“I love coming down to his house, especially at night time when it is all lit up and looks fantastic. The work that Paul puts in is amazing.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"finucane i wont be put off by negative campaign","story":"NORTH Belfast Sinn Féin Westiminster candidate John Finucane has said he will not be deterred by what he describes as a “very coordinated and sophisticated campaign” against him.Banners targeting John Finucane and his family have been erected by unionists in recent days ahead of December  polling day.The Lord Mayor sat down with the North Belfast News in Belfast City Hall with the election, local issues and a border poll all on the agenda.“The banners are part of a very coordinated and sophisticated campaign designed to intimidate me, denigrate my family and my father’s memory and designed to deter me,” he explained.“It is gutter politics of the worst kind and not something I am allowing to distract and deter me. I remain focused on delivering for North Belfast.“It has generally been a positive campaign so far. The dynamic that this election transcends party politics is being received on the doors. That positive message about maximizing the Remain vote is being received very well.“We are running a very positive campaign by looking to the future by delivering better for North Belfast. It is an area as the readers will know that has been left behind and has many challenges. I want to be an MP to get stuck into those challenges.”Mr Finucane and his party have also faced criticism from opponents regarding Sean Kelly, the man convicted of the  Shankill bomb, who has worked as a party canvasser in North Belfast. However, John Finucane pointed to remarks by leading victims’ campaigner Alan McBride, who lost his we in the Shankill bomb, urging all political parties to be mindful of victims at election time.“Alan McBride is one of the most impressive people that I have met. He is considerate and well-measured,” said John.“His response to this debate is something everyone needs to listen to. I have and the party has, of being mindful and respectful of victims at election time. He has also called out the banners which are hurtful to those families who lost loved ones in the Shankill which I agree with.“He also called out the DUP hypocrisy on this issue – a party which has convicted drug dealers canvassing for them, engages with active loyalist paramilitaries connected with offences up to and including murder this year. Alan has been a strong and reasonable voice in this debate and I welcome his comments.”In an election that many see isabout Brexit, Sinn Fein’s long-standing abstentionism policy at Westminster has once again surfaced but Mr Finucane is adamant protection for the people of Ireland does not come from the green benches of the House of Commons. “It is an issue which has come up on the doors. Since the last Westminster election and the dynamic between the DUP and the Tories, there is absolutely no appetite by the British government to compensate or consider the impact of Brexit on the people of Ireland. It is not on their radar at all.“The DUP got spectacularly thrown under the bus and showed that no matter what your constitutional aspirations are, the British government simply does not careyou live in this part of the world.“Those who want to protect their European identity or voted to Remain – the protection is never coming from the green benches of Westminster. The protection comes from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and the EU  and in America, supported by Sinn Féin.”John Finucane will contest a close-fought election contest with the DUP’s outgoing MP Nigel Dodds, someone many see as the chief architect of a hard Brexit.“Hewould be proud of that title. He was part of the Vote Leave campaign. He has been the DUP head at Westminster and is proud of his Brexit record.“The two defining political moments in my letime have been the Good Friday Agreement and Brexit and Nigel Dodds is on the wrong side of history in both of those. He continues to be opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and he continues to champion Brexit which goes against the majority of people’s views in North Belfast which is hopefully reflected on December .”Looking at local issues affecting North Belfast, the Sinn Féin candidate wants to address food banks, the mental health crisis, housing and anti-social behaviour, amongst others.“In North Belfast, we have food banks, a mental health crisis, reliance on prescription drugs, very toxic legacy from the conflict, suicide crisis particularly amongst our young people.“I don’t want to refight old battles or use the past to poke my neighbour in the eye. People want to move forward with political leadership that can do just that.”He said the DUP’s record on housing “is despicable”.“They object to housing for reasons that can be interpreted as nothing short of sectarian,” he said. “This is the brand of politics I think North Belfast wants to turn its back on. Housing is a right that is founded and based on need and nothing to do with religion, who you vote for or ethnicity.“North Belfast has a housing crisis – we are top of all the tables you don’t want to be top of and bottom of all the tables you don’t want to be bottom of.There are areas of land that need to be used for housing. There needs to be a major overhaul. We are up against a lot of opposition which the DUP are at the heart of.“Mental health, bonfires and anti-social behaviour are all linked in many ways. It is no surprise that those involved in anti-social behaviour come from economically-deprived and challenging backgrounds.“I was in the New Lodge this week and saw for myself the good work that is being done to remove people from engaging in anti-social behaviour. The community doesn’t want it. I think it was unfortunate this year to see the response of the police that eroded a lot of confidence from the local community.“Hard work needs to continue all year around. Statutory bodies, police and council all have a responsibility too. There is a lot of positive work happening – one example is the Féile dance night which takes young people away from bonfires.“From my day job as a solicitor, I know there are complicated reasons why people find themselves in the criminal justice system. The work has started and continues to operate all year around.”Asked about a border poll, John was quick to urge caution.“I don’t think we are ready for it tomorrow. The inevitability of a border poll is accepted and I say that, having listened to unionists.

Planning approval for Casement was quashed in December . The two other stadium projects have been completed.Revised plans were submitted in February  with a reduced spectator capacity of ,. The plans are still being assessed by planning officials.In a letter sent on behalf of Ulster GAA, Tom Daly said the plans “continue to be encumbered by a prolonged planning process”.“Mondaymarks , days since Ulster GAA submitted its planning application in February  for an iconic new Provincial Stadium in Belfast which would deliver the last strand of the Regional Stadia Development Programme, a key commitment within the NI Executive Programme for Government.“The completion of Kingspan Ravenhill Stadium for Ulster Rugby and the Irish Football Association’s Windsor Park Stadium is bringing signicant benefits to their members and to wider society and it is obvious that the provisions of modern infrastructure has helped develop the profile and standing of both sports.“At Ulster GAA we are determined that , association members and new visitors to our games will enjoy similar benefits once the long-standing commitment made to us by Government are fulfilled.”Cost of the new stadium now stands at £ million,  per cent more than the initial £. million budgeted.The Department for Infrastructuresaid it recognizes the importance of the planning application for Casement Park.“We appreciate that there is frustration at the time taken to process it, however this is a complex proposal where dferent views and concerns are apparent. It is essential that the planning process is progressed in a thorough, fair and objective manner that ensures that all relevant factors are considered.#The Department has pursued comments from all consultees in order to complete its professional assessment of the application and these have now all been received. We have met with the applicant#s team with a further meeting planned, to see how a small number of outstanding issues related to Roads matters can be progressed.#We are working hard to progress the planning application to the point where it is ready for a decision to be made. The next stages will depend on the political and legislative context that applies at that point.#West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told Daily Belfast that he shares the “same frustration” that the GAA have expressed.“I’ve met with the GAA Casement development team on many occasions and they have submitted all relevant information to planners over the last three years.“In my view the planners have had enough time to review this case in all its detail and they should make the decision soon.“I’ve met with the planners regularly and I continue to push them to make the decision. I have pointed out to them that other major planning applications have been submitted to the planners after Casement Park application and they’ve been approved. I know they have to make sure they get it right as there was a legal ruling on it but , days is long enough,” he said.“Casement, when built, will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast. We’ve seen major development in recent years including the new Andersonstown leisure centre almost next door and that will be completed early next year.“The vast majority of people want to see it built, they know the benefits that it will bring. Hopefully a decision will be taken by the planners in the very near future.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38740944.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Run_Forest_Run_Loughgall028.jpg","title":"belfast telegraph run forest run loughgall 5k","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I dont think hehas much support. I dont know too many people who would support a Labour Government under Corbyn. In fact, I dont know anybody.\"Mr Black reflected on how he and his community have been subject to anti-Semitism here in Northern Ireland in the past, and how in most cases it is related to ignorance about the Jewish faith.\"Ive had abuse online because of my background. We have also seen issues in Belfast. There are a small number of people who wouldnt see my point of view,\" he added.\"There is a lot of ignorance as well. People say things not necessarily meaning anything, but just through ignorance. I meet people who have never actually met a Jew before. It is not part of their le. They wouldnt understand and know the things I would be involved in.\"It would just be another world to them.\"Askedhe had any personal advice for Mr Corbyn, Mr Black urged the Labour leader to strike a balance in his comments and \"be a bit more critical of the other side\".He said: \"Fair enough, be critical of the government of Israel, but I never hear them criticising the likes of Hamas, Hezbollah and the Palestinian leaders.\"Labour has hit back at the Chief Rabbis claims and insisted: \"Jeremy Corbyn is a lelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no one who engages in it does so in his name.\""},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile greens could help sdlp slide over line in south belfast","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Despite Ulster Unionist Michael Henderson standing, she should secure a massive unionist vote.DUP Balmoral councillor David Graham is running her campaign, and doesnt think it is a lost cause.\"Emma got over , votes last time, and there is room for growth in our core area,\" he says.\"If you compare our  bestboxes in the constituency with the top  nationalist boxes in  - when we did exceptionally well - there was still a far higher proportion of people in our best areas who didnt vote or werent even registered.\"Weve done a lot of work on the ground to change that, and unionist voters are very motivated for this election. Emma grew unionist turnout in , and we need to do that again. I think we will as people realise it has never been more important to defend the Union.\"Graham also cites the outgoing MPs grassroots endeavours: \"Emma has dealt with over , cases in her office in her two years as an MP. Christopher Stalford is a hard-working MLA and we have an excellent council team locally. That helps us hugely.\"Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw The key to the DUPs chances is how Alliance fares. If the Remain camp is fairly evenly split and Hanna doesnt pull signicantly ahead of Bradshaw, then Little-Pengelly should win.Support for Bradshaw next month is dficult to predict. The SDLP was , votes ahead of Alliance in . Yet the Naomi factor and the partys extraordinary success in the EU election may have changed the dynamic.Alliance surged ahead of the SDLP in Mays council poll. But the fact Bradshaw stood as an Ulster Unionist Conservative candidate in  might limit her reach more than it would an Alliance candidate without such a history.Ray Kennedy was the SDLPs election guru in South Belfast for two decades. He ran Alasdair McDonnells campaigns. He says: \"This seat is now Claire Hannas to lose. But I think it will be tight at the top with the SDLP just edging it over the DUP, and Alliance coming a good third.\"Alasdair won around , soft unionist votes in . I reckon theyre in doubt, with these voters perhaps switching to Alliance or staying at home.\"The SDLPs perceived pact with Sinn Fein doesnt help as its being sold by others as a sectarian pact.\"However, Kennedy sees Hanna winning support where. \"Claire wont get % of the Green vote, but she will get a fair chunk. But I think she will secure no more than half Sinn Fein votes, and perhaps only a third,\" he says.\"The benchmark will be whether she manages to get as high a turnout as Alasdair in and the SDLP won over , votes.\"While forecasting defeat for Alliance this time, Kennedy predicts future growth.\"Alliance did very well in the council election, but the archaic and undemocratic first-past-the-post system for Westminster doesnt suit the party,\" he says.\"I see it occupying the same space in South Belfast as we did  years ago. Alasdair ran for Westminster and wasnt close, but he made up ground in every election and we used that momentum to grow our vote. Alliance will do similarly. It has bright prospects ahead.\""},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile no change likely in newry and armagh but some sinn fein voters ponder a switch to dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The whole thing has been going on too long,\" he said.\"Sure the Union itself could be broken before they get out of Europe - Scotland could leave the UK before it leaves the EU.\"And with all the mix-up at Westminster there will be a lot of people who will not come out to vote at all, I think. It has become a real laughing stock.\"One woman from nearby Warrenpoint who is among those who want to remain anonymous said people are more angry than confused.\"The parties just go for their own agenda rather than anything  and the ordinary people just have to put up with the state of hospitals and schools in decline and cuts left, right and centre,\" she said.Apart from the big ticket issues, the main local concern appears to be a vicious spate of break-ins which has plagued a number of towns and villages.And in Newtownhamilton there is palpable public outrage over proposals for a super-dump just outside the town which they fear would involve hundreds of tonnes of non-recyclable waste.Nonetheless Brexit appears to be front and centre in most peoples minds and the issue they hope most the election will finally sort out.Mr Brady has attacked Boris Johnson over his recent visit to Tayto Castle in Tandragee without informing him - although Downing Street insisted the election means MPs no longer have to be told.\"He sneaked into Tandragee on an unannounced visit, but he cant escape the fact that the majority of people in the north have rejected the reckless Tory Brexit,\" he said.\"He may want to avoid the people but he cant avoid the polls.\"Mr Johnson said he was unaware Mr Brady, who he referred to as \"the honourable member who does not take his seat\", had not been informed.Mr Irwin, meanwhile, has said he believes Brexit will have to be \"out of the way\" before the Assembly can be restored, but believes EU withdrawal will allow the regions agri-food sector to move towards self-sufficiency.The DUP candidate added: \"Being outside the EU and free from many of the bureaucratic burdens that come with the baggage of EU membership, it is certainly the case that our processors and retailers can source a much greater amount of food home grown within the UK.\"The UUPs Sam Nicholson, chair of the partys councillors association, will be hoping to mop up anti-DUP unionist votes along with unionist Remainers coalescing around new leader Steve Aikens position that staying in the EU is better than Johnsons deal to leave. He has pledged to put people at the very heart of policy in rebuilding his party \"from the grassroots up\".Though a largely rural area, it is the only constituency in Northern Ireland with two cities - Armagh and Newry - and only created less than  years ago, in  as a result of the increase of Northern Ireland seats from  to then .

CONAL McFEELY says the findings have been both enlightening and compelling. In his seminal book, ‘Derry: Countdown to Disaster’ , the former Derry Journal editor Frank Curran catalogued how fty years of isolation and discrimination led to the outbreak of the Troubles in this city. Recent events, such as the failure of political governance, the collapse of the institutions, and the uncertainty over Brexit here, are being used by some sections of the media to suggest we are now in danger of a similar spiral. googletag.cmd.push The reality on the ground in communities such as Creggan is that there is, admittedly, huge frustration. Despite the peace process, Creggan - along with many already disadvantaged areas of Derry – has never escaped a legacy of endemic poverty, joblessness, housing problems and low educational attainment. This is now compounded by anxiety over Brexitand the political vacuum here, which has left many people feeling voiceless and powerless. But, for all the dissatisfaction and exasperation here, there is no appetite whatsoever on the ground for ato what our community experienced during the troubles. googletag.cmd.push There is no doubt, however, that we need help. Urgently. And, importantly, we need long-term solutions – not short-term fixes – to reverse and redress the politics of economic isolation. Local people know of old that it is pointless waiting on Stormont to intervene on our behalf. Even in the new, post-Good Friday Agreement era of equality, this city overall has continued to experience economic isolation.  So, what is needed for Creggan   Surveys conducted at Rath Mor over Autumn  established, the community wants: middot A fresh, current and strategic vision for the area. Creggan needs a comprehensive long-term plan to reassess and revise its approach to community development with a view to enhancing the physical, mental, economic, educational and social well-being of its residents. middot Support for community infrastructure, capital and physical environment projects to help address social and economic exclusion, improve community image, grow new business, tackle poverty, advocate for those in need, create new employment and stimulate social innovation. middot Support for a targeted social enterprise strategy to promote civic engagement and community ownership. Creggan will always struggle to attract inward investment, instead we need a viable stimulus package for indigenous business. The ethos is not just about developing sustainable businesses – it is about contributing to the social and economic profits for the advantage and benefit of the local community. middot Support for a new Intermediate Labour Market initiative. Creggan needs a dedicated ILM scheme – providing sustainable jobs and experience, skills and qualications which are most in demand by employers. The scheme should be highly focused on helping those iniduals most in need, and most at risk. middot Support for inclusive development vehicles. It is imperative that any new support service, or targeted employment or skills building initiative be inclusive and independent. It must be implemented delivered by a neutral mechanism, engage with all sides of the community and be pragmatic about removing barriers to work and supporting personal transition. middot Continued support for health and wellbeing initiatives. Creggan suffers from a range of signicant physical and mental health challenges, and despite this Creggan has been devoid of a dedicated doctor’s surgery for over  years. Creggan Enterprises have been working diligently to bringing this service provision to the area for the last decade. January  will see the realization of this new flagship health project for the community in partnership with Bayview Medical. Government or independent funding support should be directed at these types of projects which provide meaningful, tangible and most importantly sustainable benefits to the community. middot Support for schools, families and young people. Creggan needs targeted and focused early years, youth and parentalprevention and intervention programmes which are fully inclusive and engage those most in need, at risk, marginalised or excluded from existing provision. middot Support for programmes which engage the elderly, address social isolation and support those most vulnerable in our community to the impacts of poverty, austerity and cuts as a result of failure in political governance. middot Support for inclusive community dialogue. Without the opportunity and  for dialogue we are left with continuous community isions and conflict. And whilst Creggan has suffered very negative media coverage and ‘community profiling’ in recent times – there is a sustained need to develop viable community safety initiatives which are fully inclusive an accountable to everyone. middot Support for initiatives which deal with the past. At the centre of much of Cregganinter and intra-community conflict – is the community’s inability to tackle legacy conflict issues – lacking an effective mechanism for dealing with the past. middot Support for new educational and cultural partnerships. Creggan over the past few years has been hosting regular Summer School schemes for international visitors – as has partnered on peacebuilding projects with the likes of Yale University, Boston College, Temple University, John Moore and many more – tying in with their political science, international studies or peacebuilding  conflict studies courses. We would seek to broaden out this offering and formalise this Summer School as a standalone initiative. Creggan, and Derry in general, needs a st century recovery programme, particularly in light of the potential catastrophic impact of Brexit on the North West. And whilst financing, job creation and early intervention prevention-based work is at the core of any important proposal – every effective development plan needs flagship projects to stimulate public interest, generate healthy debate and communicate a vision, for example: A new, independently-run university Derry needs a new university. A new, independently-run university – which would come under the auspices of the National University of Ireland and be supported by the Irish government – is one certain way to begin redressing the balance. It would also serve as a beacon of hope for those who cannot see their future in this city – and it would serve as a declaration of intent of the Irish government’s commitment to Good Friday Agreement. A university’s letime can run into centuries – Derry, this island’s most ancient Christian settlement, needs a guarantee of its longevity and of a prosperous future. Regardless of what happens after any election now or next year – we must ensure that our young people have access to enhanced economic and educational opportunities going forward. Time is long overdue to address community abandonment and short-termism by central government.

A FOOTBALL St Patricks Maghera - St Marys Magherafelt - Jody McDermott landed a th minute winner, with the last kick of Saturdays cagey decider in Bellaghy.

Jody McDermott’s late free wins the @ulsterschools #RannafastCup for Maghera@StPatsMaghera -@PE_stmarys - pic kRRZvetc — County Derry Post November ,     It was a cruel blow on a Magherafelt side that controlled the game for much of the hour. For St Marys recently appointed GAA Development Officer Johnny McGurk, it was a bittersweet afternoon. While the former Maghera pupil co-managed Magherafelt, his son Patrick came out on the winning side where handled plenty of possession in his sweeper role. googletag.cmd.push Both teams qualied for the final on the back of pulsating semi-final displays but this was a game of chess. The sides were levelat the break, but Maghera wouldve been the happier side given six Magherafelt wides and Conall Herons goal chance coming back off the post. St Marys continued their dominance and thanks to Diarmuid Mulhollands th minute goal, they went into a three point lead. Scores were at a premium but Maghera almost replied with a goal when Luke Diamond met Peter McCullaghs high cross-field ball but goalkeeper Tiarnaacuten McOscar tipped his fisted effort over the bar. googletag.cmd.push Two frees from the unflappable McDermott leveled matters after  minutes but Magherafelt were soon ahead with a booming score from Niall ODonnell. It would prove to be the last score for The Convent. Callum Downey, likes his cousin Conor did in the Corn na nOacuteg final last week, brought the sides level in the closing stages. Maghera owned the ball but survived a late scare when Ryan McEldowneys free dropped into a packed square. There were vocal appeals for touching on the ground but the well-placed Paul Faloon waved play on and Raymond Dillon won a free out. With extra-time looking highly likely, Maghera continued with their patient brand of football until Cathal Chambers won a the late free and McDermotts winner sealed the title. After the game, Ulster Schools Chairman Jimmy Smyth presented the cup to winning captain Adam McGonigle,  years after his father Barry and uncle Marty were on Magheras victorious Rannafast winning side.

A FOOTBALL St Patricks Maghera - St Marys Magherafelt - Jody McDermott landed a th minute winner, with the last kick of Saturdays cagey decider in Bellaghy. When Cathal Chambers was fouled, he was faced with a free from a tight angle but the Glen man held his nerve to nail the pressure kick in front of an attendance of around ,. Jody McDermott’s late free wins the @ulsterschools #RannafastCup for Maghera@StPatsMaghera -@PE_stmarys - pic kRRZvetc — County Derry Post November ,     It was a cruel blow on a Magherafelt side that controlled the game for much of the hour. For St Marys recently appointed GAA Development Officer Johnny McGurk, it was a bittersweet afternoon. While the former Maghera pupil co-managed Magherafelt, his son Patrick came out on the winning side where handled plenty of possession in his sweeper role. googletag.cmd.push Both teams qualied for the final on the back of pulsating semi-final displays but this was a game of chess. The sides were levelat the break, but Maghera wouldve been the happier side given six Magherafelt wides and Conall Herons goal chance coming back off the post. St Marys continued their dominance and thanks to Diarmuid Mulhollands th minute goal, they went into a three point lead. Scores were at a premium but Maghera almost replied with a goal when Luke Diamond met Peter McCullaghs high cross-field ball but goalkeeper Tiarnaacuten McOscar tipped his fisted effort over the bar. googletag.cmd.push Two frees from the unflappable McDermott leveled matters after  minutes but Magherafelt were soon ahead with a booming score from Niall ODonnell. It would prove to be the last score for The Convent. Callum Downey, likes his cousin Conor did in the Corn na nOacuteg final last week, brought the sides level in the closing stages. Maghera owned the ball but survived a late scare when Ryan McEldowneys free dropped into a packed square. There were vocal appeals for touching on the ground but the well-placed Paul Faloon waved play on and Raymond Dillon won a free out. With extra-time looking highly likely, Maghera continued with their patient brand of football until Cathal Chambers won a the late free and McDermotts winner sealed the title. After the game, Ulster Schools Chairman Jimmy Smyth presented the cup to winning captain Adam McGonigle,  years after his father Barry and uncle Marty were on Magheras victorious Rannafast winning side.

Born with spina bida and hydrocephalus , seven-year-old Seanain McCallion and her family have been regular users of Hospice services since Seanain was just  months old and this festive season she is wishing for donations to ensure young people affected by le-limiting conditions across Northern Ireland can avail of these leline services. Seanain, who requires -hour care, has received a new diagnosis each year of her le and will undergo further surgery next month. Cold weather further exasperates Seanain’s symptoms and as a result she is often ill over the Christmas period. As it is her favourite time of year, the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice threw an early Christmas party for Seanain in June so she could celebrate the holiday with her family. Seanain’s mum, Kathleen, said: “Seanain loves fairytales and dressing up so you can imagine the delight on her face when she arrived at the party to be met by Elsa and Anna, the princesses from Disney’s Frozen. “She had an amazing day singing her heart out to all her favourite Disney songs with her sisters Grace and Chloe, and really feeling like a princess for the day. It was a magical day for the whole family to have such a precious day together. “We are so grateful to the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice for arranging the party and allowing us to make wonderful memories together.”The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice further surprised Seanain by creating an animated Princess character of the youngster. “The Princess Seanain character looks fantastic. She has a wheelchair, glasses, dark hair and a big smile, just like Seanain. It was another incredible surprise,” Kathleen continued. The Northern Ireland’s Children’s Hospice is the only children’s Hospice in Northern Ireland and cares for young people of all ages including babies. Kathleen said: “When we were first referred to the Hospice that was very daunting as there is a misconception that Hospice services are only suitable for those at the end of le. How wrong that is! “The Hospice has honestly opened a whole new world for us and we feel incredibly lucky to have the security net for support when we need it most. “As Seanain gets older her needs are increasing and as her main carer it can be extremely exhausting. When Seanain goes to the Hospice to stay for a couple of days, she absolutely loves it and looks forward to it like other kids look forward to weekend sleepovers.“The staff go above and beyond and are on hand to cater for each and every one of Seanain’s needs. It’s incredible how relaxed we are to leave her overnight because we know that she just loves being there, and for my husband and I, having that alone time together is really important. “The care provided is amazing, and not just to Seanain but to her siblings and the entire family. It feels like a second home to us all. It’s a place where Seanain gets to have fun and live as normal a le as possible. She is such a bright spark and is determined to control her disability rather than let it control her. “The Hospice needs to raise huge amounts of money every year to continue providing these services to children like Seanain and I really hope that people can support the Hospice and make a donation of whatever they can afford this Christmas.” Kathleen is hoping that  will be a healthier year for Seanain following next months surgery. Heather Weir, chief executive at Northern Ireland Hospice said: “Seanain is a very special girl and we are just thrilled she enjoyed her early Christmas party and her Princess animation so much. “It is a pleasure to have her staying in the Hospice and we’re very proud to have her feature in our Little Stars Christmas Appeal encouraging donations for the Hospice. “It costs pound. million each year for Northern Ireland Hospice to provide high level palliative care and support to people of all ages across Northern Ireland, in their homes and in our specialist facilities. Only % of that is received through statutory funding which means we rely on fundraising efforts for the remaining pound million. “To put these figures in perspective, it costs pound. for us to deliver one hour of nursing care in the Children’s Hospice and pound. would cover the cost of  minutes of specialist Hospice care to accompany children in the multi-sensory room or in our hydrotherapy pool. “I hope that raising awareness of the breadth of services we offer at Hospice, will encourage people to make a donation which can go towards care for children with le-limiting conditions such as Seanain.”To make a once-off or recurring donation, or to find out how you can get involved with a fundraising event of your own please visit www.nihospice.org googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It aims to provide transparency around the business of Community Planning and the performance of the statutory and support partners tasked with its delivery.The report was launched at a meeting of the Strategic Growth Partnership in the Guildhall, where it was widely welcomed by the local stakeholders who have been working in conjunction with Council since the power of Community Planning was handed down in .The Statement contains positive indications that change is already beginning to take effect in seven out of the eight outcome areas prioritised in the plan, with progress occurring at a faster rate than expected.Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor Michaela Boyle, welcomed the Statement and acknowledged the tangible results that have already been achieved. “I am delighted to see the many indicators of positive change within the Statement of Progress,” she declared. This is of course a long term strategy and there are many signicant challenges that will take time to address before we can enjoy the full benefits of real and lasting change. There is a long way to go, but the foundations have been laid through this process towards achieving a bright and positive future – we just need to maintain this momentum to fully achieve the level of prosperity and wellbeing we all aspire to.”Council chief executive, John Kelpie, said strong partnership working had been the main driver of progress. “From the outset we have been ambitious in our approach and I am reassured that the results confirm that this has been the right strategy to initiate positive change. In terms of active delivery progress is more signicant and visible than we expected at this stage.”The Statement of Progress reveals a changing picture in Derry and Strabane since the Inclusive Strategic Growth Plan was first published in November . In terms of the local economy the City and District saw its highest jobs figure to date in  as we begin to close the gap with the N. Ireland average in our employment rate. While there are still gaps with regards to job creation and skills development work continues to get more people working in better jobs.The latest figures also show a high level of academic performance at GCSE and A-Level and overall academic performance, while growth has occurred in areas such as tourism with more overnight trips, visits and expenditure.Environmental wellbeing has also improved, with decreases in Co emissions, an increase of % in our household waste recycling rate, improvements in our parks and green spaces, and further development in terms of our roads infra- structure, greenways and the opening of the multi-modal transport hub. Work continues on the new Local Development Plan which will shape planning policy for the better, improving the quality of the environment around us. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These studies show that bi-lingual children achieve higher levels in literacy and numeracy than their mono-lingual peers - including in English. They are better able to learn additional languages, and are more open to other cultures as a result.Bilingual children demon- strate additional creativity, as their brain develops in a way that encourages lateral thinking, and finally, they are also more adept in social situations, as they are used to switching codes in dferent settings, and are more socially confident as a result.There is the added advantage of developing fluency in an indigenous language unique to Ireland, and there are additional cultural advantages to attending Irish medium education, in terms of access to traditional music, sport, heritage and culture, as well as additional employment opportunities in the growing Irish language community across the island.It goes without saying that Irish medium schools welcome children of all backgrounds.On top of this, Club Oacuteige Setanta  provides a wide range of out of school facilities for Irish speaking children in the city both within and outside of term time. This dovetails with Irish language summer camps for children attending Irish medium schools, as well as special activities for St Patricks Day, Halloween, Christmas and Easter. The club currently has  children enrolled, and is in the process of developing its own purpose built premises. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Whether its little Alex here and his impromptu Irish conversation, or an over-excited child flying by before Ryan has even said their name, thewheeled section of the show is often its finest moment! Ryan will repeatedly and aggressively poke a toy with a microphone...  When it doesnt work first time around, he iniably gives it a good whack. It usually starts singing or doing what its supposed to when hes moved on to the next segment. A child will meet their hero...  In this case, Evelyn Cusackwas the star and Johnnys mind was blown. Its always nice when RTE break out the superstars. googletag.cmd.push An audience member in antlers will have too much free wine...  Theyre an excitable bunch, the Toy Show audience. Full of Christmas spirit , there is always one dancing like a tipsy aunt at a wedding - arms waving, beckoning to a mortied friend to join in. Everyone will get sick of the posh kids...  via GIPHY- There will always bedemonstrators suspected of being somebodys kids. Theyll be over confident with too much to say for themselves. They will have notiony names like Evangeline - always! A child will get severe stage fright...  In fairness to young Toby here, he was after singing in front of the nation and then got the stage fright when Girls Aloud had sneaked up on him. Poor fella closed up shop then and Pat went to an ad break in . googletag.cmd.push Well all get jealous of the audience getting a load of stuff...  We love nothing more than when the audience on the Toy Show get shockingly bad prizes like a bar of soap or something. Start dishing out new phones and trips away, and were up in arms! Ryan will call a toy a thinginy bob...  In his usual goofy madcap style, Ryan will utter these words when discussing some newfangled toy. He might give a thinginy bob to the audience. Sales are slow... The presence or absence of the Billie Barry Kids will get a mention...  Once a mainstay, the Billie Barry Stage School are often still missed on the Toy Show. Someone will bring it up and ide opinion with the family member who never really liked them anyway. Someone will say these words: It wasnt as good as other years...  via GIPHY Thats just my opinion. The credits roll and the analysis begins. Bottom line is - it will never be as good as it was when we were kids. But we still love it!

The property also benefits from an integral garage.A key feature of the island is the direct road access to the mainland via Castle Island Road and onto Strangford Road which connects Strangford with Downpatrick.The new owners will share the island with Quoile Yacht Club, which offers some of the finest facilities in Strangford Lough, and the Quoile Pondage Nature Reserve and Bird Hide.The enclosed garden and grounds at the house extend to . acres and slope from the house to Castle Island Road and include manicured lawns and mature trees which provide shelter and amenity. There is also a small gravel area next to the house with trees and shrubs.An extensive block of farmland lies within a perimeter fence and is well suited for the grazing of livestock and production of silage hay.Estate agents Osborne King say that while nestled in private surroundings, the island conveniently lies a short distance from several towns including Downpatrick.While there is an abundance of amenities on the island including wildle, and sporting opportunities, there are also plenty of interest points nearby, including Castle Ward and Delamont Country Park.Gavin Clarke, from Osborne King, says the property has been on the market for over a week and is already generating interest from potential buyers.ldquoThis delightful property would make an ideal second home or, alternatively, a main family residence, given its tranquil location and magnicent views, with the Mournes to one side and Strangford on the other, he said.ldquoThe current owners have lived there for around  years and while they are very sorry to see it go, they look forward to seeing others benefit from it. The bungalow is ready to walk into as it has been well maintained down through the years.Gavin added: ldquoWith a couple of viewings in the pipeline, it would be nice to sell this side of Christmas.Further information is available from the Osborne King office, Donegal Square South, Belfast on    or email property@osborneking..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Businesswoman.jpg","title":"Businesswomen mentor Assumption students  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH students have taken part in their first management programme that promotes womenrsquos capacity for leadership.Over  sixth form girls at Assumption Grammar School spent the day recently shadowing female leaders in a range of industries including financial services, recruitment, law, media, construction and health, last month.SistersIN Female Leadership Programme, was launched this year to help foster girlsrsquo confidence in leadership roles.Organisers say it gave those taking part an opportunity to work alongside a female mentor at CEO, director or partner level across several trades in which women continue to be underrepresented at the top.Projects and communications assistant Hannah Magorrian said: ldquoAfter spending the day with mentors, the students develop their leadership skills in school, leading initiatives including mental health, peer mentoring, photography, sport, music, drama, debating, literacy, creative writing, religion and coding.ldquoThe school hopes these pupil-led initiatives will provide a legacy that benefits the whole school and wider community.ldquoIn line with the ethos at the heart of Assumption Grammar School, the pupils have already spent time with female leaders in local charities.She continued: ldquoThe school is currently working with its sister Assumption schools in South Africa to develop a parallel initiative with the aim of empowering African girls to become future leaders.ldquoThis global aspect of the SistersIN programme is reaching out to a country where females are vastly underrepresented at senior management and executive levels.The SistersIN Female Leadership Programme is being piloted in Assumption Grammar School this year, in association with Women in Business.Pupils will have two further leadership experience days, working with female leaders, on February  and June  when they will gain a dferent experience of leadership from one of over  partner industries..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Celebration.jpg","title":"Celebration time for Aughlisnafin  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN GAC held their annual presentations and dinner in the Burrendale Hotel last Saturday evening with Armagh and Crossmaglen Rangers legend Oisin McConville as the special guest.Major awards were as follows: seniors mdash managerrsquos player of the year, Donagh Steele managerrsquos sportsperson, Sean Fitzsimmons playersrsquo player, Donagh Steele.Minors mdash managerrsquos player, Morgan Croskery managerrsquos sportsperson, Peter OrsquoHare playersrsquo player, Ben Ogle.Senior players Oran Flanagan and Oisin OrsquoToole, received a commemorative league winners shield, on behalf of the squad, which has the names of every player and the management team engraved on it.The senior  and management team were also presented with league and championship medals and the minors were presented with their All County league medals.There were two recipients of the club person of the year award mdash chairperson Sheena Murray in recognition of an outstanding first term in her role and also Gerard Lenaghan in his role as coaching officer and PRO.The final award of the evening was presented to club vice-chairperson and senior player Rory Murphy in recognition of his outstanding contribution over the past  years.Oisin McConville was then invited to say a few words and spoke well with excellent advice for the future and encouraging rank and file members to put their shoulders to the wheel.There is much to do in a growing club and help is vital to sustain the clubrsquos development.

Many from Kilmegan and the surrounding areas tragically paid the ultimate price on a foreign field and are remembered in the book.Chapters on the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the Troubles, the loyalist and IRA ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement take the history of the parish into the modern age.Hundreds of hours of painstaking work researching historical documents and the archives of local newspapers, including those of the Down Recorder, were involved in the production of this book which will undoubtedly be regarded as an important point of reference for current and future generations.In a typically noble and generous gesture the Kilmegan and Maghera Historical Group have decided proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the Childrenrsquos Heartbeat Trust.Copies are now on sale at Walkersrsquo newsagents and JRrsquos Discount Stores, Castlewellan, with details of further points of sale on the Grouprsquos Facebook page, Kilmegan Maghera..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Lecale.jpg","title":"Lecale and Downe Historical Society launches annual publication  ","story":"THE Lecale and Downe Historical Society launched its th annual journal at the Down County Museum last week.Lecale Review No , has proved to be another excellent mix of compelling articles of local interest, published just in time for Christmas.The latest annual charters the history of one of the oldest racecourses in the world outside Downpatrick.The story penned by Joan Magee, lsquoHorse Racing At the Flying Horsersquo tells how a handful of gentry held a horse race around  but little  is known of the occasion.Within  years, the Earl of Ardglass and other noblemen petitioned King James II to set up a Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders within the county.All its members were to be known as Freemen and it had the power to meet in Downpatrick or some other Co Down town every Tuesday of Easter week.As well as having permission to race, the corporation was also permitted to hold a horse fair too.Joan explains that a race transpired at the Flying Horse, Downpatrick, on March ,  and is especially signicant as this race marked the beginning of what is one of the earliest flat racing courses in the world.The winner was Colonel Byerley, who fought at the Battle of the Boyne four months later against the platersquos donor ndash King James II.Another interesting article written by Colm Rooney charts the history of cinema within Downpatrick.Colm reveals that while Belfast had over two dozen cinemas, Downpatrick finally welcomed its first, the Pavilion Picture Theatre in St Patrickrsquos Avenue, at a glitzy opening ceremony on Wednesday June , .It was a huge event for local entrepreneur, Downpatrick man, William Tweedie who watched as locals queued up to pay over one shilling to see the Prisoner of Zenda, the first movie ever shown in the cinema.The cinema later moved to Market Street in the early s with the Breen family taking over the running of the business around , which ran until the s.Another article, Downpatrick by Gaslight, written by Andy Gilmore, reflects on the journey of natural gas over the centuries in Downpatrick.Andy points out that the use of town gas in Ireland dates back to  when gas for lighting streets and homes began to be produced from coal.However, it wasnrsquot until , and a concerted effort by the townsfolk that led to the foundation of a gas company that brought the energy source to Downpatrick.A site on Market Street was agreed for the gasworks in  and it opened later that year.

Mr Nesbitt, who had been under pressure as UUP leader, emerged in a stronger position, having seen his party achieve its best general election result since .By contrast, six months later DUP leader Peter Robinson announced that he was resigning as DUP leader.In that election, Sinn Féin – in a similar electoral position to the DUP, as the dominant party within nationalism – publicly appealed to the SDLP to match unionist unity with nationalist unity.Sinn Féin was in some cases prepared to be explicitly sectarian about the election. Infamously in North Belfast, Sinn Féin candidate Gerry Kelly distributed a leaflet which included a bar chart for the total number of Catholics and Protestants in North Belfast.Taking the total number of those born as Catholics – including even those who were by then atheists or too young to vote – he described them as “a nationalist majority”. At that point, the SDLP resisted Sinn Féin’s calls for a pact. The party’s North Belfast veteran Alban Maginess said bluntly: “We are opposed to these sorts of sectarian headcounts and pacts.” Former SDLP leader Margaret Ritchie similarly said: “We don’t do electoral pacts...the SDLP fights the election – each and every election – on our own mandate and our own basis.”Four and a half years later, all is changed. There has been a degree of unionist unity – although on a smaller scale than in  – but to the surprise of many unionists that has been met with an SDLP–Sinn Féin deal. However, while that process was driven by Sinn Féin which has always been the most enthusiastic proponent of a nationalist pact, the SDLP could emerge from it as the biggest winner. along with the partys Westminster leader Nigel Dodds and candidate for South Belfast Emma Little-Pengelly at the DUPs General Election manesto launch at W in Belfast.

With incumbency on her side, eventhere is not an electoral pact in the next general election, she will be dficult to dislodge.Outside the pact, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is personally taking on Sinn Féin in Foyle and has a real chance of victory against Elisha McCallion, one of Sinn Féin’s weakest candidates.It is highly possible that the SDLP, a party long said to be in terminal decline and with no MPs, could come back with two MPs.If so, at a point when Sinn Féin is facing its own decline in the south and needs to prioritise resources there, the north would suddenly look slightly more vulnerable.Having been forced by internal disquiet to publish the initially secret vote of John O’Dowd’s challenge to northern leader Michelle O’Neill just last week, Sinn Féin is looking less than sure-footed.With rumours of a possible January deal with the DUP toto Stormont, the party could be doing so from a position weaker than republicans would like.try catch  TrendingAll change for Michael Dunlop and TAS Racing in Post-mortem findings revealed after tragic death of -year-old girl in NI riverLarne: Emergency services converge on river in major operationTeenage girldies after going into river in NI town last night -

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He spent hours there every Saturday morning overseeing the mini rugby scene and, as Mr Forde said, everything was done meticulously. “He was the driving force at Chambers Park and his work had a tremendous influence on the lives of so many young people.”Willie had won a host of awards for his rugby work over the years and this was capped last year when he was awarded the British Empire Medal for his work for rugby and the Panthers in particular. Only this year his son, Barry, who paid a moving tribute to his dad, was also awarded the British Empire Medal.Former Portadown Times editor David Armstrong said, “Willie did so much to put mini-rugby on the map.“I worked closely with him when he was pushing to have the game publicised and, as Mr Forde said, he was meticulous in his approach to everything.“I have many happy memories of working with Willie and one of his many qualities was that he never spoke ill of anyone.”Seagoe rector, the Rev Terence Cadden, joined in the tributes and he said the thoughts and prayers of so many people were with Willie’s family – his we, Edna, son Barry, daughter Karen. grandchildrenBrendan, Toby, Poppy, Cassie, Drew. Brett and Mike,brother Lewis and sister, Dea.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth. APCOA Parking Group has almost  years of industry expertise. With its , employees, the company manages approximately . million inidual parking spaces at more than , locations in  European countries.

The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal.
