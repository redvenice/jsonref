Duchess of Sussex arrives for the opening...Share this articlePipe Major Methven, who became only the 15th piper to hold the post when he was appointed in 2015, left straight away.And while the Queen wouldn’t have had it any other way, the downside is that for the first time since 1843 (aside from four years during the Second World War), the monarch has no official bagpipe player. ‘Unfortunately because it happened so unexpectedly no replacement was available, so there has been no piping for the past five weeks,’ the source explained.‘It’s really strange because everyone is just so used to it and for the first few days it was really weird not to hear the sound.          Balmoral: Five weeks without a bagpiper giving the 9am alarm call for 15 minutes‘People can hear the pipes around the estate. It creates a really lovely, evocative atmosphere and sets you up for the day.‘For the Queen, who hears the noise most days, it must seem very odd. She often has her breakfast and reads the papers while the piper is playing.‘It is just part of her normal day and I expect she looks forward to getting a new one but she totally understood Scott’s position. He is incredibly highly regarded by the Royal Household and the Royal Family.’The position of Piper to the Sovereign was established after Queen Victoria discovered that the Marquess of Breadalbane had his own personal piper.  Predecessors: Alexander MacDonald, left, (1945-1966) and Andrew Pitkeathly (1966-1973)Traditionally, the post is held by a serving non-commissioned officer and Pipe Major from a Scottish or Irish Regiment.Of the 15 pipers, 11 have been in the present Queen’s reign, including Alexander MacDonald, who served from 1945 to 1966, and his successor Andrew Pitkeathly, who served until 1973.The piper’s principal duty is to play under the Queen’s window when she is at Buckingham Palace, Windsor, Holyroodhouse or Balmoral, but he also co-ordinates Army pipers who play after state banquets and escorts the Queen to the audiences she has throughout the day.A new piper is now hurriedly being lined up and will, it is hoped, start when the Queen returns to London after her holiday in Scotland.Pipers are personally interviewed by the monarch to see if their personalities will match, as the two interact so regularly. It is said her piper travels with her even more than her husband.Most remain tight-lipped about their posts but Gordon Webster, who held the title in the 1990s, once said: ‘Because the Queen doesn’t like you repeating the same tunes every day I had about 700 stored in my head.’ And Max Stewart, who has also piped for the Queen, said: ‘At Balmoral you have got to try to not repeat a tune the whole trip – which is quite an achievement.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/25/21/4E919DF000000578-0-image-a-5_1532550973907.jpg","title":"Who Julie Swetnick Brett Kavanugh accuser revealed","story":"    Swetnick is the third woman to publicly allege that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconductBut just who is Kavanaugh’s newest accuser, Julie Swetnick?

Applications of this type would be decided by a visa officer in the UK and not in the British Embassy in Moscow.\u0027          The British Embassy is Russia is a grand tower block building on the banks of the River Moskva          But visa applications are initially handled at one of five external centres, including this one in Moscow.

This undated image is alleged to show Chepiga (circled) posing with fellow members of the Russian military  The dark star of Russia\u0027s elite special forces school: Colonel who signed up at 18, was honoured at gaudy memorial to military and then sent to kill Skripal The highly-decorated spy blamed for the Salisbury poisonings was a veteran of Russia\u0027s elite special forces and had trained at one of the country\u0027s top military academies, it emerged last night.The man behind the alias of Boshirov was unmasked by the investigative website as Colonel Chepiga - a GRU intelligence officer bestowed with Russia\u0027s highest state award.His military career began at the age of 18 when he enrolled in a top military school just 25 miles from his tiny home village of Nikolaevka, near the Russia-China border.Col Chepiga studied at the Far Eastern Military Command Academy in Blagoveschensk, an elite training ground for \u0027Spetsnaz\u0027 special forces officers.His name features on a memorial wall at the school under the Gold Star honour list. After graduating from the school with honours in 2001, he was assigned to Russia\u0027s 14th Spetsnaz Brigade, based in the far-eastern city of Khabarovsk.  Dawn Sturgess (left) died after spraying Novichok on her wrists thinking it was a perfume. Her boyfriend, Charlie Rowley, (right) fell critically ill but recoveredSpetsnaz units are responsible for highly-secretive missions and are equivalent to the British SAS.Under the command of the GRU, Russia\u0027s military intelligence agency, his brigade played a vital role in the second Chechen war and was also spotted near the Ukrainian border in late 2014.The information was revealed by investigative website Bellingcat, which had conducted a painstaking investigation into his background.It said that his unit had deployed three times to Chechnya, where Russia was carrying out what it called a \u0027counter-terrorist operation\u0027.The website of a state-run military volunteer organisation claims that Col Chepiga received more than 20 military awards and decorations in the course of his service.And his former military school proudly boasts on its website that he was bestowed his homeland\u0027s highest honour, Hero of the Russian Federation, in 2014. The award is often presented by Vladimir Putin himself.  This map shows the progress of the spies\u0027 assassination plot, as police managed to piece together using CCTV               The two men chose a hotel in east London, 127 miles from Salisbury, despite heading to the city twice in three daysWhile the achievements of his fellow award-winners are detailed extensively, Col Chepiga\u0027s simply says it was awarded \u0027by decree from the Russian president\u0027. Bellingcat speculated that he could have been given the award for operations in Eastern Ukraine – where Russia\u0027s military was secretly operating in 2014.Senior Russian military officials have since said that so-called \u0027little green men\u0027 – soldiers wearing uniforms with no insignia – were in fact members of Russia\u0027s Spetsnaz deployed secretly to Ukraine. The Bellingcat website also found an undated photograph of graduates from the Far Eastern Military Command Academy on assignment in Chechnya.It pointed out that the man on the far right looks strikingly similar to the man named as Boshirov by the Metropolitan Police – although it said it could not prove conclusively it was the same person.They came across the photograph after sources said the school was a likely place for a Russian military officer with a specialism in Western European operations to have trained.

Both were critically ill after the Novichok attack in SalisburyAfter further digging, they came across the mysterious Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga. Address databases link him to the Military Unit 20662 – code for the 14th Spetsnaz Brigade.The logo of the brigade is a black bat with a yellow parachute behind it. It was formed in the 1960s and has been under the command of the GRU for much of its history. According to Yuri Shvets, a former KGB agent, GRU officers were referred to as \u0027boots\u0027 – tough but unsophisticated.Once a member of the GRU, it is believed to be exceptionally difficult to leave. And those who do so to join foreign agencies are punished savagely.Viktor Suvorov, a GRU officer who defected to Britain in 1978, said new recruits were shown a video of a traitor from the agency being burned alive in a furnace as a warning. The GRU has become adept as using so-called \u0027non-linear warfare\u0027, which uses a combination of covert special forces operations, spying, cyber attacks and internet trolls to destabilise enemy nations.It started as an intelligence-gathering agency for Trotsky\u0027s Bolshevik Red Army, and Lenin insisted it remain separate from the other intelligence organisations.Today it still sits apart from the SVR, the external spying service, and the domestic FSB (the equivalents of Britain\u0027s MI6 and MI5), which were created when the notorious KGB was split in 1991.  How will the West react to proof Putin lied?Commentary by Owen Matthews THIS sensational revelation – the seniority of the would-be assassin and the official state support for the mission – shows that the Skripal hit must have been ordered at the very highest levels of the Russian state.The evidence that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the attack grows stronger every day.Indeed, by presiding over one of the most farcically inept cover-ups in memory – when the two Russians caught on CCTV here claimed to have been tourists visiting Salisbury cathedral – Putin has condemned himself out of his own mouth.Days after British police released dozens of security camera images of the pair on their way from Moscow to Salisbury, Putin appeared on Russian television to defend them as \u0027innocent Russian citizens about whom we know nothing\u0027. His fingerprints were all over the operation.The following afternoon, \u0027Petrov\u0027 and \u0027Boshirov\u0027 themselves appeared to air a cock-and-bull story about being turned back from their mission to see Salisbury by slush – two days in a row.          Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the two suspects were just civilians and not members of the GRUBefore the denials by Putin and by the suspects themselves, it might have been possible to argue plausibly that the botched assassination attempt was some kind of rogue operation by Russia\u0027s secret services.But Putin\u0027s personal defence of the suspects and the inept cover-up job by the state-controlled media constitute strong, if wholly unintended, proof of the Kremlin\u0027s deep complicity.And now the Bellingcat revelations have added incontrovertible layers of detail to the emerging picture of a top-level GRU assassination squad operating on UK soil.Using mostly open-source data, Bellingcat\u0027s researchers first unearthed details of the passports the suspects used to enter the UK, published by British police.Petrov and Boshirov\u0027s passport numbers, it turned out, varied by just a single digit – and were issued by a Moscow office used exclusively for officials\u0027 travel documents. Even more suspiciously, Boshirov\u0027s passport file was stamped \u0027Do not reveal information\u0027.Then, yesterday, came the clincher. By trawling through the records of GRU academy graduation classes, Bellingcat matched the photos of \u0027Boshirov\u0027 to the real-life Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga. Once they had a name, details of Colonel Chepiga\u0027s secret service popped up all over the internet, in online posts by veterans\u0027 groups and even written in letters of gold on a stone monument to the decorated graduates of one of the GRU\u0027s secret intelligence academies.Chepiga served in Chechnya with the Spetznaz, the elite forces of the Federal Security Service, where by some reports he received 20 awards and decorations.In short, Putin has been caught out telling analogue lies in a digital world.          Counter-terrorism police released images of two suspects in connection with the Salisbury attack and named them as Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov (circled right)Bellingcat became famous for its painstaking investigation into the downing of a Malaysian Airlines Boeing over Eastern Ukraine in July 2014, collecting photos from social media and intelligence data showing the hour-by-hour progress of the Buk missile system which downed the plane, from a military base inside Russia into Eastern Ukraine and back again.Russia\u0027s vehement denials of involvement were shown to be false. Now, with Bellingcat\u0027s dozens of detailed revelations about the true identity of one of the would-be Skripal assassins, another of the Kremlin\u0027s brazen lies has been carefully picked apart.Perhaps the most terrifying part of the whole tragic story of the Skripal poisoning, which resulted in the death of an innocent British bystander, is the shocking combination of the Kremlin\u0027s deadly intent and utter incompetence.Instead of quietly disposing of a \u0027traitor\u0027, Chepiga and his as-yet-unnamed accomplice succeeded in contaminating parts of Salisbury, murdering an innocent woman, and revealing themselves to the whole world as bungling idiots.Attempting extra-judicial execution on British soil is bad enough. But to spread deadly nerve agent around a cathedral city is irresponsible bungling on an epic scale.The question now, of course, is what the response of the West will be to this damning revelation.Will Theresa May call for renewed sanctions? Will America ratchet up their rhetoric? We shall have to wait and see in the coming days.What is clear is that the Kremlin and its henchmen have been revealed for what they are – not just a bunch murderous liars, but terrible at both.bellingcat - Skripal Suspect Boshirov Identified as GRU Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga - bellingcat"},{"url":null,"title":"Sean Connery saved world times character say researchers","story":"    British icon Sean Connery (above with Lana Wood in Diamonds Are Forever ) has saved the planet more than any other actor in a movie according to new research my Movies4Men          Connery came to stardom in his  role as secret agent James Bond in the 1962 hit Dr No. His 13 rescue acts put him three ahead of Bruce Willis and four ahead of Keanu ReevesJames Bond star Sean Connery, 87, looks frail as he supports...Sean Connery takes a stroll around NYC with his wife...Share this articleThe research also found Harrison Ford and Will Smith came in at fourth and fifth when it came to rescue acts in a movie with a joint score of seven.However, Connery\u0027s life was not always one connected with superheroes and villains.Before finding stardom, Connery had many different jobs including a milkman, lorry driver and bodybuilder.He even had a shot at playing as a professional football player before choosing to pursue acting.

But he then began to ask me questions about my husband asking how I satisfy him and what would I do if he was feeling sexual.\u0027Dr Ihsan then asked me how I would pleasure my husband and I responded by saying manually. I felt uncomfortable and I tried to get back on to my symptoms rather than answering his questions.\u0027          A medical tribunal heard he asked one woman to have sex with him on his desk while other patients waited in the next room to see himThe woman said Ihsan became more \u0027explicit and irrelevant\u0027 and asked her about her orgasms. She later reported the matter to the health centre.The second woman saw the doctor for a review about her contraception and he told her: \u0027I can tell you are in a good place - you look good.\u0027In her statement, the second complainant said: \u0027Dr Ihsan then moved his chair towards to me and said \u0027I\u0027m horny me\u0027.Is your GP surgery at risk of closure?

He said I was beautiful and I had soft skin. He then touched my right cheek with his left hand.\u0027She reminded him he had patients waiting outside, but he replied: I can lock the door if you want me to. He added: I can tell you look after yourself by looking at your nails. I want to show you something, I want you to see my balls - I really, really want you to see my balls. He then offered to clear his desk and have sex on it.\u0027Last November Ihsan who admitted ten charges but denied 21 others was found guilty of sexually motivated misconduct towards the second woman but a disciplinary panel found his conduct towards the first complainant was not sexually motivated.           Two complaints were made while Dr Ihsan was working as a locum at the Church View Health Centre in South Kirkby near WakefieldAt the time his mentor - a senior doctor - wrote a testimonial on his behalf saying: \u0027I believe that Dr lhsan is showing insight about the seriousness of the case, and has the ability to reflect on what has happened and to behave differently if such a case arises in future.\u0027The latest incident took place in April 2017 after Ihsan moved to Kings Lynn, Norfolk to take up a job at Queen Elisabeth Hospital. He exposed himself to the housekeeper whilst she was retrieving cleaning items from her trolley.The woman claimed he locked the door to the flat then pushed into her a corner before dropping his towel and grabbing her bottom. She said she managed to break free when her mobile phone rang and she unlocked the door before escaping.Ihsan admitted being wearing nothing but a towel in front of the housekeeper but was cleared of making sexual advances towards her.He denied being a \u0027serial abuser\u0027 and claimed a \u0027good and useful doctor who got on well with patients and colleagues.\u0027Of the incident with the housekeeper he told the hearing: \u0027I told her I needed to go out and asked if she would mind if I had a shower... I asked about a shower in part to gauge her reaction.\u0027In making the tribunal\u0027s ruling panel chairman Jane Wheat said: \u0027The Tribunal had regard to the additional information about Dr Ihsan\u0027s previous GMC history, in particular, the previous finding of sexually motivated conduct.\u0027It concluded that having had two adverse findings of sexually motivated conduct, on two occasions less than a year apart, demonstrated Dr Ihsan\u0027s lack of appreciation of sexual boundaries.

It was around 20 years ago so she\u0027ll be an adult now.\u0027Ms Yasutake was unknown in the town. Police took her photograph around shops and homes near the house where the grim discovery was made, but they received little information about her.          Forensics officers searched the front garden of a cottage where a body was discoveredWhen the family first moved in it was thought they had a child living with them, but few people were aware there was a fourth adult in the house.Alec Foots, who works at a local garage where the family would do their weekly shop, said: \u0027The police showed me the picture of the woman who died and I\u0027ve never seen her before.\u0027It came as a surprise that she had been living there, I don\u0027t know of anyone who\u0027s seen her.

Now, more than 53 years later, Schatzberg is releasing a book titled Dylan By Schatzberg that showcases a comprehensive collection of both photos and countless stories. Dylan is pictured above posing inside of Schatzberg photography studio in 1965          For more than six decades,  Schatzberg has used his camera lens to capture dozens of A-listers, artists, politicians and elite musicians. Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Andy Warhol, Sammy Davis Jr., Duke of Windsor (the abdicated King Edward VIII) and Ted Kennedy have all posed for him. But of all the high-profile iniduals the 91-year-old photographer has interacted with,  Dylan was his best photographic subject. As Schatzberg says: \u0027You just point the camera at him and things happen.\u0027 The singer is pictured above in a photo while smoking a cigarette in 1965          Schatzberg shared that the pair became fast friends and would often hang out together along with other musicians at restaurants or night clubs. The photographer remarked that people have often asked if the out-of-focus image on the cover of Blonde on Blonde represented a drug trip. It doesn\u0027t. They were just really, really cold. \u0027It was something that actually is an honest image. He was cold and I was shaking, I was cold and the camera was shaking,\u0027 he said. Pictured above is another image taken of Dylan from the same shoot for the Blonde on Blonde cover in the Meat Packing District of Manhattan Schatzberg was so moved that he asked a mutual friend if the musician would agree to being photographed. The next day he was surprised to receive a phone call from Dylan\u0027s then-wife, Sara Dylan. Her husband had agreed. \u0027I showed up the next day and he was great,\u0027 Schatzberg said of his initial encounter with Dylan in a recording studio in 1965. \u0027Immediately he wanted me to hear something that he had just recorded. I was a little intimidated, but it was great.\u0027Schatzberg explained that after showing him the first set of photos he captured with his Nikon camera  that Dylan liked them and agreed to being photographed more by Schatzberg, who was then aged 38 and had already shot covers for Vogue, Life, Esquire and Glamour.\u0027The first set of pictures were done in the studio pretty much under his control. …He would feel at home in the recording studio where he knows everything that\u0027s going on. And so I asked him to come to my studio and he said yeah,\u0027 Schatzberg said.\u0027I didn\u0027t tell him that I wanted him to come to my studio because I have more control there. I wanted to be the boss. \u0027After we got to know each other, we had no problem at all, anything I suggested he took in his mind and we built a good relationship. He was just like anybody else. He was very funny and he\u0027s a very special talent.\u0027          Schatzberg, pictured above at home in his apartment with his new book, remarked: \u0027After we got to know each other, we had no problem at all, anything I suggested he took in his mind and we built a good relationship.

When Dylan showcased a few new songs from his album Highway 61 Revisited while performing on August 28, 1965, he was booed. \u0027He said \u0027f*** \u0027em, I don\u0027t care\u0027 in response to being booed.

It was the beginning of February 1966, so it was very cold and he was wearing a light jacket,\u0027 he recalled of the chilly weather, which can be as low as 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-6 Celsius). \u0027So I asked him if he would go outside because I didn\u0027t like the shots I was getting into the studio. It was okay, but it wasn\u0027t something special. So he said yeah and had on a little jacket.          Of Dylan, Schatzberg said: \u0027I think of him as one of my greatest subject matters and I protect that a lot. I still do today, I just won\u0027t give my pictures to everybody or sell them to everybody.\u0027 Dylan is pictured above holding a picture frame as prop inside Schatzberg\u0027s photography studio in the mid-1960s          Schatzberg said, \u0027He\u0027s just got something to him and I felt working with him and knowing him, I was able to get into his soul and get deeper into him and a lot of my photographs I look at them and I find them amazing.\u0027 The Blowing in the Wind singer is pictured above looking deeply into the camera in another image captured by Schatzberg inside his studio           Schatzberg said that Dylan is \u0027a very special talent\u0027 and the images that are included of him in his new book showcase that. The Like a Rolling Stone singer is pictured above releasing cigarette smoke in a striking image that Schatzberg captured in the mid-1960s  Schatzberg\u0027s book also reveals a several stories about his experiences with Dylan during the 1960s while showcasing dozens of images that coincide with those stories.

Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island held up a blowup of the calendar – and noted that a Thursday July 1, 1982 entry contained the names of three people Ford said were present during the small gathering where she alleges Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her and covered her mouth in an upstairs bedroom.That was the calendar date Kavanaugh was questioned about by a Republican-hired prosecutor – who was not heard from again after the exchange in Thursday\u0027s televised hearing. Ford testified that Kavanaugh, his friend Mark Judge, and P.J. Smyth all were present during the alleged assault. Judge and Smyth have said in statements they don\u0027t recall any party like the one Ford is referring to.New questions over who leaked Christine Ford\u0027s explosive...Brett Kavanaugh WILL be probed by FBI over sex attack claims...Share this article    Sen. Charles Grasslely said it was \u0027the wrong gathering,\u0027 because a total of seven boys attended, not four as Ford initially statedHe continued: \u0027This may – may – be powerful corroborating evidence that the assault happened. That it happened that day. And that it happened in that place. But with no FBI investigation, we can\u0027t tell. ... It\u0027s the least thing a sexual assault victim is entitled to when she comes forward. The FBI could interview all the attendees, not just to obtain simple denials but to cross check and see if the stories add up. The FBI could see if the house matches the locality and description Dr. Ford gave. The FBI could inquire after and pursue other corroborating or exculpatory evidence. It\u0027s what they do,\u0027 Whitehouse said.During Thursday\u0027s hearing prosecutor Rachel Mitchell questioned Kavanaugh about the entry about the party.          Kavanaugh furnished his calendars and argued they showed he was out of town most weekends when the alleged assault occurred          \u0027Anybody who has done any serious investigation knows you don\u0027t stop just with witness statements of interested parties,\u0027 said Whitehouse, a former prosecutor\u0027The entry says, and I quote, go to ‘Timmy’s for skis with Judge, Tom, P.J. Bernie and ... Squi?’ she said, as the Washington Post reported. \u0027Squi. It’s a nickname,\u0027 Kavanaugh responded. \u0027To what does this refer, and to whom?\u0027 Mitchell asked. \u0027It looks like we went over to Timmy’s. You want to know their last names, too? I’m happy to do it,\u0027 Kavanaugh said.\u0027If you could just identify: Is ‘Judge’ Mark Judge?\u0027 Mitchell responded.\u0027It is. It’s Tim Gaudette, Mark Judge, Tom Kaine, P.J. Smyth, Bernie McCarthy, Chris Garrett,\u0027 Kavanaugh said.Kavanaugh denies committing the alleged assault or anything like it in high school or any other time. Judge and Smyth were the people identified by Ford as being at the party where she alleges she was attacked.  She amended her comment Thursday to say there may have been a few other people.Ford also said under questioning that she went out with a person who appears to be Squi, though she didn\u0027t say his name at that time. \u0027He was somebody that, I will use the phrase ‘I went out with,’  Ford said. “I wouldn’t say ‘date.’ I would say ‘went out with’ for a few months. That was how we termed it at the time.”Ford described the person she dated as her connection to Kavanaugh. Panel chair Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa was armed with a response to Whitehouse\u0027s statement about the calendar.He said it showed there were at least seven boys at the party.   \u0027I think I should try to clarify about the calendar that senator Whitehouse put up there. The entry has six boys listed for July 1st, 1982,\u0027 says Grassley.  \u0027It says go to Timmy\u0027s house for skis with judge, Tom, P.J., Bernie, and Squi. Dr. Ford said there were four boys there, the calendar entry lists six plus Kavanaugh. That\u0027s seven. That\u0027s the wrong gathering,\u0027 Grassley said.Following a last-minute compromise prompted by Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, the FBI may get a one week period to investigate Ford\u0027s allegations. They now have a list of people that could be interviewed and a possible date and location to try to investigate the allegations. Whitehouse used the calendar issue to call for more investigation. \u0027Anybody who has done any serious investigation knows you don\u0027t stop just with witness statements of interested parties. You run down corroborating and impeaching evidence. You check and cross check. You ask and go back again.

Now after her death last year aged 91 he has been told he will be getting his hands on £139,000.Last night Marney, who was not among mourners at Mrs Perott’s funeral, told the Mail that he planned to celebrate by taking his wife on holiday to Benidorm for a month.The gardener, who denies any wrongdoing, said: ‘I had a lot of trouble after all the argy-bargy. I was a year under investigation for this – £200,000 taken from an old lady, 88-year-old with dementia, and I ain’t been charged and nicked for it. I ain’t done anything wrong. That’s why I’m not in prison, innit? I didn’t go to the funeral – I was told to stay away.’Marney added: ‘I got a letter three or four months ago – I was told I was going to get £139,000. When I finally get the money I’m going to put it in my pocket then take my wife on holiday for a month to Benidorm.’He said a solicitor appointed to protect Mrs Perott’s interests had negotiated with him over the £325,000 will. Disabled man, 40, is found GUILTY of assaulting two old...Pictured: Disabled man, 40, who \u0027used mobility scooter to...Share this articleHe agreed to increase the widow’s bequests to her church and a monastery in return for being allowed to get £139,000 himself without threat of a legal challenge.Last night a spokesmen for the Court of Protection and the Official Solicitor refused to explain why the discredited gardener had been allowed to benefit so handsomely.Childless Mrs Perott had worked for the BBC World Service for decades. She married Mstislav Perott, whose parents had fled Russia after the 1917 revolution, and became an active volunteer in the Russian Orthodox Church in the UK.After Mr Perott died 20 years ago, she at first remained living in the large marital house in Barons Court, West London.But in 2005 she sold the house – now worth £2million – for £425,000, and moved 20 miles to a council estate in St Mary Cray, South East London, where she had no friends or family.          Former BBC World Service secretary Daphne Perott, who hired Marney to mow her tiny lawn in South East London in 2006A judge investigating her case said there was a suggestion that ‘she may have been the victim of financial abuse’ over the move. Once in St Mary Cray, she descended into dementia. In 2006 she hired Marney, from Crayford, to look after the miniature garden behind her cramped former council house.Exactly how much control he had over her finances only became clear in 2014 when social workers raised concerns and a special hearing took place at the secretive Court of Protection in London. Judge Denzil Lush found that as the woman’s condition worsened, she gave Marney power of attorney in 2011. It was not long before he paid himself a gift of £38,000 out of her account, drew a bankers draft for £1,500, and used her cash card to take out £8,500 he could not account for.After she was taken into a care home in 2012, he promptly sold her house for £165,000 – and paid the lot into a bank account in his own name. He also used the vulnerable woman’s money to get his wife Susan, 71, a new Nissan Qashqai car.Judge Lush stripped him of the power of attorney. The £165,000 was frozen. Marney, who claimed the £165,000 was to pay Mrs Perott’s care home fees, was not charged with any offence and was still due to receive 80 per cent of her estate.Out of her total estate of £325,000, £60,000 goes to the Russian Orthodox Church and £60,000 to a monastery. Russian Orthodox cathedral administrator Vera McClenaghan last night said she was astonished Marney was getting so much from the will, adding: ‘He tried to take over her house and money.’A spokesman for the Official Solicitor refused to comment on the case, but said it was ready to intervene when any of the 2.6million people with powers of attorney were reported to be abusing their power. "},{"url":null,"title":"Amal Clooney begs Myanmars Aung San Suu Kyi release journalists reported Rohingya massacre","story":"    International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney speaks during a conference called Press Behind Bars: Undermining Justice and Democracy          Barrister Amal Clooney pleaded with Myanmar\u0027s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi to realse two Reuters journalists held by her government          Thhe speech at the UN event in New York to make the case the men should be pardoned          Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen Adler alongside Mrs Clooney.

Duchess of Sussex arrives for the opening...Share this articlePipe Major Methven, who became only the 15th piper to hold the post when he was appointed in 2015, left straight away.And while the Queen wouldn’t have had it any other way, the downside is that for the first time since 1843 (aside from four years during the Second World War), the monarch has no official bagpipe player. ‘Unfortunately because it happened so unexpectedly no replacement was available, so there has been no piping for the past five weeks,’ the source explained.‘It’s really strange because everyone is just so used to it and for the first few days it was really weird not to hear the sound.          Balmoral: Five weeks without a bagpiper giving the 9am alarm call for 15 minutes‘People can hear the pipes around the estate. It creates a really lovely, evocative atmosphere and sets you up for the day.‘For the Queen, who hears the noise most days, it must seem very odd. She often has her breakfast and reads the papers while the piper is playing.‘It is just part of her normal day and I expect she looks forward to getting a new one but she totally understood Scott’s position. He is incredibly highly regarded by the Royal Household and the Royal Family.’The position of Piper to the Sovereign was established after Queen Victoria discovered that the Marquess of Breadalbane had his own personal piper.  Predecessors: Alexander MacDonald, left, (1945-1966) and Andrew Pitkeathly (1966-1973)Traditionally, the post is held by a serving non-commissioned officer and Pipe Major from a Scottish or Irish Regiment.Of the 15 pipers, 11 have been in the present Queen’s reign, including Alexander MacDonald, who served from 1945 to 1966, and his successor Andrew Pitkeathly, who served until 1973.The piper’s principal duty is to play under the Queen’s window when she is at Buckingham Palace, Windsor, Holyroodhouse or Balmoral, but he also co-ordinates Army pipers who play after state banquets and escorts the Queen to the audiences she has throughout the day.A new piper is now hurriedly being lined up and will, it is hoped, start when the Queen returns to London after her holiday in Scotland.Pipers are personally interviewed by the monarch to see if their personalities will match, as the two interact so regularly. It is said her piper travels with her even more than her husband.Most remain tight-lipped about their posts but Gordon Webster, who held the title in the 1990s, once said: ‘Because the Queen doesn’t like you repeating the same tunes every day I had about 700 stored in my head.’ And Max Stewart, who has also piped for the Queen, said: ‘At Balmoral you have got to try to not repeat a tune the whole trip – which is quite an achievement.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/21/4FD8ED0200000578-0-image-a-67_1536351806576.jpg","title":"Princes former chef half sister open performer final days","story":"    Family and a former employee of Prince have opened up about their growing concerns for the musical sensation, leading up to his death in 2016.

Fine dining: The Brexit banquet venue Bertie’s Crystal Ballroom in Halifax  According to the whistleblower, Mr Bashir spent a third of his 2017 expenses on the lavish dinner for 200 people (pictured: receipts from the night) It is not the first time Pakistani-born businessman Mr Bashir has been caught up in controversy. He faced questions over his expenses when he defected from UKIP to the Tories in 2015. He claimed it was a ‘smear’ and has consistently denied any wrongdoing.MEPs currently receive £47,100 a year (52,992 euros) in expenses, known as the General Expenditure Allowance (GEA). The flat-rate sum can be paid directly into their personal bank account and is meant to cover constituency costs such as office rent, phones, computers, conferences and exhibitions, hotel and restaurant bills, and travel.The spending must be ‘directly linked to the exercise of their Parliamentary mandate’. Receipts are not required by Brussels, leading to claims it is open to abuse.According to the whistleblower, Mr Bashir spent a third of his 2017 expenses on the lavish dinner for 200 people, mainly Tory supporters and friends, at Bertie’s Banqueting Rooms in Elland, West Yorkshire last October. The glittering free event, entitled ‘Global Britain – Out Of The EU Into The World’, was not widely advertised to his constituents.Mr Bashir made a speech about Brexit and Mr McLoughlin showered praise on him. A well-placed source said: ‘The event had little to do with promoting the interests of Mr Bashir’s constituency. Nearly everyone there was a Tory or friend of Mr Bashir. It was primarily a social event to promote him and his political ambitions.’          Pieter Cleppe, head of the Open Europe think tank, said the case illustrates that the European Parliament’s expenses system is extremely vulnerable to waste and abuseMr Bashir’s GEA expenses bank account statement – details of which have been made known to the Mail – shows he made a series of payments for the Bertie’s function staggered over several months.He paid £4,000 to hire the venue, £8,800 for the meal, and £2,000 for drinks to Eden Fine Wines.No expense was spared to use the event to boost Mr Bashir’s image – he also paid £295 from expenses to hire a professional photographer.The high cost of the Bertie’s bash sent Mr Bashir’s GEA account into the red. Embarrassingly, a £139 direct debit payment bounced on December 13 as he struggled to settle his Bertie’s bill.In September 2017, Mr Bashir used his GEA account to pay the £500 bill for a table of ten guests at a dinner to raise funds for a Pakistan-linked charity, the Kashmir Education Foundation-UK.Zouk was the venue for a curry night hosted by the MEP at last year’s Tory conference where Cabinet high-flyer Mr Javid was present. A bill for £298 for Kingfisher beer for the function was paid from Mr Bashir’s expenses.The whistleblower claimed the Audi A6 is used mainly by Mr Bashir’s sons Mudassar and Tayeb and the GEA account was used to pay parking fines. Mr Bashir said last night: ‘I have nothing to answer for. I work very hard and do a job for my constituents. This is gutter politics.’Later, he said in a statement: ‘My expenses have been thoroughly scrutinised and approved as within the European Parliament’s regulations.‘Any events involving meals or drinks were entirely legitimate exercises in raising awareness about the EU and my role as an MEP.’ He defended his decision to use his MEP’s expenses to open a new office in Halifax last year and confirmed the office had closed. He said he ‘hoped to re-establish an office there’. Mr Bashir insisted he was the ‘chief user’ of the Audi A6 and did not claim any mileage allowance. He added: ‘If any parking fine has been misclaimed by my office it will be repaid.’ Pieter Cleppe, head of the Open Europe think tank, said: ‘Regardless of whether or not rules have been broken in this case, it illustrates that the European Parliament’s expenses system is extremely vulnerable to waste and abuse. \u0027It has been plagued by scandals and is in dire need of reform. It’s hard to argue that taxpayers should be paying for all of this and shameful that they refuse to tighten up the rules.’A European Parliament spokesman said: ‘We do not hold records of MEPs’ expenses and do not comment on inidual cases. \u0027The GEA is intended to cover expenditure such as office costs, phones, postage and the purchase, operation and maintenance of computers.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"New blow Unilevers plans Britain Holland","story":"    Unilever\u0027s plot to scrap its UK headquarters has suffered a fresh setback after another major investor came out against it (stock image)Consumer goods titan Unilever wants to axe its legal HQ in Britain and base the company solely in the Netherlands.

And I\u0027m not alone. Making this radio programme, I met a number of my contemporaries and found that we had very similar stocks of stored memories.Michael Rosen (poet and former Children\u0027s Laureate) and I overlapped at university and, 50 years on, found ourselves able to recite, in unison, Shelley\u0027s Ozymandias — or at least the beginning of it:\u0027I met a traveller from an antique land,Who said — \u0027Two vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert . . .\u0027I began my research with the Duchess of Cornwall. She has recently taken over from the Queen as patron of the Royal Society of Literature and kindly invited me for tea at Clarence House.She\u0027s easy company: chatty, forthcoming, unselfconscious, unpretentious, an enthusiastic reader, with a real passion for poetry.Her taste in poetry isn\u0027t as conventional as I had expected. She knew Ted Hughes and he read some of his poetry to her children.One of her favourite poems is The Christmas Truce by the Poet Laureate, Carol Ann Duffy. \u0027It moved me to tears,\u0027 she told me.Was poetry part of her childhood? I asked. \u0027Very much so,\u0027 she said. \u0027My mother loved poetry. Her favourite was Right Royal by John Masefield.\u0027 It\u0027s a narrative poem that tells the story of a steeplechase, the winning horse and the jockey\u0027s relationship with his beloved which is placed in jeopardy by the race — all rather apt, I suggested, given the Duchess\u0027s love of horses and her own royal story.  Poetry was very much a part of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall\u0027s childhoodShe laughed and agreed.\u0027At school, I had a Scottish teacher who got me into Burns.\u0027My heart\u0027s in the Highlands,my heart\u0027s not here …\u0027\u0027And a wonderful teacher who read to us from Chaucer\u0027s Canterbury Tales.\u0027Her favourites from her schooldays include Christina Rossetti, Walter de la Mare, John Betjeman (of course), but not Byron.\u0027But I love the poetry of Oscar Wilde. I still read Wilde.\u0027The poems that have stayed with the Duchess are \u0027the poems with rhyme and rhythm\u0027.Leaning forward towards the microphone, brow slightly furrowed, she launched into W H Auden\u0027s Night Mail:\u0027This is the night mail crossingthe Border,Bringing the cheque and thepostal order,Letters for the rich, letters forthe poor,The shop at the corner, the girlnext door …\u0027Can she remember the first poem she learned as a girl? \u0027Oh yes, definitely, Matilda\u0027 — one of Hilaire Belloc\u0027s Cautionary Tales designed \u0027for the Admonition of Children between the ages of eight and 14\u0027.\u0027Matilda told such Dreadful Lies, It made one Gasp and Stretch one\u0027s Eyes\u0027 . . . I think I was made to learn it because of some fib I\u0027d told. I can still remember most of it.\u0027I put the Duchess to the test and she managed a good few lines, without resorting to the copy of Belloc she\u0027d brought with her.\u0027It\u0027s not so easy when you\u0027re under pressure. I knew it all last night,\u0027 she told me.\u0027It\u0027s much easier for you because you\u0027re an actor.\u0027Only now and then but I do know someone who is indisputably the real thing, so leaving the Duchess (more of whom later), I went on to see Dame Judi Dench.I found her in her country garden, enjoying the late summer sunshine, sitting with a friend who was helping her learn her lines for her next screen role.She was in a happy mood and, though it was only mid-morning, generously offered me champagne (which I declined) and an avocado (which I accepted: I am on a low-carb diet).What was the first poetry Dame Judi had learned by heart? Was it A A Milne? Or Hilaire Belloc? Or Edward Lear?\u0027Oh, no. It was Shakespeare. Even when I was very little, I knew lots and lots of Shakespeare.\u0027I don\u0027t know if I understood much of it, but I loved it.\u0027I learnt lots of Shakespeare when I was a girl: the plays, the sonnets. I can give you lots of sonnets — and I can do all of Twelfth Night and all of A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream, every word, I promise you.\u0027I believe her. Her love of Shakespeare is palpable. \u0027My sight\u0027s going now,\u0027 she said. \u0027If we had to go on stage now and read a sonnet, you\u0027d have it written on just one page, but for me the print would be so big I\u0027d need 14 pages.\u0027 She laughs, but she\u0027s not joking.\u0027Now I learn my lines with my friend, Pen. She reads me the lines and I repeat them. I can\u0027t drive any more and I find that difficult, but I manage. But I couldn\u0027t live without Shakespeare.\u0027Dame Judi has reams of poetry in her head and, like the Duchess, agrees that it\u0027s the stuff with rhythm and rhyme that\u0027s easiest to remember.\u0027Shakespeare\u0027s verse goes with the beat of your heart,\u0027 she says —and she\u0027s right.Which brings us to the science — and the important bit.In the Memory Laboratory at Cambridge University\u0027s Department for Neuroscience in Education, I found Professor Usha Goswami. With an Indian father and German mother, and clearly a bit of genius herself, she\u0027s doing extraordinary work that one day may help find a cure for dyslexia.Her research provides measurable proof of what my gut instinct has long told me: as you start out in life, having your parents recite poetry and sing songs to you will help you with your linguistic skills as you grow older, learning poetry will, without question, keep dementia at bay.You will find the detail in her learned paper, A Neural Basis For Phonological Awareness? An Oscillatory Temporal Sampling Perspective, published by the Association of Psychological Science.Professor Goswami has been studying what goes on inside the brains of babies and young children — measuring the neural oscillations (the brainwaves as it were) that encode the signals through which we begin to learn and understand speech.The metrical structures and rhythmic patterns of nursery rhymes coincide with the brain\u0027s neural oscillations — starting with a trochaic rhythm (as in the beat of \u0027The cat sat on the mat\u0027) and quickly going on to the rhythm of the iambic pentameter (as in Shakespeare\u0027s verse) which explains why Dame Judi Dench could quite easily have been spouting Shakespeare from the age of three or four.The professor and her team can measure the speech-sound awareness of babies, toddlers and young children and, on the basis of the data, accurately predict speech, reading and (wait for it!) even spelling development. Never mind the scientific gobbledygook, what the professor\u0027s studies establish is that the more you recite poetry to your children — before they are born as well — the better they will be able to communicate, both when it comes to spoken and, later, even when it comes to written language. It\u0027s amazing stuff.Why do we remember best the poems we learnt as children, I asked the professor?\u0027First in, last out, is the principle of it,\u0027 she explained. And why is the stuff we\u0027ve learned later more difficult to recall?\u0027It\u0027s all still in there,\u0027 she said, reassuringly. \u0027It\u0027s just sometimes difficult to retrieve because there is so much in there.\u0027The brain is a computer into which we are loading more and more stuff as the years go by. Those \u0027senior moments\u0027 occur not because we have lost anything but because it has been temporarily mislaid. It\u0027s a retrieval issue, not a memory one. Concentration should be able to bring it back.\u0027At whatever age you are,\u0027 according to the professor, \u0027you still have the capacity to learn new things if you put your mind to it. There\u0027s no shortage of brain cells as you grow older.\u0027Recent research from the department of neurobiology at Columbia University has established that new brain cells grow as quickly when you are in your 70s as when you are in your 20s.According to the scientists at Columbia, gradual mental decline \u0027is not the inevitable process many of us think it is\u0027.They found this after counting the number of new cells growing in the hippocampus — the part of the brain that processes memories and emotions. They found that around 700 brain cells were created each day even in the oldest people they studied, and that there was no difference in the hippocampus in young and old brains.Back at Cambridge University, Professor Goswami is unequivocal: learning poetry by heart is good for the brain.\u0027You\u0027ve got the keep the brain active. The exercise and discipline of learning a poem by heart is certainly going to help keep dementia at bay,\u0027 she says.Did you hear that? There is no excuse. If you want to do it, you can. The great actress Dame Sybil Thorndike lived into her 90s and made herself learn a new poem every day of her life to keep her brain active.Dame Judi Dench, 83, is learning hers for her next film. Dame Maggie Smith, 83, has just learnt hers for the Downton Abbey film she\u0027s currently making. And my friend Nicholas Parsons, 95 next month, is not only as razor-sharp as ever on Radio 4\u0027s Just A Minute, he is also touring with a one-man show about Edward Lear in which he recites poem after poem after poem after poem — and doesn\u0027t hesitate once.Learning poetry by heart will make you a better parent and give you a longer, mentally-active life. Fact.The Duchess of Cornwall agrees.\u0027Of course, it\u0027s good for you — it\u0027s good for everyone. It helps ward off dementia and that\u0027s wonderful.\u0027It helps young children with their language skills and that\u0027s wonderful, too.\u0027According to everyone I met making my radio programme, the poems that are easiest to learn are ones with a strong rhythm — and ones you have a feeling for.\u0027You\u0027ve got to love the poem you want to learn,\u0027 said Michael Rosen.For her part, Professor Goswami explained that you need to learn your poem by saying it out loud. Hearing the words and feeling the rhythm are important.Pick a poem you like and speak it out loud, then learn it, repeating it line by line, in the shower, in the kitchen, in the car or out of doors when you are on a walk.I have seven grandchildren and for Christmas I want each of them to learn a poem for me. Michael Rosen suggests Benjamin Zephaniah\u0027s \u0027Be nice to yu turkeys dis Christmas\u0027 Dame Judi hopes at least one of them tries a Shakespeare sonnet the Duchess recommends any of Hilaire Belloc\u0027s Cautionary Tales.It will be a challenge, but if they manage it, the poems they will learn will be with them for the rest of their lives — good companions jostling around in the rattle bags of their minds.And if the grandchildren can do it, so can the grandparents.Whatever your age, for the sake of your mind learn a poem by heart before Christmas.

They found a clinic in Cyprus, The Kolan British IVF Center, where a doctor declared her physically ‘like a 30-year-old’.After taking the preparatory drugs at home, they flew back to Cyprus where her eggs were fertilised with Stephen’s sperm and the embryos placed in an incubator, to see which would thrive.A few days later, the healthiest four were inserted into Tracey’s womb and the couple flew back home.An agonising two-week wait followed before Tracey was due to attend a private clinic in London, where a blood test would reveal if the cycle had been successful.However, after 12 days the couple could stand the suspense no longer and she took a home urine test. ‘When the word “Pregnant” flashed up on the display screen, neither of us could actually believe our eyes,’ says Tracey.Later scans revealed that, while one of the embryos had failed to implant, another had split into two, creating identical twin girls.Two weeks later, after going to her local hospital in London with stomach pains, Tracey was advised to ‘reduce’ the pregnancy by having two of the babies injected in the womb to stop their hearts.The consultant said he had known only one mother of quads to make it to 34 weeks. With a history of premature births — her middle child was born ten weeks early — Tracey’s chances of keeping her babies in the womb long enough to avoid them being born with serious medical problems were slim. Infants born before 28 weeks are more likely to have disabilities, including cerebral palsy, and problems with their eyes, lungs, heart and kidneys.Also, the risks to her own health were not insignificant, with an increased risk of developing potentially fatal pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes.By opting to abort two, and then carrying the dead foetuses until after the birth, Tracey was advised she would increase the chances of survival and good health for her other babies.But by then, she’d had several scans in which she had seen the four foetuses — with their beating hearts and kicking limbs — and had bonded with each of them as iniduals.Desperate for an alternative, three months into the pregnancy, she contacted a specialist in the U.S. who has delivered 150 sets of quads.He reassured her that her chances of a successful pregnancy were increased because, at 5ft 7in, Tracey is relatively tall, meaning there would be more room for the babies to grow.Tracey also talked things through with a counsellor in London, who invited a retired paediatrician to one of their sessions. It was he who convinced her not to go ahead with a selective termination.‘He knew of quads who had survived after being born at 23 weeks and said if I could get to 28 weeks, I would be fine,’ says Tracey. ‘He also asked if I would be able to bear to watch two of my children growing up while thinking about the two I didn’t have.’Tracey was due to have the injections the following day, at around 13 weeks into her pregnancy, but, deciding to let ‘nature take its course’, rang the hospital and cancelled the appointment.Her obstetrician — she is unwilling to disclose where she is receiving antenatal care or at which hospital the babies will be born — is hoping that she will make it to 34 weeks, when the babies will be delivered by Caesarean section.Her focus, for now, is purely on making it to that date: ‘I’m not thinking about the early weeks and months of their lives because I don’t want to get stressed. The most important thing right now is to keep them safe inside me,’ says Tracey.‘When I do allow my mind to race ahead, I picture them at about eight months, when they will be able to hold a bottle and feed themselves.‘My husband is more prone to worry than me, so I try to reassure him that the babies will be healthy and we will manage. I’ll say, “I’m staying strong for six of us here!”’While Tracey, a former drugs counsellor, should be allowed home within a few days of the birth, her babies’ prematurity will mean they’ll have to spend some time in the special care baby unit.Consequently, while she’s bought baby clothes, the couple are holding off buying Moses baskets and a quad buggy (the one she wants will cost £1,150 and is to be imported from Australia) until after the birth.‘I can’t order them yet. Imagine if not all the babies make it?’ says Tracey, her eyes brimming with tears. ‘I wouldn’t be able to bring myself to look at them.’On the advice of one midwife with twins, Tracey plans to dress each baby in one particular colour and has sets of sleepsuits, cardigans and hats in light pink, dark pink, red and blue so that she will be able to tell them apart at a glance.This will make it easier to keep track of which babies have been fed and changed, as well as, in future years, recognise who’s who in photographs.However, even with such systems in place, and help from Stephen, whose boss has said he can have as much time off as he needs after the birth, Tracey is going to have her hands very full indeed.Both of her parents died some years ago, but her children and siblings are supportive and will help in any way they can.          This ultrasound was taken on May 31 this year and shows her four childrenThe only voices of dissent have, she insists, been online where critics have called Tracey selfish and attacked her decision to have IVF at 50, resulting in quads whose care is ‘likely to cost the NHS hundreds of thousands of pounds’.So distressing has she found these remarks that, two weeks ago, she left her home to spend a couple of nights alone in a hotel, worried that the stress and anxiety might induce early labour.Her daughter, who is 32 and has three children of her own, was born when Tracey was 18. Tracey says they are the best of friends.In fact, it was her daughter who insisted on paying for her mum to have that revelatory early scan and she is looking forward to the arrival of her half-siblings, who will be aunts and uncle to her children.While delighted by the prospect of becoming a father again, four times over even, and supportive of Tracey speaking about their news, Stephen, who has a teenager from a previous marriage, shies away from the limelight. So just how did this middle-aged couple end up expecting quads — and making history?They met in 2005, two years after Tracey separated from her first husband, when her eldest children were in their late teens and her youngest son was nine.Two years later, Tracey, aged 39, discovered she was pregnant. However, not having planned the baby, neither felt the time was right.The main reason, according to Tracey, is that she was about to become a grandma — both her daughter and her eldest son’s girlfriend were pregnant — so she opted to have an abortion.It was the trauma of this termination — carried out when she was 19 weeks pregnant and which she deeply regrets — that started her obsession with trying for another baby, she says.As she was so far gone, Tracey had to first take a pill to stop the baby’s heart and then return two days later and swallow another pill to induce labour.‘By then I could feel the baby moving,’ says Tracey tearfully. ‘No one warned me it would be so traumatic and that I would actually have to give birth, rather than have an operation. I cried and cried.‘Neither of us could bear to look at the baby once it was born, but the midwife told us it was a little boy. It was horrendous — the memory still haunts me to this day.’Six weeks later, Tracey’s beloved mum, Pauline, died unexpectedly, aged 66, due to a blockage in the main artery to her heart.Tracey convinced herself that this was karma and she was being punished for ending her son’s life. She sunk into a deep depression, for which her GP prescribed medication, and has felt unable to work since.In an attempt to heal their pain, a few months after the termination, the couple, who married in 2012, began trying for another baby.Tracey is convinced the babies are a gift from her mother ‘who always wanted twins’ in the family, and not merely because it was her inheritance that funded the treatment.Each baby weighs an estimated 2lb at the moment. They will be born in November, if Tracey makes it that far, by which time they should have gained an extra pound.          ‘No one criticised Mick Jagger, Ronnie Wood or Elton John when they became fathers in their 60s and 70s,’ says Tracey defiantly. ‘So why are they attacking me?\u0027They are unlikely to be allowed home until after Christmas, when they should finally be robust enough to survive in the world.While that, of course, is when the hard work will really begin, Tracey is looking forward to no longer being pregnant.‘It’s so exhausting. Once I’ve made it through this pregnancy, I’m sure I’ll be able to survive anything.’But what of those who think 50 is too old to have a baby and that she will be mistaken for her children’s gran at the school gates?And that, even if Tracey and Stephen survive the round-the-clock feeds, nappy changes and toddler tantrums, come their mid-60s they will be no match for four stroppy teens?‘Times have changed. I remember organising my mum’s 50th birthday party and she seemed old to me back then.‘But we women take better care of ourselves now. Everyone tells me I don’t look my age, and I believe you really are only as old as you feel. Thankfully, I still feel young.‘My older children have never been in any trouble, and all three are hardworking, so hopefully I can do as good a job with these little ones.‘I’ve really no idea how people who say I’m selfish can think it’s anything other than selfless to love and nurture my babies.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/25/13/50A5F0FA00000578-0-image-m-10_1537879156997.jpg","title":"Why Donatella Versace selling family label giants Michael Kors","story":"    Donatella Versace, Carla Bruni, Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Helena Christensen on the catwalkVersace show, Runway, Spring Summer 2018, Milan Fashion WeekMichael Kors snaps up fashion house Versace in $2.1billion...Share this articleYet, this week, it appeared she was doing just that, when it was announced that Versace has been sold to U.S. clothing giant Michael Kors for an astonishing £1.6 billion.No wonder eyebrows were raised as far as the sartorial set’s Botox would allow, with fans scorning an acquisition they said would ‘ruin’ the brand and ‘kill’ the exclusive image on which it built its success.Michael Kors, which last year bought Jimmy Choo for nearly £900 million, plans to open 100 new Versace boutiques in a bid to double sales, focus more on the lucrative accessories market and combine all three brands into a company called Capri Holdings, of which Donatella will lead the ‘creative vision’.The mother of two, who owns the label with her other brother Santo, 73, and daughter Allegra, 32, insists the label had to be sold in order for it to ‘reach its full potential’.She also stressed her ‘passion’ has ‘never been stronger’ — although passion for what is unclear. Was she referring to her passion for Versace or for the £200 million winging into her bank account following the takeover? Her passion for the luxury holidays she loves to share on Instagram, and will now have more time for — or her passion for her family, which has, at times, appeared pushed to breaking point by the cut-throat fashion world?Either her decision to step back has been sudden or kept a fiercely guarded secret. Last September, she was emphatic about staying in her role, saying: ‘I’m not going anywhere right now,’ and, in an interview this month, Donatella waxed lyrical about her beloved brand without so much as a hint.So, what possessed her to hand over the reins of her company?          Gianni Versace with his sister Donatella Versace in 1993. She would inherit the brand after his deathA FUTURE SET IN STONE FROM BIRTHThe daughter of an Italian seamstress, Donatella grew up idolising Gianni, eight years her senior. ‘He made cool leather mini-skirts for me, took me to discos and treated me like a woman,’ she has recalled. ‘I was his doll and his best friend.’Describing her youth as ‘the happiest time of my life’ she was, nonetheless, shackled by her sibling’s success and denied autonomy from an early age.By the time she’d completed a languages degree, Gianni, who founded Versace in 1978, was already a successful designer and Donatella’s fate had been sealed: ‘I finished university and just ran to work with him. Actually, I didn’t have a choice. He said: “You come and you don’t move any more.” ’Perhaps, after having her entire life mapped out, Donatella has finally snapped.BLINDSIDED BY HER BROTHER’S MURDERAs Gianni’s ‘accomplice’ and muse, Donatella schmoozed the stars as Santo took charge of Versace’s business side. Helped by the Versace-clad, newly coined ‘supermodels’ who strutted the catwalk singing George Michael’s Freedom in 1991 and that safety pin dress Elizabeth Hurley wore in 1994, Versace’s status was consolidated.But, on July 15, 1997, the openly gay designer was shot outside his Miami mansion by serial killer Andrew Cunanan, who apparently was jealous of Gianni’s success. Cunanan then took his own life.‘The sight of my dead brother haunts me to this day. One bullet hit his neck, the other his face,’ said Donatella, who was then married to American model Paul Beck, with whom she had Allegra and a son Daniel, now 28.She was shaken both by grief and the responsibility of having her brother’s company foisted upon her, in what she has suggested was an unfair ruse: Gianni, who idolised Allegra, then aged just 11, had left his niece 50 per cent of the company in his will, while Donatella inherited 20 per cent and Santo 30 per cent.In so doing, Donatella says, he not only ‘put a tremendous burden’ on Allegra, but effectively trapped his sister: ‘By giving half of Versace to my daughter, he forced me to take responsibility for the company until she came of age.‘Without this trick, I might have left the company after his death.’          Versace store in Milan. Michael Kors plans to open 900 more Versace stores to double salesDOUBTS, DEBTS AND A DRUG HABITNow in charge, Donatella’s early collections were panned. Having taken cocaine since her 20s, her escalating addiction became an open secret in the industry and her leadership style erratic.According to Deborah Ball, author of the book House Of Versace, Donatella rarely turned up to meetings before noon and, on occasion, openly snorted cocaine in front of staff. ‘For the first five years, I was lost,’ Donatella later admitted. ‘I made a lot of mistakes.’Having boasted sales of more than £400 million in 1997, by 2004 the company was facing debts of around £90 million. Its clothes, capitalising on a Nineties era of conspicuous consumption, seemed increasingly irrelevant in the restrained Noughties and, by the middle of the decade, the business was close to going under.‘I wanted to succeed for Gianni, because he cared so much for the company and I knew he would have wanted it to carry on,’ said Donatella.‘But I was frightened and I had no confidence.’ADDICTION LED TO ELTON’S INTERVENTIONDonatella discovered cocaine in the Eighties at celebrity-studded parties, admitting it fuelled the ‘best time’.According to Gianni’s former partner of 15 years, Antonio D’Amico, the designer was ‘furious’ when he found out about his sister’s habit from their mutual friend, Elton John.‘He was shocked,’ says D’Amico, who describes Donatella as a ‘monster’, on account of her difficult behaviour, and says she ‘became angry, frustrated and suspicious of the people around her. She was very difficult to deal with’. In 2004, during Allegra’s 18th birthday party dinner in Milan, Elton arrived to drag Donatella off to a rehab clinic in Arizona by private plane, where she remained for two-and-a-half months.Donatella says: ‘Some evenings, I couldn’t function any more and embarrassed myself in front of my children. My self-hatred became more and more intense.‘Nobody thought I would accept Elton’s offer, but a few minutes later, I traded my evening gown and diamonds for a jogging suit.‘I made my way to the airport with a ponytail and no make-up.’SAVED BY HER FEMININE REVOLUTIONAFTER emerging from rehab, Donatella focused on collections that contained less of her brother’s brash exhibitionism and were, as she put it, ‘more feminine’. The strategy worked: in 2006, the label posted profits of £14.2 million and, in 2007, sales rose 30 per cent.Recent decisions have proved similarly successful, from the appointment of British CEO Jonathan Akeroyd, hired from Alexander McQueen in 2016, to Donatella dressing her friend and model-of-the-moment Gigi Hadid in a skintight Versace jumpsuit this year. ‘My revolution was successful,’ Donatella said, her pride in the transformation clear-cut — her decision to cash in now less so.CHILDREN WHO SHUN THE LIMELIGHTGiven that Donatella describes Allegra and Daniel as her ‘greatest achievement’, it must be painful that both are deeply uncomfortable in the limelight. They are perhaps the biggest reason for selling up.Allegra — who stands to inherit some £558 million after the Versace sale goes through — is a director of the company, but is not believed to have any great involvement in it.This private former anorexia sufferer used her father’s surname to escape her legacy, but admitted in 2011: ‘Anywhere I went, I was Versace. I couldn’t escape and it did me harm.’Daniel, a musician living in London who inherited his uncle’s art collection, is similarly keen to distance himself from his mother.‘He doesn’t want people to know he is my son,’ Donatella has said, admitting that she had promised not to talk about him publicly.          \u0027I\u0027m more of a private jet pooch\u0027 said Audrey Versace, Donatella\u0027s a dogLOVE AFFAIRS AND ‘GORGEOUS GUYS’predatory in her approach to men, yet tight-lipped about her love life, Donatella might want to distance herself from Versace so that she can date in secret.Not that she shows much intention of settling down.‘Men are needed only for love affairs and for physical relaxation,’ she said recently, adding that there have been ‘others’ since her 2000 orce but that: ‘I don’t need a husband or companion. I don’t like to live with anybody. I’m very happy and fulfilled with my private life.’After orcing Beck following 17 years together, she has made little comment about the marriage, other than to say they are ‘estranged’, but ‘civilised’.Her reported second marriage, in 2004, to businessman Manuel Dallori, lasted just a year and has been kept even more secret.She is, however, vociferous about her appreciation for the male form, sizing up a line-up of semi-naked male models on a tongue-in-cheek Instagram video and declaring unashamedly that: ‘I love being surrounded by gorgeous guys.’‘MASK’ OF BLONDE HAIR AND MAKE-UPHaving first had highlights on the instruction of Gianni at the age of 11, her peroxide locks — at times enhanced to waist-length with extensions — are synonymous with her high-maintenance brand: her hairstyle, perma-tan and trademark black kohl-lined eyes an attempt to present a competent façade, especially during times of crisis.‘My hair got blonder and blonder, my make-up thicker and thicker,’ she recalls of the period following her brother’s death.‘I felt like the whole world was looking at me with daggers in their eyes and I created a mask that would give me protection.’Having created ‘a second Donatella: cold and aloof, aggressive and scary’, she says she hasn’t been tempted to change her hairstyle because ‘blonde is a way of life. I survived the catastrophes in my life because of the strength that my blonde hair gives me’.          Donatella Versace (pictured) had this message for fans after Michael Kors bought the brandPROTEIN AND EIGHT ESPRESSOS A DAY At a diminutive 5ft 2in, Donatella says she feels ‘naked’ without high heels — indeed, she even wore them to rehab.Her whippet-thin frame, typically showcased in skintight jeans and dresses from her own line, is the result of ‘hard work’ — she claims to have exercised every day for the past 18 years ‘for at least five minutes’ and does a 45-minute cardio and weights routine four times a week.Donatella — who quit her two packets of Marlboro Red habit in 2013 — once said she stopped seeing a personal trainer because he wouldn’t let her smoke.As for her diet, lunch is salad and protein, with eight espressos a day as well as iced water sipped from a crystal glass to sustain her.PALATIAL HOMES AND LUXURY HOLIDAYSHome for Donatella is a palatial two-storey Milan flat that used to belong to Gianni, with marble columns, gold furnishings and vases of her favourite red roses.Holidays are gleefully showcased to her 3.5 million Instagram followers, from the tour she filmed of her private pool in the Palazzo Versace in Dubai — the £500 million neoclassical palace she opened in 2016 — to the video of her on a yacht with an unidentified topless hunk, and the picture of her lying bikini-clad on her back in aquamarine water, alongside the caption: ‘Wake me up when August ends.’One can only imagine she might get used to a life of leisure. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3145f5afe727715a8c3d2bee7b6f7b556cd3363c/0_265_2405_1443/master/2405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a9899fea1e81a906a61f6ea7931da41","title":"renaissance rivalry of mantegna and bellini","story":"With paintings so similar their origins have been disputed for centuries, these giants of Italian art are now being exhibited together for the first time at London’s National GalleryIn a small room in a former palace in Venice there is a strange, compelling painting set on an easel at head height so the viewer looks straight into eyes first depicted more than 500 years ago. It is very like an earlier painting now in Berlin and art historians have been arguing about them both for years.Both paintings ostensibly show the infant Jesus in the temple. The one at the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin, is agreed to be the work of Andrea Mantegna. The Venetian painting, made 20 years later, was credited to Mantegna also. But it is now accepted as by Giovanni Bellini.There is something unnerving about seeing it so close up on its easel the black background, the heads packed together, the baby as tightly swaddled as a chrysalis – apart from his poor little fingertips.Recently, an experiment was carried out in the former palace in Venice – a heart-stopping moment for Caroline Campbell. She is the curator of an exhibition at the National Gallery in London that will bring the two paintings together again in the first show to directly compare the work of both men. (The origins of the exhibition lie in the years she has spent puzzling over two more related works – Mantegna and Bellini’s versions of The Agony in the Garden, which have hung together in London since the 19th century.)A tracing of the Berlin Jesus painting on an acetate sheet was overlaid on to the Venice version. The six central figures matched exactly. “Anyone with eyes could see that there was a relationship between the two artists,” said Campbell, “but this was the first solid evidence of one man working directly from the other.”The relationship between the two men was well known. They were both giants of 15th-century Italian art: one, the stroppy son of a carpenter from a tiny village outside Padua the other, a mild-mannered Venetian born into the city’s most acclaimed family of artists.Bellini’s precise birth and death dates, where he lived and the exact site of his grave are not known, though he lived to the great age of 86 and died in Venice, rich and revered. A prodigy apprenticed as a child to a Paduan artist, Mantegna is less elusive because he was an argumentative soul and his life can be tracked in legal actions. He went to court to escape adoption by the master who trained him but wouldn’t pay him against a wealthy patron who felt he’d cheated her on the number of angels in her altar piece or, when he thought a studio assistant was stealing his ideas.Furthermore, Mantegna married Bellini’s sister Nicolosia – a beauty, if she was, as is presumed, the model for the Virgin. The match was probably made by her father Jacopo to bring the brilliant young man, already more famous than either of Jacopo’s artist sons Giovanni and Gentile, into his workshop without having to pay him. Although the two families remained in contact, Jacopo lost his prize when Mantegna accepted an invitation to become court painter to the Dukes of Mantua.While the Bellinis prospered in Venice, in later years Mantegna’s extravagant lifestyle, and problems with actually getting paid his princely salary, meant that he died in poverty near the church where he is buried, long after the sale of the extraordinary house he designed and built. It is still standing, although now a shell in use as a contemporary art gallery.His Jesus in the Temple painting may have been made to mark his marriage to Nicolosia and the hope of a child. Campbell believes that Bellini may have recreated it, incorporating more family portraits to mark the death of his father, Jacopo.The exhibition studies the relationship between their work and the extent to which they inspired, borrowed from, or even directly imitated one another. Campbell attributes to Mantegna the dramatic black backgrounds, which bring out the sculptural qualities of the figures in many of the smaller works the audacious experiments in perspective and foreshortening and his fascination with the architecture of classical Rome and Greece. (Roman fragments burst through the soil of Padua at every street corner.) She gives Bellini the prize for suffusing his paintings with light and for creating emotional warmth even when he was borrowing the figures from his brother-in-law or his father’s notebooks.As to which was the greater, visitors will be joining an argument now more than five centuries old. The 16th-century biographer Giorgio Vasari called Mantegna “praiseworthy in all his actions”, and predicted “his memory will ever live not only in his own country but in the whole world”.In 1504, a Venetian art dealer wrote to Isabella d’Este, patron of both artists: “Nobody can beat Mr Andrea Mantegna for invention in which he is the height of excellence … but in colour Giovanni Bellini is excellent.” Albrecht Dürer, a jealous assessor of the genius of other artists, wrote of Bellini, who was then working aged about 90, “still he is the best painter of them all”.Campbell keeps her counsel on the ancient debate, but there may be a clue in her intake of breath on a recent visit to the wondrous Bellini altarpiece in the Frari in Venice – the honeyed light in which the figures stand magnified by the golden rays of an autumn afternoon pouring in, as Bellini intended, from a tall window in the side wall. It is one of the masterpieces she never contemplated borrowing for the exhibition. “I don’t think this picture has ever left this space – and I hope it never will. It is just perfection.“To admire one is not to take from the other,” Campbell says firmly. “Mantegna for invention, Bellini for light, both are wonderful.”• Mantegna and Bellini is at the National Gallery, London, 1 October-27 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19bd1b710ad45b67df9cf4fd354193a6b72f3fe2/0_0_2362_1577/master/2362.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f406e5e268bc15df1a92d2c3e62a6082","title":"paul trevor ping pong portraitist in pictures","story":"Using the fast-moving skills he honed as a table tennis champ, Paul Trevor wandered through London’s financial district and a market in Brick Lane, taking spontaneous closeups.

A grave philosopher or a grim sort of comedian? A cosmopolitan lady’s man or a profound, ascetic seeker? Jew or Buddhist? Hedonist or hermit? Across his 82 years, the Montreal-born Leonard Cohen was all of these things – and in his posthumous book of poetry, given the Lawrentian title The Flame by his son Adam, all sides of the man are present.Other than that, Adam Cohen won’t say much more. “This was all private,” he says, sitting in an office on Los Angeles’s Wilshire Boulevard, near the house where his dad passed away after a late-night fall almost two years ago. “My father was very interested in preserving the magic of his process. And moreover, not demystifying it. Speaking of any of this,” he says, his voice dropping to a whisper, “is a transgression.” But after a few more remarks – stressing that Cohen wrote entirely in solitude, that he would consider discussion of his work a dangerous sort of “vanity” – Adam describes his late father, his sense of himself, and the heart of his achievement reasonably well.“It’s all song, and it’s all poetry – for him there wasn’t any delineation,” he says of the decades of wrestling over the nature of his father’s gift. To Cohen himself, though, it was never enough. “He’d call himself slow,” Adam says. “He’d write poems about how Leonard Cohen was a lazy bastard living in a suit.” In fact, Cohen was a fierce perfectionist, devoted to an almost impossible level of rigour, and the bearer of what his son calls “a monastic discipline”.Adam nods toward a finished copy of the book: “This is what he was staying alive for.” Cohen had leukaemia, and dropped hints about his impending demise on You Want It Darker, his final album. (“I’m leaving the table  I’m out of the game,” he sings on one of its tracks.)“He was a man on a quest, on a mission,” Adam says, describing his father’s increasing sense of purpose and dedication in his last months, which included sending “do not disturb” emails to friends and family so he could finish the project. “That probably bought him some time on Earth.”Countless rock singers, from folkies to CBGBs punks, have been lazily dubbed “poetic” but Cohen was, by any measure, the real thing: he published no fewer than four books of verse, across a decade, before the release of his first LP, the mostly acoustic, finger-picked Songs of Leonard Cohen, which led off with the undeniably poetic “Suzanne”. (Oddly, he actually made early forays into music as a teenager, forming a country-folk band with friends called the Buckskin Boys, but he largely let music drop until the release of his debut at age 33.) Those first poems emerged from a close-knit group of Canadian versifiers reading stanzas to each other in cafes and flats, printing mimeographed copies. “There were no prizes or grants or awards,” Cohen said in a 1993 radio interview. “There weren’t even any girls.” It seems appropriate that his last words – despite the power of You Want It Darker, released just weeks before his death – would come in the form of a posthumous book of verse.As a young man, Cohen’s favourite poet was perhaps Federico García Lorca he’d later name his daughter after the doomed Spaniard. But his sense of the art stretched back thousands of years and great writing would, he knew, outlive what he saw as his own meagre contributions. “He could recite to the letter,” Adam says. “Byron, Shakespeare, Rumi, the Bible … The guy was outrageously fluent.” Cohen once said his training, and sense of vocation, went back to Robert Burns, the French troubadours, Homer and King David. Adam calls his style “mytho-romantic,” which seems as good a term as any.Cohen was an exacting reader of the verse of others. In 2005, he sued his longtime business manager, a decade or so after she began taking his money. “He didn’t know where the accountant was cheating,” Adam says. “But you could present him with a poem, and he could tell where the poet was cheating.” For Cohen, faking it was not an option: his own work, Adam says, “was a mandate from God”.In the same way it’s hard to imagine Cohen with even an untucked shirt – in later life he almost always appeared in full suit and tie, typically with brimmed hat and leather shoes – it’s difficult to conceive of an unfinished song, a number that would have been improved with an additional verse, or played in a different key.For his final publication, he left almost nothing to chance. Unlike, say, the mass of work, unfinished and otherwise, that often appears after a writer or musician dies – the endless songs and demos authorised by the Jimi Hendrix estate, for instance, or the obsessive mining of Tolkien’s Middle-earth – The Flame shows the emphasis Cohen put on distillation. “Nothing about this book,” Adam says, “is haphazard.”Though Cohen came up during the beat era and admired Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, the cult of spontaneity never appealed to him. (“That’s never worked for me,” he said in 1993. “My first thoughts are dull, are prejudiced, are poisonous. I find last thought, best thought.”)The Flame is ided, as per Cohen’s instructions, into three sections, and organised by editors Robert Faggen and Alexandra Pleshoyano, scholars in California and Quebec respectively. The first is a selection of 63 poems, some of which have been published before, going back several decades. Adam calls the first, “Happens to the Heart,” the “blueprint” of the entire collection. Most of it is in rhyme and metre at least half could be described as light verse.The second section reprints the lyrics (sometimes differing from their recorded versions) from Cohen’s last three albums, plus “Blue Alert”, a 2006 recording by his former backing vocalist and romantic partner Anjani Thomas. (Cohen produced and wrote the lyrics.) On the page, the poise and polish of these songs remain striking.The third part is a selection from Cohen’s notebooks – distilled from more than 3,000 pages across roughly 60 years, up to and including, apparently, the day he died. A 2001 acceptance speech for a Spanish award serves as a brief coda. (There is also an email exchange with a friend even his online correspondence seems to be in rhyme and metre.)Included in various proportions are love, sex, death, regret, exaltation, piety and gentle fondness. The blending of the earthy with the spiritual – in his last years Cohen was as influenced by a Hindu teacher as much as the Buddhist guru he studied with on a California mountain – would give John Donne and Marvin Gaye a run for their money.Throughout the book are sketches by Cohen, mostly self-portraits, with a few, unsurprisingly, of musical instruments and topless women. Even as the body failed, the flame of Cohen’s libido seemed to continue burning.While the notebooks are uneven, reading them makes for a bittersweet experience: it’s hard not to see these as the seeds of Cohen songs we never got to hear, finished poems we’ll never get to read.But Cohen never rushed his output, and could go almost a decade between albums. This wasn’t because ideas and images didn’t flow: he apparently filled notebooks every day of his life, and Adam describes finding them, as a child, in the poet’s desk drawers and jacket pockets, even, later, while seeking a bottle of tequila, coming upon a chilled, forgotten notebook in the freezer.This is an artist who worked on a single song – what would become “Hallelulah” – for several years, writing 80 drafts and as many verses, only to have it rejected by his record label. (The final, much shorter, version became, after covers by John Cale and Jeff Buckley, Cohen’s most recorded song.)He wasn’t, then, one to dash things off. Despite the generous and world-weary humour that emerged in his last decades, – his early, folkie work was denounced as “humourless” –the task of writing was deadly serious. He surely knew the line from Yeats – a poet he deeply admired – about how “The intellect of man is forced to choose  Perfection of the life, or of the work.” On this wager, Cohen was unambiguous.“Religion, teachers, women, drugs, the road, fame, money,” Adam quotes his father saying “nothing gets me high and offers relief from the suffering like blackening pages, writing.” It was also, he writes in his foreword, “a statement of regret”, since Cohen sacrificed so much – he never married, considered himself a poor father, let his health and financial state decline – for the Muse. Amidst numerous liaisons and botched relationships, poetry is the one thing he remained entirely faithful to. The Flame is the incontrovertible proof.I was always working steady But I never called it artI was funding my depression Meeting Jesus reading Marx Sure it failed my little fire But it’s bright the dying spark Go tell the young messiah What happens to the heartThere’s a mist of summer kisses Where I tried to double-park The rivalry was viciousAnd the women were in charge It was nothing, it was business But it left an ugly markSo I’ve come here to revisit What happens to the heartI was selling holy trinketsI was dressing kind of sharp Had a pussy in the kitchen And a panther in the yardIn the prison of the giftedI was friendly with the guard So I never had to witness What happens to the heartI should have seen it comingYou could say I wrote the chart Just to look at her was troubleIt was trouble from the startSure we played a stunning couple But I never liked the partIt ain’t pretty, it ain’t subtleWhat happens to the heartNow the angel’s got a fiddle And the devil’s got a harpEvery soul is like a minnow Every mind is like a sharkI’ve opened every windowBut the house, the house is dark Just say Uncle, then it’s simple What happens to the heartI was always working steadyBut I never called it artThe slaves were there already The singers chained and charred Now the arc of justice bending And the injured soon to marchI lost my job defending What happens to the heartI studied with this beggarHe was filthy he was scarred By the claws of many women He had failed to disregard No fable here no lessonNo singing meadowlarkJust a filthy beggar blessing What happens to the heartI was always working steady But I never called it artI could lift, but nothing heavy Almost lost my union cardI was handy with a rifleMy father’s .303We fought for something final Not the right to disagreeSure it failed my little fireBut it’s bright the dying spark Go tell the young messiah What happens to the heartover Reykjavik, the “smokey bay”\u0026nbspwhere W.H.

First, Italy is the third biggest economy in the eurozone after Germany and France. Second, its banking system is fragile after two decades in which the economy has posted precious little growth. And third, it has a new populist government – a coalition of the League and the Five Star Movement – with a radical agenda that includes raising pensions and introducing a basic income.Yes. The Italian banking system is seriously burdened with bad debts and that has meant its capacity to lend has been impaired. Low interest rates and the money creation programme known as quantitative easing have had much less of an impact in Italy than elsewhere in the eurozone. If monetary policy – interest rates and QE – is not working, there is an argument for fiscal policy – taxes and spending – to play a bigger role in generating demand. Stronger growth should eventually lead to higher tax revenues and a low deficit.Italian banks have been big buyers of the bonds sold by the government, and their financial position becomes shakier if those bonds go down in value. The markets are worried about a “doom loop” of weak growth, a rising deficit, losses on bonds and failing banks. They fear, also, that Italy’s problems will spill over into the rest of the eurozone, since banks in other countries – most notably, France – are big holders of Italian debt.Not yet, but all the ingredients are there. The comment by Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister, that jobs and pensions matter more to him than the views of “EU bureaucrats” shows that Rome and Brussels are on a collision course at a time when the eurozone economy is slowing and financial markets are jumpy.

A choice example came late on last night, after TV audiences in the US and around the world were riveted by the sight of Trump’s choice for the supreme court ranting and raving, his face twisted in fury, as he insisted he was innocent of the sexual assault that had just been detailed in calm, precise terms by Christine Blasey Ford. “Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him,” Trump tweeted, the statement truer and more revealing than he realised.For Brett Kavanaugh’s astonishing performance, and that of the Republican senators at Thursday’s hearing, shone a light on a phenomenon that Trump both feeds and exemplifies: a sense of male entitlement so extreme it resents any restraint. It is a swaggering machismo that believes rules are for limp-wristed wimps that in its most radical form places itself above the law. This phenomenon stretches beyond the partisan battles of Washington DC, beyond even the battlefield of sexual harassment: it is instead a core, if underplayed, aspect of the populist wave currently upending the politics of Asia, continental Europe and Britain.Start with the Thursday display on Capitol Hill, where it was a shock to see how little senate Republicans had learned from the #MeToo movement or from their experience in 1991, when Anita Hill testified about the sexual misconduct of supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas. Once again, a woman was forced to speak of painful, intimate experience before a Republican group that was all white, all male. But it was the nominee himself who delivered a masterclass in male privilege, flushed and raging at the impudence of those who dared stand between him and the seat he believed was his right. He gave explanations that were so implausible they simply had to be false, he implied without evidence that one female Democratic senator had a drink problem, he lashed out at a supposed leftwing conspiracy, alleging this was all “the revenge of the Clintons” coming across as a partisan political hack with an honesty problem rather than a would-be member of the nation’s highest court.In a hearing that was a test of credibility, it’s useful to imagine how this would have played out if the roles had been reversed. If Ford had behaved like Kavanaugh, she would be instantly dismissed as a hysterical, vengeful woman who could not be believed. Yet Republicans on the senate judiciary committee agreed unanimously to promote him until one demanded an FBI investigation. Given what we now know about him and his temperament, it’s a wonder he’s allowed to serve on any court at all.This episode will leave a lasting cloud over the supreme court and its standing in US national life. For their system to work, Americans need to see the judiciary as wise, just and above the fray. If Kavanaugh is approved on Tuesday, they will know their supreme court includes two men credibly accused of sexual misconduct, one of whom has a temper he can’t control.But these events also illuminate something larger. For what the world has seen is a toxic masculinity that has become a force in US politics, most certainly, but elsewhere too. Of course, Trump is the lead exponent: himself credibly accused by multiple women, having boasted of grabbing women “by the pussy”, he has repeatedly defended men accused of sexual violence and dismissed their accusers as “con jobs”.Competition in the global misogyny league comes from Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte, whose response to the rape and killing of an Australian missionary in the town where he was once mayor was to say, “They raped her, they lined up. I was angry because … she was so beautiful, the mayor should have been first. What a waste.” Meanwhile, Viktor Orbán’s government in Hungary distributes primary school textbooks that have revived the part of a traditional children’s song that cheerfully describes men beating their wives as a normal part of family life. In Britain, our own wannabe Trump is Boris Johnson who, when looking to take a cheap, rabble-rousing shot at Muslims, aimed his fire at Muslim women and their appearance.This is not a coincidence. Much of the commentary on populism emphasises its appeal not only to economic anxiety, but to the sense of cultural displacement felt by those who fear ethnic and racial ersity. What’s discussed less often is the specific appeal to men, angry that their status has been shaken by the shifts of the last several decades.Trump’s pep rally speeches are full of barely coded promises to return to the era when men were men, and when their place at the top of the heap was automatic and assured. His undisguised disrespect for women – attacking them for their looks, calling them dogs – sends that message loud and clear. The 4Chan types who rally to Trump admit they do so in part because they believe he embodies an unabashed masculinity – that when they’re with him, they no longer feel “weak”.But this toxic masculinity does not manifest itself only in relation to women. It also underpins the politics of those who revel in the macho posture, substituting the careful deliberation of, say, a Barack Obama – an approach they would deem effeminate – for action driven by instinct, from the gut, regardless of the rules or consequences.You see it in Trump tearing up treaties, burning up alliances and trampling all over the constitution – and in his admiration for the almost comically macho figure of Vladimir Putin, revering the Russian leader especially, it seems, for his disregard for international norms – just as you hear it in Duterte threatening to “slaughter” three million drug addicts. As Trump and Duterte might put it, the law is for pussies and they are above it. Even as a candidate, Trump said he could shoot people on Fifth Avenue and get away with it.In Britain, the form is milder but the macho mindset is similar. Note the Brexiteers who believe the UK could walk away from its legal obligations to the EU, not pay its bills and show Brussels the middle finger – if only our leaders had the balls to do it. Think of David Davis and his risible SAS shtick or Johnson fantasising about how Trump would handle the Brexit talks: “He’d go in bloody hard,” he drooled.That’s language Brett Kavanaugh could get behind. For he embodies this dominant strain of our current politics. No matter that he’s a judge: for him, an angry man who opposed an investigation of the facts and full legal process should be heard ahead of a woman eager for the facts to be known. In that dismal sense, truly, Kavanaugh is a man of our time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a20ee1ef95317e1c0940109259f645db3c98863/0_322_3975_2386/master/3975.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2700da229908ffb337c60f7ee716ef7","title":"top schools call for an end to universities use of unconditional offers","story":"Heads claim they encourage A-level students to ‘take their foot off the gas’Elite private schools have called for universities to cut back on the use of unconditional offers for undergraduate places over fears that pupils will not be motivated to strive for high A-level grades.Mike Buchanan, the executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents many of the country’s most expensive independent schools, claimed that pupils “take their foot off the gas” after accepting offers that do not require specific A-level grades.“These youngsters have to carry their results with them for their whole careers,” Buchanan, the former headteacher of Ashford School in Kent, told the Times newspaper.“I am asking universities to stop using them unless they have interviewed the pupil and got some sense that it would be good for this pupil, or have consulted the school, which has given you the same information.”Until recently only a small number of school-leavers were given unconditional offers. But the government’s removal of its cap on funded undergraduate numbers has allowed universities in England to expand and aggressively compete for students and their tuition fees.While there is little recent evidence to show whether pupils with unconditional offers achieve disappointing final grades, private school heads have long been hostile because of the potential impact on their school’s results and league table rankings.Some employers pay close attention to A-level grades in recruiting for graduate trainee programmes, meaning that students who underperform may later struggle in the job market.The HMC’s call follows that of Sam Gyimah, the higher education minister, who said in July that the rise in unconditional offers was “completely irresponsible to students, and universities must start taking a lead by limiting the number they offer”.In most cases, universities make conditional offers, detailing specific A-level grades that applicants need to achieve to take up a place . However, greater competition has seen the use of unconditional offers spread to universities in the more selective Russell Group of research-intensive institutions.Ucas said the offers were more common for older students who already held qualifications, to creative arts course applicants who submit portfolios or attend auditions, and for students with mental health difficulties.Vice-chancellors have defended unconditional offers as allowing earlier engagement between universities and students, and making it easier to plan courses and accommodation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07fe2af30462bfdde004c0d7535c2c76ceafee09/0_0_4070_2711/master/4070.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c39df1b3eafe5c7ecf6f661ecb400a2b 1400w","title":"mulberry how to sell british heritage to a global market","story":"At a presentation as part of Paris fashion week, the brand best known for its leather Alexa handbags set out its international vision Mulberry may have been absent from the London fashion week schedule last week, but that is not to say it is not on full showman form. Fresh from its sojourn to Seoul earlier this month, where it showed off its latest see-now, buy-now collection, the brand popped up in Paris on Wednesday. It’s all a part of its push “to show the brand in different countries and to become more known”, according to creative director Johnny Coca, who joined the heritage house famous for its much imitated Bayswater and Alexa handbags in 2015.When it comes to the collections, however, the UK is a regular source of inspiration for Coca. Whereas in previous collections he has explored rebellious and aristocratic icons, the springsummer 2019 collection shown in Paris this week drew from the swinging sixties, a period “of freedom, emancipation and revolution”, according to the designer. Psychedelic prints and patent rain macs with big buttons were met with multicoloured platforms and go go boots – the uniform of starlets such as Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton and their imitators on Carnaby Street and King’s Road. “The 60s is one of the strongest moments in the UK for music, art, design and the power of the girls. They took the power and decided how they wanted to be.”This ode also comes at the same time as a pressing concern for Mulberry: the implications of Brexit. Despite it being the market leader in leather goods and having its own production line based in Bath and Somerset, the company is limited in terms of the materials it can source and so relies upon mainland Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4085658bf575c395e6b75f4f3497f2acbafdd275/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c926e82aab7b5b6093e1034b4681af7a","title":"slimane celine paris fashion week","story":"Brutally slender, polished to perfection and a fastidious kind of after-dark decadence, the first show under Hedi Slimane’s tenure signals a new direction for the French fashion house At the most anticipated show of Paris fashion week, with Lady Gaga, Karl Lagerfeld and Catherine Deneuve watching from the front row, Hedi Slimane launched a blitzkrieg on Celine, which for a decade under Phoebe Philo embodied the female gaze in fashion. In the shadow of Les Invalides, the site of Napoleon’s tomb, Slimane jettisoned elegant trousers, silk blouses, understated knitwear and unstructured trenchcoats for dolly-sized sequin micro shifts and tiny leather skirts.The day of the Kavanaugh hearings in Washington arguably not being the patriarchy’s finest hour, it was an uncomfortable moment for Slimane to raze to the ground the female design philosophy of a house which, for a decade under Philo, was notable for not equating a woman’s power with her sexuality.But razing to the ground is the modus operandi which has made Slimane one of the most polarising figures in fashion – and one of the most successful. This show was entitled Celine 01, and Slimane was clear that Philo’s work had no bearing on his. “You don’t enter a fashion house to imitate the work of your predecessor,” he told Le Figaro. The show began and ended with drummers from France’s republican guard accompanying the first look: a black and white polka dot silk mini cocktail dress dominated by an outsized bow.It has been 17 years since Slimane transformed the wardrobes of men all over the world with the groundbreaking slender tailoring he introduced at Dior Homme. Mainstream male sex appeal, hitherto centred on muscles and beefcake, pivoted to the skinny black jean under Slimane’s direction. Precious few designers can claim to have opened the door of the world’s wardrobe with such force.With Slimane’s appointment, Celine has expanded to include menswear as well as womenswear, and the beating heart of this collection was in Slimane’s signature slim men’s tailoring. “The line is the basis of everything,” he said this week, and that line remained unchanged: brutally slender, polished to perfection, a fastidious kind of after-dark decadence.“You have to be yourself, against all odds,” he told Le Figaro. In his passion for skinny androgyny he is being himself, which history suggests would be a huge success. Fashion reflects the world we live in, as Coco Chanel observed. The female point of view appears to have fallen out of style."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bde53bfab45f752f0423461a10de1c7b166975/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f40f06a7976a63d80404621f00899d","title":"nine simple ways to revamp your workspace for a healthier environment","story":"Improving your posture at work, adding some greenery to your desk and moving to a window seat are just some of the quick fixes that can transform your productivityThere’s a lot more to happiness in the workplace than a comfortable salary. In fact, working more than 40 hours a week may well be doing you a considerable disservice and directly affecting your health and performance at work. Thankfully, taking a few minutes of your day and deploying intelligent fixes can turn your office from a dreary workspace to an area that transforms your productivity and mindset. Here are nine ways you can make your office work for you.Take a standThere’s a reason standing desks – no longer the reserve of agile Silicon Roundabout startups – are quickly making their way into the offices of multinationals. Encouraging employees to be considerably more aware of their posture at work, adjustable desks and workstations such as Varidesk and the Yo-Yo desk are quickly becoming adopted by offices across the UK. What’s more, sitting for more than six hours a day leaves you at greater risk of anxiety and depression, according to the Association for Psychological Science – meaning that an eight-hour day spent on your rear quickly becomes an unhealthy habit.Spring cleaningOld meeting notes, dirty mugs, empty sandwich boxes and a dirty keyboard all add up to an unhappy desk. According to a study by Princeton Neuroscience Institute, “multiple visual stimuli” – also known as unwelcome desk clutter – compete for attention in your brain, meaning you can remove distraction with a desk free of unnecessary mess. Similarly, you’ll want to give your keyboard a wipe-down every week or so, as the average keyboard has 20,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.Stretch it outStressful experiences – at work and at home – have the potential to age the human brain by four years, according to a 2017 study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s conference. Thankfully, you can de-stress and fight poor posture at your desk by working through this stretching routine. To open up your back, bring your hands behind you and press your palms together. Bring your elbows back and downwards, slowly tucking your chin – hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat three times. Consider this your first step to become a more supple – and pain-free – human.Make a moveFor now, there are no stringent laws on taking screen breaks, but the Health and Safety Executive recommends a five- to 10-minute break every hour. Standing up and walking around will help stretch your body, adjust your posture and increase productivity and attention, as well as the quality of your work.Give yourself a handSpending 35-plus hours at a desk each week is hardly appealing, the very real prospect of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) – a condition in which a nerve in your wrist is under pressure, causing numb hands, weakness and tingling – is far worse. Common in men and women over 40 years old, CTS stems from repetitive actions such as using a mouse and keyboard. Handily, ergonomic office equipment – Microsoft Surface and Mac-friendly Kinesis Freestyle are two of the UK’s most popular options – can help stave CTS off. The oddly shaped equipment improves forearm posture, adds comfort and supports your hands. You’ll agree that it’ll be worth a few odd looks.Thirsty workWorkplace absence in the UK is costing £18bn annually, according to analysis from Centre of Economic and Business Research. That’s a total of 168m working days lost annually. While there’s no sole reason for this, it’s important to adopt everyday habits to keep you as healthy as possible in the workplace. Dehydration, for example, even at a mild level, directly affects both physical and mental performance, meaning that you’ll find it hard to concentrate during work hours and struggle with that post-work run. Women should aim for two litres a day, and men for three litres.Light workIf constantly feeling tired is making office life a miserable reality, it could be because of the light levels in your office. A 2013 study from the Netherlands found that when office workers were exposed to more daylight during the working week, they were less sleepy and considerably more energetic. Similarly, researchers from Turkey found that study participants who had three hours or more of daylight a day felt considerably happier and more satisfied – muting the chance of office burnout. Push for that window desk and reap the rewards immediately.Pain in the neckYour career, rather unfortunately, is wreaking havoc on your neck. A combination of poor posture and stress, which affects your sleep, is likely to be causing unnecessary neck pain. Rarely a sign of something more serious, neck pain can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as Voltarol, which can be taken orally or applied directly to the affected area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60c9ed665a8e025056a6c61bbfda3a2bd4d06e0d/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c43b351abbf68467e2e5c9c92f00f67f","title":"blind date essa steffi","story":"Did musician Essa, 22, and 20-year-old student Steffi hit it off?What were you hoping for?A fun evening of good food and conversation.What did you talk about?Sylvia Plath, existentialism, performance art, my unusual degree in the recorder.Any awkward moments?I probably shouldn’t have tried to explain the plot arc of Doctor Who season 6 with quite so much enthusiasm.Best thing about Steffi?Her infectious laugh.Would you introduce her to your friends?

I was struggling with the heartbreak, with being replaced. I was living a half-life,” she recalls.Then her friend Vicky called. Vicky’s relationship had also broken down, leaving her with a 10-month-old daughter, a house that was up for sale, and rent she couldn’t afford. As a temporary measure, Janet invited Vicky and her daughter Daisy to move into her spare room.Not long afterwards, Janet met Nicola, a woman she recognised from the baby-group circuit, who was living nearby in south London. They chatted and swapped numbers, agreeing that a coffee might be nice. When Nicola mentioned that weekends would be good, Janet rightly deduced that she, too, was a newly single mother.And so, more by accident than design, the women hit on a new domestic set-up: the “mommune”, as it is termed in America. And for the next two years, the three of them and their six children shared their lives: Vicky in the spare room, Nicola a weekend resident and daily visitor. “We were a family,” Janet says. “We went to the supermarket together, cooked together, ate together, shared childcare. Our parents met.” The children, she adds, “became like siblings”.“The mum house saved me,” Janet says today, seven years on. “It wasn’t a grand plan, it just seemed a practical solution. We instantly stopped feeling so broken.”The impact of living with people who understood what she was experiencing was profound for Janet. When Janet and her husband split after 11 years together, her social life died with the relationship. However hard the couple tried to share access and discourage side-taking, the situation was awkward. “If I went to something, friends were always with their partners and there I was, on my own, with the children. If anyone saw my ex with his new partner, they felt they couldn’t tell me.”In the shared house, “We all knew what the others were going through without having to explain. We shared the pain. We could be as mad as we liked,” Janet says. “If you can’t express those feelings to someone, then they are just echoing back in your face all the time.”For Vicky, the everyday, on-tap adult companionship and conversation transformed not only her emotional state but also, quite unexpectedly, she says, her understanding of family. “Very quickly it felt as if we were building a different family unit,” she says. “It was based on sharing, supporting each other. That’s what really makes a family. There was a sense of there being a plan. It didn’t feel as if there was a big gap, as if we needed someone else here.”For Nicola, too – in the house with her children at least one evening a week and each weekend – staying in the house was a source of comfort and fun. “I was the only person I knew who was orced, until I bumped into Janet and saw how we mirrored each other,” she says. “Having us all together was so important for stopping the children feeling weird, too – knowing there were others in the same boat. And we could do normal family stuff, just hanging out, having tea, going to the park.”Having initially wanted to sell up and leave town (too many memories), Janet realised she didn’t need to move on: the whole atmosphere of the house had changed. “It felt like a home again. When my ex-husband left, it had sort of died. But it had a beating heart again.” The new arrangement restored her attachment to the house she and her ex had bought and painstakingly done up as newlyweds. “The place became important to me again.”Janet, Vicky and Nicola (who slept in Janet’s son’s bunk bed when her children were away, “to avoid going back to an empty house”) settled into a domestic routine. “It was like a marriage, only better. We had a kind of invisible rota. We cooked proper dinners for each other every night. We had roles.” Janet did the paperwork. Vicky baked. Nicola cooked Sunday dinners and, she says, cleaned up after parties.Because they saw each other as much more than housemates, there were, Janet says, no petty student house-style squabbles. “We are all very neat and tidy, but also laid-back. So if there was a bit of a mess around, you just tidied it up. When you have been through something as awful as orce, that sort of thing seems like nothing.”While the adults had chosen this domestic arrangement, their children, of course, had not. Throwing them together could have created a difficult dynamic.“Making sure the children had a positive experience was paramount. We had to create a real home for them, too,” Janet says. “But just having each other’s support actually gave us the emotional space to be better parents.”There were mass outings – “rowing on the river at Richmond or going to Hyde Park, proper days out we wouldn’t have got round to on our own” – and in time the children formed bonds. These remain strong seven years after the arrangement ended. “There was real depth, so it was always much more than a play-date friendship, but without the pressure of a blended family. They didn’t suddenly have to become siblings,” Janet says.As with the adults, the children benefited from being around peers with shared experience. “The older girls in particular talked a lot about how they felt.”Discipline, a potential source of contention, was addressed. “We didn’t have the same parenting styles. Vicky was the most relaxed – they all knew she might slip them some extra sweets – but we agreed on the fundamentals, and we were comfortable telling anyone off if needed.”The children now arrange regular sleepovers. “They talk about those times a lot: the firework party where we nearly set the house on fire, the trips, the Santa-mummies, the Christmas with the tree that was so tall we had to saw the top off to fit it in the house.”The second of these Christmases, celebrated a week early as all the children were going to their fathers, featured real snow. “The amazing non-Christmas was probably my happiest ever,” Janet says.But soon after this, Janet met her new husband, Neil. “I felt I had a lot to give up. I didn’t need a relationship, so I took it very slowly,” she says.In the end, the household ran its natural course. Janet got engaged Vicky and Daisy needed more space Nicola started a new career. “We all had very mixed feelings, but it felt like the right time to un-cocoon ourselves.”Their lives remain closely connected and the women still see each other every week. Vicky’s phone, Janet says, still has her listed as “wife”. “Our friendship has been totally bound by being there when we needed each other. It has become much more than the sum of its parts.”• The Single Mums’ Mansion by Janet Hoggarth is published by Head of Zeus on 4 October.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c0c862063d04883bac701d00c5ff7107bc3f804/398_592_3156_1893/master/3156.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a0c599e46ce8c8597177f60435e25a5","title":"tim dowling squirrel dog cat tortoise autumn","story":"I just want the creatures of the forest to fear me. Is that too much to ask?Early on Monday morning, a damp autumn chill greets me when I open the garden door. I make my way down the little brick path to my office shed, coffee in one hand, keys in the other, and walk straight through a spider’s web.The elaborate web has been constructed overnight as I move forwards, it wraps itself around my head, trapping the large and agitated spider at its centre against my lips. Generally speaking, I don’t have a problem with spiders, but I do have a problem with this. To anyone watching from a window, it would look as if I were trying, and failing, to defend myself against an invisible assailant, coffee flying everywhere.At some point in the middle of September, the local wildlife made a bid to reclaim the space between my office door and the kitchen. There are half a dozen fresh spiders’ webs in place every morning. By Wednesday, I’ve learned to windmill my arms as I walk across the lawn, but I’ve stopped pulling the spiders’ webs from my clothes. On Thursday morning, I step on a slug the size of a banana.Then there’s the squirrel, who has suddenly decided that my presence constitutes no hindrance to his autumn business. One afternoon, I look up from my work to see the squirrel sitting on my office step, watching me through the open door, and eating a cherry tomato with both hands.“That is my tomato,” I say.He looks at me as if to say: come and get it.The next day, I watch him sneak up on the cat, which is crouched under a bush, watching a pigeon. The squirrel approaches from behind until it’s within two feet of the cat’s back, and then does a taunting dance with its tail.“Hey!” I shout. By the time the cat’s head has turned, the squirrel is gone.“What is the point of having pets if they don’t keep wildlife at bay?” I say, walking into the kitchen.“What are you talking about?” my wife says.“The bold squirrel,” I say.“Oh, that one,” she says. “He really doesn’t give a shit.”“He runs around on the roof of my shed,” I say. “He decimates my crops right in front of me.”“You’re covered in spiders’ webs,” my wife says, brushing the back of my jumper.“I know,” I say. “I feel like Miss Havisham.”“They’re in your hair,” she says.“I just want the creatures of the forest to fear me,” I say. “Is that too much to ask?”The next morning, it’s raining when I open the back door. I find the tortoise sitting under the garden table, wearing an expression that says: I don’t like it out here any more.“Fair enough,” I say. I pick him up and take him back to the kitchen, where he crawls under the dog’s bed – a sure sign that summer is over.On the way back to my office, I notice a dense wigwam of runner bean plants rustling in the wind, except there is no wind. When I get closer, the whole assembly begins to shake violently, as if it means to rip itself from the ground. Then the squirrel pokes his head out from between the leaves and looks at me.“You,” I say.The squirrel cocks his head as if to say: that’s right, me.A few days later, the sun comes out and autumn is put on hold once more. I am sitting in my office with the door wide open, my eyes fixed on a point in space midway between my nose and my computer screen.My wife appears, giving me a jump. “Your squirrel just ran through the house,” she says.“What?” I say.“He got into some kind of standoff with the dog,” she says. “And the dog chased him into the kitchen, down the hall and out the front door.”“Why was the front door even open?” I ask.“I was taking out the recycling,” she says. “They both shot past me on my way back in.”“What if it hadn’t been open?” I say. “He’d be in there now, watching Netflix.”“He is bold,” she says.“This is not over,” I say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/980436e5e9f1eea9c3624d34e54c245db1daf05b/0_1155_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f766009d19687900153f79ae0b11b42d","title":"easy feasting spanish spiced roast rack of pork","story":"Smoked paprika and aromatic fennel add fire and flavour to a roasted rack of pork that’s low on effort, high on impact and perfect for sharingOutdoor late summer gatherings don’t always have to mean firing up the barbecue.

It sent the case back to the court for another trial.A phone message left with an attorney for Led Zeppelin, Peter Anderson, was not immediately returned.Michael Skidmore, a trustee for the estate of the late Spirit guitarist Randy Wolfe, filed the lawsuit against Led Zeppelin in 2015.Jurors returned their verdict for Led Zeppelin after a five-day trial at which the band members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant testified.Page says he wrote the music and Plant has claimed the lyrics, saying Stairway was an original. In several hours of often-animated and amusing testimony, they described the craft behind one of rock’s best-known songs.The jury found Stairway to Heaven and Taurus were not substantially similar, according to the ninth circuit ruling. But it also said the US district judge R Gary Klausner failed to advise jurors that while inidual elements of a song such as its notes or scale may not qualify for copyright protection, a combination of those elements may if it is sufficiently original, the ninth circuit judge Richard Paez said.Wesley Lewis, an attorney who handles copyright cases at the firm Haynes and Boone, said that was an important copyright principle that could prompt jurors to think differently about the case.Klausner also wrongly told jurors that copyright did not protect chromatic scales, arpeggios or short sequences of three notes, the ninth Circuit panel found.  “This error was not harmless as it undercut testimony by Skidmore’s expert that Led Zeppelin copied a chromatic scale that had been used in an original manner,” Paez said.The panel also found another jury instruction misleading.Francis Malofiy, an attorney for Skidmore, said in a statement his client faced “unfair rulings at the trial court level” and looked forward “to the challenge of a fair fight”.“Today, we are proud that three esteemed jurists from the ninth circuit recognized the battle that we fought and the injustice that we faced,” he said.One of the issues that came up at trial was that jurors could only listen to experts’ renditions of the sheet music for Taurus, not the recorded version of the song as performed by Spirit.Steven Weinberg, a copyright lawyer who watched the trial, said the sheet music for Taurus wasn’t faithful to the recording, so jurors could not fairly compare the songs.The ninth circuit in its ruling Friday said jurors should have been allowed to hear the recording to help establish that Page had “access” to Taurus, meaning he would have been familiar with it.Weinberg said a new jury will now get to hear a recording of Taurus.“I believe that ruling alone has the potential of changing the outcome at the next trial because the jury will finally get to compare ‘apples to apples’,” he said.

The bidding public disagreed and left the group in deficit.They attempted to claw back some cash by including a signed vinyl copy of their Different Class album with a vintage gramophone they were auctioning, but this also raised limited interest from bidders.Cocker, who bucked the show’s traditions by refusing to wear the typical branded polo shirts, said he had been “scarred for life” by his previous attendance at auctions. “I attempted to be in the antiques trade for about a fortnight. It didn’t really work,” he said.The Happy Mondays team ended the programme with a profit of £8 after buying a “vintage rustic novelty mirror” in the shape of a horse collar, a biscuit tin and a mid-century record player. But a member of the Bargain Hunt production crew noticed the winning bidder for two of their lots was Bez’s girlfriend, breaking show rules and forcing the ending to be reshot – with victory handed to Pulp.“It was a genuine error,” said Bez, who was made to pay the £8 profit out of his own pocket. “My girlfriend thought she was helping out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99b950480cd1fec1ccf3dc8a39bac44c25e1bc82/0_0_3500_2435/master/3500.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4a38f3b61308be55e98b5460aa43a1a","title":"food supplier suggests vegetarian dishes in case of no deal brexit","story":"Bidfood UK may not be able to source meat for care homes, schools, prisons and hospitalsOne of Britain’s biggest food suppliers to pubs, prisons and royal palaces has held talks with customers over switching to vegetarian dishes to avoid meat shortages that could be triggered by a no-deal Brexit.Bidfood UK, which is the sole provider of food served in prisons and also supplies schools, hospitals and care homes, has approached customers about changing their menu choices as part of contingency plans for border delays.With six months until the UK leaves the EU, growing numbers of companies are preparing for a no-deal Brexit against a backdrop of political turmoil and an impasse between London and Brussels. Firms fear that a collapse in the value of the pound could push up costs, that they could face a shortage of EU workers and that delays at British ports could hold up deliveries.Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, said the company had lined up additional warehouse space to stockpile food and drink and had discussed cutting down on meat options to avoid potential shortages.“A lot of meat products like chicken in the UK come from Holland and Poland, so, could you look at more non-meat dishes, vegan or vegetarian options?” he said.The prospect of meat shortages caused by a hard Brexit is reminiscent of Britain during the second world war, when the government encouraged families to bake vegetable Woolton pies as other meals became harder to prepare. About half of all food consumed in the UK last year came from abroad, with almost a third arriving from the EU.Bidfood uses about 1,000 trucks to make more than 12,000 deliveries from 24 depots across the country each week. Two-thirds of its 15,000 food items are domestically sourced, but Selley said a hard Brexit risked shortages of EU products including chips imported from Belgium, pasta and olive oil from Italy and meat from eastern Europe.Unless there is clarity over the political situation before Christmas, Selley said the company would be forced to order extra supplies before Britain exits the EU on 29 March. He said: “We’d need safety stocks in for some of those items, if we felt it was going to be a hard Brexit and we felt those border delays would happen.”According to a survey this week by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, whose members have to navigate import and customs procedures, as many as one in 10 UK firms fear bankruptcy in the event of a no-deal Brexit if it results in even relatively short port delays of up to half an hour. Deliveries of perishables such as food, drink and flowers would be most at risk because they could deteriorate while delayed in transit. A quarter of firms plan to stockpile supplies.HM Revenue and Customs has written to 145,000 firms who only trade with the EU to advise them of the risks of a no-deal Brexit. A spokesman said that its border staff had “well developed plans to ensure that on day one of a no-deal scenario there will be a functioning customs, VAT and excise system”.Businesses up and down the country are however starting to prepare for the very worst outcome, saying they have little choice.The fashion chain Next this week warned border delays could lead to higher prices in its shops and devoted 10 pages of a stock exchange update to explain its contingency plans. BMW plans to shut its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after the UK leaves next March, while Jaguar Land Rover has cut staff working hours. Honda has said a no-deal Brexit could add 60,000 extra pieces of paperwork for imports and exports to the UK while costing the firm tens of millions of pounds.Studies show small firms are less likely to have made preparations as “Brexit fatigue” sets in, although some are gearing-up for a no-deal scenario.Mark Bradley, who runs Digital Image Solutions, a printing business with an annual turnover of £2.5m, said he would stockpile raw materials at the firm’s Wolverhampton warehouse. The firm, which makes giant posters for Manchester City and branding for Virgin Active gyms, needs to protect against a sudden increase in the price of aluminium sheets, vinyl and LED lights from German and Irish suppliers.“We will increase stock, there’s no two ways about that. It just depends on how the negotiations go and the news in the next quarter as to how much we tie up in it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15ac8701bbce932b63fbaf93575dffdfeda8c6e/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91988971c0d60d326d125342201870bb","title":"theresa may tory grassroots brexit tension boils over","story":"Conservative constituency groups backed the PM after Salzburg, but many are livid about her Chequers planOn a Friday night at a Conservative club in a slightly run down part of Hornchurch in east London, local party members gathered for a pint, a round of darts and to chat about the week gone by. Around a table in the corner, under the watchful eye of portraits of the Queen and Winston Churchill, the local constituency chair, Bob Perry, sat with several of his members.As they sipped their drinks, the conversation turned to Brexit. Earlier in the day, Theresa May had issued a message of defiance from No 10, having been humiliated by the EU rejecting her Chequers plan at the end of the Salzburg summit.The activists were dismayed. “They’ve treated both her and us appallingly,” said Perry. “She’s been tough today but I don’t think she’s gone far enough. But my respect for the prime minister has grown after today. A lot of people say she doesn’t have a backbone, but I think she’s shown them wrong. She has my sympathy.”Sandy Scott, a retired accountant, added: “This is going to be a terrible year for her. She’s trying as hard as she can, but the way she was treated was despicable.”There was a general murmur of agreement from around the table. Even though the Tory party grassroots were furious about May’s Chequers plans, the EU appears to have overplayed its hand.The prime minister’s decision to metaphorically wrap herself up in the union flag with her message of defiance in the wake of Salzburg has achieved its aim, boosting her street cred with the Tory grassroots.“We just want to get through party conference,” said one Whitehall aide. “We had been hoping for warm words at Salzburg to tide her over, but we didn’t get them. So we had to pursue a different strategy.”Downing Street has been starkly aware of the danger posed by bringing together thousands of febrile MPs and party activists at a time when May’s Brexit strategy was still hanging in the balance.“It’s going to be difficult,” acknowledged one senior No 10 adviser. “The PM knows the country, let alone the party, is very polarised and that she needs to get on the front foot to address that.” Uniting the UK after Brexit was expected to be at the heart of her conference speech.Back in Hornchurch, which sits in the Brexit-supporting heartlands where London merges into Essex, it is clear that while the membership’s sympathy could get May through conference, she still faces fierce opposition over her Brexit plans longer term.Perry described her proposals as unworkable. Scott added: “She’s trying her best to get a deal but personally I’d rather have no deal than a bad deal … If this country had a chance and an opportunity it could look after itself. In the second world war we were feeding ourselves.”Elsewhere in the Tory party the atmosphere has been more hostile. In a wood-panelled private dining room at a members club in central London last week, the executive committee of the group Grassroots Conservatives met to discuss the government’s approach to Brexit.Afterwards, the group’s chair Ed Costelloe, a former constituency chair from Frome in Somerset, set out his concerns. “The government and the prime minister have utterly failed to explain how we can do international trade deals while also following EU rules and how will that work,” he said.“If you’re selling something, it doesn’t matter whether it’s a washing machine or a treaty, you’ve actually got to say this is how it works. We haven’t had any of that. I cannot understand what kind of politics it is that says ‘this is a great deal, I’m the PM, I say so’, and there it stops.”Grassroots, a campaign group not officially affiliated to the party, has been deluged by hundreds of emails and letters from activists worried that the prime minister was going to compromise still further with Brussels.“Most people cannot conceive a situation where Theresa May can give any more concessions without totally losing face in the party and the country,” said Costelloe. “Unhappy would be far too mild a word. The membership would be absolutely incandescent.”Delyth Miles, another committee member and former constituency chair from Wales, added: “She has categorically stated that she won’t move her boundaries this time. I want to believe her very much but the outcomes she’s selling to us just don’t make any sense to me and not to thousands of our supporters either.“In all my years as an activist and building up the profile of the Conservatives and the membership, I’ve never experienced such anger and sense of betrayal from people. She’s totally betrayed us.”Hostility towards May runs deep. Costelloe, who has chaired two different constituency associations and speaks regularly to local chairs across the country, believes it has its origins back in 2002 when she offended thousands of members by describing them as “the nasty party”.The options available to the membership, currently thought to be around 125,000 strong, were limited. Their only real power, beyond lobbying local MPs and threatening to withdraw financial and campaigning support, was the final say on who becomes their next leader.Costelloe said: “We’re not making a big stir because of this business of loyalty to the prime minister. We’re not campaigning to change the leadership. The question to ask is would the next general election campaign be led by Theresa May? That’s the key question because I think she has lost the trust of the average Conservative voter.”May’s departure has been widely regarded as a matter of when, rather than if, and activists have openly discussed who might succeed her. Brexiters Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson’s names come up the most frequently. In Hornchurch, Rees-Mogg will be the star guest at next month’s constituency dinner. Tickets sold out immediately.Others believed the party needed a fresh face, although they conceded May could hang on. Grant MacMaster, a 17-year-old student who has just joined the Hornchurch Tory association, said: “I’m moving towards somebody who isn’t particularly outspoken about Brexit because after Brexit I think there needs to be domestic consensus.”There has been deep frustration at local level at the party’s perceived lack of interest in the grassroots. “They don’t want to know. Talk to any Conservative association. Many will feel that CCHQ and a certain caucus in the upper echelons of the party hold the local associations more or less in total contempt,” said Costelloe.But they have a warning for the government. “They rely on us for financial support and our time but they need to remember we are also expressing the views of Conservative supporters in terms of voters. At the moment there’s real bitterness and frustration out there in the country,” said Miles.While they may feel dejected that the MPs harbour most of the power in the party, rumours of deselection of remainers to assert their authority seem wide of the mark. “There is a mechanism, but why would we want it?” asked Perry. “The possibility exists but it would be extremely rare,” Costelloe said.Tory MPs warned of the threat of entryism over the summer after the former Tory donor and Ukip backer Arron Banks urged thousands of Leave.EU supporters to “flood” the Tory party to elect a “true Brexiteer”, such as Johnson or Rees-Mogg. But the threat did not come to pass.“We have a new computerised membership system which would enable us to recognise a spike, and we haven’t seen one,” said one senior CCHQ official. “Banks is good at publicity but rubbish at logistics. I could be a teenager having a party at my parents’ house with 100 people and say there were loads of people. It’s all relative.”In Hornchurch, over another round of drinks, the group, which also includes Perry’s wife Carol and MacMaster’s mother Karen, agreed that despite the prime minister’s desire to strike a deal, they would prefer to crash out rather than accept Chequers.“We’d all love a deal but the deal has to be on our terms, not the EU’s terms,” said Perry. “I know he’s Ukip but Nigel Farage made a very valid point when he called them gangsters. These people are just bully boys.” The fragile truce in the wake of Salzburg could come to a brutal end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00ebbe870d457a486ebf26b6ebac37e54967e61b/0_50_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c81fea7fbc95e404f5d285a35dfae850","title":"leeds rhinos toronto wolfpack super league super 8s match report","story":"Toronto and Widnes do not have much in common at first glance, not least when their respective histories in rugby league are factored in. But on Sunday afternoon Canada’s largest city – or at least a small part of it – will be rooting on a small industrial town in north-west England to help fulfil the dreams nobody in the sport believed were possible two years ago.How the rugby league landscape scorned at talk from Toronto Wolfpack as they prepared to shake the sport to its core in 2016 when they declared Super League was the goal, preferably as soon as possible. But the Wolfpack have held up their end of the bargain and all eyes turn to Widnes’ trip to Hull Kingston Rovers to see if they are automatically promoted.The arithmetic is fairly rudimentary. If Hull KR win by 13 points or more, they claim the final automatic place in Super League for 2019. That would consign Toronto to next Saturday’s Million Pound Game, where the 12th and final top-flight place will be decided. If Hull KR do not, then Toronto are officially a Super League side. “We’re all Widnes fans now,” said their coach, Paul Rowley afterwards.Rowley and Toronto were indebted last night for this situation to their full-back, Gareth O’Brien, who kicked the winning drop-goal - just as he did two years ago in the Million Pound Game for Salford to consign Hull KR to the Championship for a 17-16 win. “Today is a memorable day and the biggest victory of our short existence,” said Rowley.As for Leeds, this was a defeat which summed up an insipid defence of the Super League title they won last October. They are safe from the Million Pound Game, which is at least something but the Rhinos were uninspiring and this was a firm reminder of the size of the task the incoming coach, David Furner, faces.“It’s hugely disappointing and it probably sums up our season,”said Kevin Sinfield, their director of rugby. “We survived, that’s the positive, but it’s pretty clear we need to make some changes.” Toronto led 12-10 at half-time after fine tries by Cory Paterson and Nick Rawsthorne, before Jimmy Keinhorst put the Rhinos ahead, Liam Sutcliffe converting to make it 16-12. However, after Matty Russell levelled the scores with a fine try, both sides turned to desperate attempts at drop-goals to snatch victory. Joel Moon and Josh McCrone each missed, before O’Brien obliged to seal a monumental victory. Toronto beating Leeds. Who in rugby league could have predicted that just two short years ago.Meanwhile three of Super League’s top four warmed up for next week’s play-off semi-finals with wins. The leaders, St Helens, comprehensively beat Castleford 28-0, with Man of Steel favourite Ben Barba scoring twice. The Saints face Warrington on Thursday and the Wolves prepared for that game with a 36-23 win at Wakefield. Wigan, who host Castleford, were 14-12 winners over Hull."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/704b6bc660ef442ca73c163604ee4754e8b57627/0_141_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5e86450a306eba00ae000e7ecd97ab6","title":"newcastle wasps premiership match report","story":"• Newcastle 22-23 Wasps• Wasps fight back from 22-13 behindA late Lima Sopoaga penalty snatched a 23-22 victory for Wasps at Kingston Park. The Falcons led 15-13 at half time and then 22-13 when Johnny Williams grabbed his second try, but a scorching 60th-minute score from Juan de Jongh converted by Sopoaga made it 22-20 and the Wasps fly-half then landed a crucial 45-metre penalty with eight minutes left for Wasps to clinch the points.In a climactic finish Newcastle ran the ball back out when Sopoaga missed another 45-metre shot with 59 seconds on the clock and they went through 20 phases and six minutes of overtime before their brave attempt to save the game foundered.Simon Hammersley, Toby Flood and Vereniki Goneva all made early breaks and it needed a very good tackle from Sopoaga to halt the Falcons full-back but Wasps got on scoreboard first with a 13th-minute try.Sopoaga missed a long-range penalty but his clever kick through set up a try for Josh Bassett which the referee, Karl Dickson, initially ruled out but then awarded after he checked with the TMO, Sean Davey.It looked as if Hammersley’s tackle had driven Bassett over the dead ball line but replays showed the winger had got the ball down in time to make it 5-0, Sopoaga missing the conversion.Newcastle hit back five minutes later with Sinoti Sinoti pinballing off defenders from Hammersley’s pass before finding Mark Wilson and the England forward rumbled in for his fourth try of the season.Flood tried a quick drop-goal attempt for the conversion – he missed it – which indicated there may have been some doubt about the 18th-minute try.Sopoaga did the same when Michael le Bourgeois appeared to have scored in the 23rd minute under the posts but Dickson stepped in, asked for the TMO who ruled there had been a knock-on and Wasps had to be satisfied with a penalty from Sopoaga for offside. Davey was called on again on the half-hour when Newcastle went to the corner three times with penalties and Johnny Williams eventually forced his way over.On review Davey awarded the try and Flood converted and then kicked a 36th-minute penalty for offside to make it 15-8, but Newcastle comprehensively failed to handle the restart, Wasps camping on the Falcons line, and from the resulting scrum Sopoaga threw an outrageous one-handed overhead pass for Marcus Watson to score in the corner against his former club to make it 15-13 at the break.A massive run from Gary Graham was carried on by Sinoti who was hauled down close to the line and Williams snapped it up to go in – again after the TMO was called in – and Flood converted for 22-13 in the 47th minute.It seemed Tom Penny had scored after Adam Brocklebank broke through and Goneva’s inside pass led to a touchdown but the TMO was involved again and it showed Penny was in touch.It was something of a turning point with Wasps dominating the possession which followed and a couple of breathtaking moves had the Falcons scramble defence stretched and eventually broken when De Jongh scorched over and Sopoaga’s conversion made it 22-20 in the 60th minute.The Wasps fly-half then kicked the 72nd-minute penalty from 45 metres when Newcastle started offside to put his side ahead 23-22 and Wasps held on in a frantic finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ab27e4388b443a41a735bcc8dcea255c0ee97b/0_214_2595_1556/master/2595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64d512c9b88d1fd5571e0d431214fa32","title":"rory mcilroy ian poulter ryder cup day one","story":"It was not Rory McIlroy’s morning. But it most decidedly was his afternoon. And, after the first two matches of the 2018 Ryder Cup, it just about was his day as well. He is a hero risen from the unfamiliar depths of mediocrity to look again like the golfer who owns four majors, and he will surely play a pivotal role in building on Europe’s surprise 5-3 lead going into day two.As Europe, down 3-1, struck back hard to blue-wash the Americans in the afternoon foursomes, McIlroy played the alternate-shot format with Ian Poulter for the first time, and the Englishman’s ever-bubbling personality seemed to lift the Irishman from the torpor that had gripped him in the morning.In the almost windless first session, McIlroy and Thorbjørn Olesen, the 28-year-old Dane making his Ryder Cup debut, were schooled by the world No 1, Dustin Johnson, and Rickie Fowler. But, when the afternoon wind carved viciously through this glorious course, McIlroy and Poulter gave Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson a pretty sound 4\u0026amp2 beating.Poulter, as emotional as ever at 42 (yet calmer since he ditched the loud trousers and garish tops last year), chipped in: “The second I got to the golf course I was OK. But the whole buildup? I didn’t have my best stuff in the practice rounds, two weeks off leading in. My mind … it’s been a long time since I played a Ryder Cup. Four years is a long wait. But the second I got going this morning, I felt good. It’s great to play with Rory. The buzz around the golf course is just incredible.“I left Rory a couple of seven-foot testers today and he managed to roll them in. It was a good match. The board looking so strong this afternoon, that’s key. The team have done what they do best and that’s be resilient. It’s awesome.”But what a contrast in performance and fortunes it was for McIlroy on day one. The linchpin of Europe’s last three winning campaigns was the only player of the 16 who jousted in the fourballs who failed to get a birdie.It is not often that McIlroy is anonymous on a golf course but, as the tumult gathered on the fairways all around him, he was almost invisible in Olesen’s shadow. Johnson and Fowler drew the sting from the Europeans in a tight front nine, recouped after going one down, then pulled away in the straight.Fowler was perhaps a little generous in his summary of a clear-cut win: “We knew what was going to be needed against Rory and Thorbjørn. They’re great ball-strikers, and we knew it was going to be a tough match.”Any notion that McIlroy would be the European playmaker dissolved on the front nine, Olesen coming to the rescue six times. The senior partner was roused to life briefly after the turn but did not find the after-burners in a one-sided finish.The alternate-shot format – as it is better known to the Americans – has inbuilt frustrations, given a player’s fortunes reside for half the time in the hands of his partner. One down within a few minutes, the challenge for McIlroy and Poulter looked to be considerable. Two down after three, the mound was growing into a hill. Then, a mood change: McIlroy drove beautifully to hand Poulter a gift on to the enormous green of the 486-yard 4th, stopping the rot, and, in a moment of old magic, he drove the 380-yard 6th to set up a birdie as they clawed back a precious hole.On the 7th, McIlroy found the gambling table with a curving approach shot. Roared to the blue skies by the blue-loving crowd, he smiled the smile, and they were back on level terms when the Americans failed to putt out.Poulter’s putter, normally his go-to weapon, was not firing consistently. Luckily, neither was Simpson’s, and McIlroy popped in a three-footer to take them one up, turning the foursomes scoreboard totally blue as they neared the turn.The Americans dragged one back on the par-three 11th but surrendered their little breakthrough immediately and, from there to the end, were never properly in the contest.On the 13th, McIlroy pulled off an extraordinary recovery shot, from well below his feet on the angled bank of one of the course’s many wet graves, and thrashed it on to the green for Poulter, who obliged from 15 feet with a fierce breeze tugging at the ball (after Watson had missed his birdie putt), and they led by three.As Watson said later: “That birdie they made on 13, where Rory hit it on the cliffs of the water and Poulter made it, that was a big turnaround. That could have easily gone our way, and they flipped it on us.”McIlroy drove big down the right with the aid of a crosswind on the 554-yard 14th, angled nicely for the double-tier green. His tidy chip left Poulter a great birdie chance, which lipped out, but, four from home, they were cruising.McIlroy, ignoring the 20mph headwind that ruffled his new haircut, went down two clubs and played safe to reach the 15th, sticking it long and left. He cleaned up the par, after Poulter’s neat, meandering distance putt dribbled downhill.The Americans were spent on the 16th, looking almost relieved to be out of the battle – but still in the campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2720751ccd64c6203dbe3429055d73493e1be876/0_276_3440_2064/master/3440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c86afd29a720199c5373fef2d7cae060","title":"big dance theater 17c review samuel pepys feminist scrutiny metoo","story":"Old Vic, LondonPepys’s celebrated diaries come under feminist scrutiny in Big Dance Theater’s postmodern mashupWhat’s the British slang for penis? The woman in the wig wants to know. She’s addressing the audience. Come on now, don’t be shy. After all, we’re here to talk about Samuel Pepys and he certainly wasn’t – masturbation, constipation and defecation are all recorded in his diaries. Those chronicles of Pepys’s daily life form the basis for director Annie-B Parson’s 17c, opening the Dance Umbrella festival.Dance Umbrella is 40 this year and on great form: still curious, still adventurous, still bringing over artists new to the UK, such as Parson’s New York troupe, Big Dance Theater. There’s less dance, more theatre in this show, as the multi-talented cast of five deliver slices of Pepys’s journal – alternately earnest, arch and sarcastic – then seamlessly mix in modern speech, video, song, and baroque-tinged dance. Especially good is the funny-boned Cynthia Hopkins (who does, in the end, learn a few new anatomical nouns), making Pepys’s thoughts sound like punchlines in a lame sitcom.At its best, 17c is a pacy, postmodern mash-up of history and commentary. We meet two modern-day Pepysians vlogging about their idol, disturbed by the revelations he was, as they say, a bit handsy. The material is ripe for feminist revision: here’s Pepys regaling of his affair with his maid in a gossipy confessional, but what of his voiceless wife, Bess? This show shines a light on her, lonely and betrayed (although the choreography with which Bess gets to reveal her inner life is not hugely illuminating).As Pepys gropes his way around London and assuages his guilt buying Bess new silks and lace, we see a pattern of serial adultery and control that starts to look distinctly unsavoury. Yes, yes, the standards of a different age – but also one more man whose legacy is tarred by sexual indiscretion. Can he absolve himself by justifying it on the page? Can we look past the behaviour of the man if we like his work?This is a show that rollicks along until we hit the serious stuff, and it’s a shame the energy dissipates because it’s clever and entertaining. A very 21st-century take on a 17th-century life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/645e8a30e1c77ac2aa4c37fc952cd51822a7030b/0_0_4461_2958/master/4461.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7a9c821985907af625f3de4da9b906aa 1760w","title":"jeff flake brett kavanaugh latest confirmation senate","story":"Move comes after Republican senator Jeff Flake threatened to oppose nomination without further examination of allegationsDonald Trump has directed the FBI to launch a supplemental investigation into the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, after an extraordinary display of 11th-hour drama at the Senate judiciary committee vote to advance his confirmation on Friday.Trump said in a statement that the updated investigation into his nominee for America’s highest bench “must be limited in scope” and “completed in less than one week”. However, he later suggested in a tweet that it was only a matter of time before Kavanaugh was appointed.Senate Republicans voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination despite a last-minute change of heart by a Republican senator, who broke ranks and called for an FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations that have roiled the judge’s confirmation process.Moments before the Senate judiciary committee voted 11-10, along strict party lines, to send Kavanaugh’s nomination to the floor for the full chamber’s consideration, Senator Jeff Flake announced he would support a “limited” FBI investigation and threatened to oppose Kavanaugh if there was no further examination of the allegations against him.“I think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to and not more than one week in order to let the FBI do an investigation,” Flake said at the hearing on Friday.Following Flake’s insistence, the Senate judiciary committee later said it was formally requesting that the Trump administration instruct the FBI to conduct a supplemental background investigation that would be “limited to current credible allegations against the nominee and must be completed no later than one week from today”.The decision marks a reversal for the administration, which had argued that Kavanaugh had already been vetted.The remarkable turnaround came hours after Flake announced his support for Kavanaugh despite dramatic testimony on Thursday that saw the supreme court nominee and Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who accused him of sexual assault, deliver dueling testimony on Capitol Hill.Flake, who had been regarded as a crucial swing vote, reversed course after he was confronted by two survivors of sexual assault in an elevator shortly before Friday’s committee vote.The confrontation with Flake could be seen in TV footage blocking the Arizona senator from closing the elevator door. Through her tears, one woman said she had been a victim of sexual assault, and begged Flake to look her in the eye. She said: “Look at me and tell me that it doesn’t matter what happened to me.”The gripping exchange appeared to have had an impact on Flake, who subsequently sat stone-faced in the committee room in anticipation of the vote. As his Republican colleagues took turns declaring their support for Kavanaugh, Flake abruptly left the room to engage in private discussions with Democrats on the committee.Nearly an hour of tense, closed-door deliberations followed, pushing the vote past its scheduled time. As members exited and re-entered the room several times, seeking to make sense of what was transpiring behind-the-scenes, Flake finally re-emerged before the committee and voiced support delaying a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh pending a FBI investigation.“We can have a short pause and make sure the FBI can investigate,” he said.According to her lawyer, Ford welcomed the FBI investigation, but said “no artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on it”.Kavanaugh said he had done “everything” the Senate had asked of him and “will continue to cooperate.”Thursday’s emotionally charged hearing underscored not only the potential ramifications of sending Kavanaugh to the supreme court, where he would play a role in shaping decades’ worth of policy, but also the societal impact of the #MeToo movement and recourse for victims of sexual assault.It remains unclear if Republicans possess the necessary votes from the full chamber to confirm Kavanaugh. With a narrow 51-49 seat majority in the Senate, Republicans can afford to lose just one vote.Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two of the Senate’s prominent Republican women, have remained undecided on Kavanaugh. Both senators on Friday afternoon expressed support for a limited FBI investigation following the committee’s announcement that it would seek one.Speaking to reporters earlier on Friday, Trump said he had not considered an alternative to Kavanaugh. But he did not escalate pressure on Senate Republicans to rally behind his nominee, stating: “They have to do what they think is right.”Also earlier in the day, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, had dismissed calls for a new FBI investigation, telling reporters Kavanaugh had already “been through six separate background investigations by the FBI”.Kavanaugh is a darling of the conservative right in America but his path to the supreme court has been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations from three women.Democrats have called for Kavanaugh to withdraw as more accusers have come forward. Following Kavanaugh’s fiery testimony on Thursday, several Democrats voiced concerns over his suitability for the historically independent supreme court.Senator Dianne Feinstein, the judiciary committee’s top Democrat, said the judge had been “aggressive and belligerent”.“I have never seen someone who wanted to be elevated to the highest court in our country behave in that manner,” she said.Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, lamented the committee was no longer independent.He said: “We are an arm, and a very weak arm, of the Trump White House.”Red-state Democrats facing tough re-election battles in November, some of whom crossed over the aisle last year to confirm Trump’s other supreme court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, also appeared to feel the heat. At least two of them, Senators Jon Tester of Montana and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, announced they would vote against Kavanaugh on Friday.“As I have made clear before, sexual assault has no place in our society,” Donnelly said in a statement.“When it does occur, we should listen to the survivors and work to ensure it never happens again. That should not be a partisan issue.”Joe Manchin, a vulnerable Democrat up for re-election in West Virginia, endorsed Flake’s position.Meanwhile, there were signs the remarkable testimony had registered negatively with at least two organizations whose endorsement Kavanaugh had earlier received.The American Bar Association, which previously gave Kavanaugh its highest rating of “well qualified”, asked the Senate judiciary committee and the full Senate to delay the vote until the FBI could do a full background check."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a5314db778a7ec3e742c47fc2d05fa33dcebb5d/0_14_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ff36ba480f6a274985d04c07474d5c5","title":"kavanaugh testimony candace owens dana loesch response rightwing republican women ","story":"Republicans call the supreme court nominee a ‘hero’ and think his anger over the sexual assault accusations reflected their ownBrett Kavanaugh’s testimony angrily denying sexual assault allegations galvanized many in the Republican party, who rallied to his defense.Many women around the country, meanwhile, were riveted by the words of his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, some recalling their own traumas or the history of powerful men getting away with mistreating women.The fate of the nominee may rest with two female Republican senators, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who had both remained undecided on Friday. However they indicated that they supported Senator Jeff Flake’s call for a one-week delay on a floor vote, after the judiciary committee moved the nomination forward.Reaction to Thursday’s momentous hearing was starkly ided along partisan lines, and many right-leaning women echoed the views of the rest of their party.“Brett Kavanaugh is a hero. I implore our Republican congressmen to confirm him, NOW,” Candace Owens, communications director for Turning Point USA, a conservative student organization, said on Twitter, also adding: “Kavanaugh has me on the brink of tears.”Radio host and National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch said that to torpedo Kavanaugh would usher in a “new standard of not being judged by your competency as an adult, but by your fart jokes and beer drinking as a teenager (as no evidence has materialized to prove true any of these claims).”Kavanaugh’s angry demeanor, she said, was justified. “People get mad when you lie about them, smear their character, threaten their families, and they have every right to feel that way ... Kavanaugh is deservedly and righteously hurt and angry. He’s fighting,” she tweeted. “How should a man sound after his name and reputation have been wholly trashed, his wife and daughters threatened, due to still unsubstantiated accusations?”“What we have witnessed in these last couple of weeks is just a travesty,” Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor at the conservative online magazine The Federalist, said on Fox News. “We did not have any additional supporting evidence today. Any at all.”For some, the hearing inspired a more nuanced reaction. Nancy French, a conservative Christian writer, said the testimony brought her to tears.“As a sex abuse survivor, you feel marginalized your whole life – like no one is listening to you,” she told Time. “But as the senators interrupted her testimony to grandstand every five minutes, it slowly dawned on me that the culture holds sex abuse survivors in less esteem than I thought. They perceive us to be less than nothing ... We are political pawns, elevated when we fit the narrative, ignored when we don’t.”And Jennifer Rubin, a conservative blogger and MSNBC contributor, said Kavanaugh came off as a “deeply, deeply partisan man”.“By all means, keep screaming and pounding the table. But men shouldn’t be in public office if they’re going to get hysterical,” she tweeted, adding his demeanor added credibility to the sexual assault allegations. “With him screaming and interrupting senators I could imagine him putting his hand over someone’s mouth.”Commentator and columnist S.E. Cupp said that after watching Ford testify, she thought: “This is over - this is devastating.”That changed after Kavanaugh took his turn. “The anger that he showed ... the frustration, the anxiety, indeed the tears, the raw emotion, was what a lot of voters – I think a silent majority – wanted to see,” she said Thursday on CNN. “Their anger was reflected by Brett Kavanaugh.”Fox News contributor Sara Carter also saw Kavanaugh’s performance swaying people to his side.“I think the American people saw for the first time, really saw what was happening to this man, what was happening to Judge Kavanaugh and his family,” she said on the network. “When we hear this man cry out and say, look at what you have done to my family. Look at what you’ve done to our nation. Is this what we’re going to do to each other? I think at that point the country took a step back and people were swayed by Kavanaugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75fcc1eb41abcebf287243bd1b876b6771a5d752/0_203_4344_2606/master/4344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9665ab86c75f7efe95a2bed43e8cc843","title":"woman accuses washington lawmaker ford testimony joe fain","story":"Republican state senator Joe Fain denies allegation of committing sexual assault 11 years agoA woman has accused a Washington state lawmaker of raping her 11 years ago, saying she was inspired to speak out as she watched the televised allegations against supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The lawmaker has denied the claim.Candace Faber said in a tweet that Republican state senator Joe Fain sexually assaulted her in 2007 the night she graduated from Georgetown University in Washington DC. He was not in office at the time at the time of the alleged assault.“I’m done being silent,” she wrote.Fain said he “absolutely” denied the allegation and called for an investigation.In a text message to the Associated Press, he said: “Any allegation of this serious nature deserves to be heard and investigated for all parties involved. I invite and will cooperate with any inquiry.”Fain, 37, was first elected to the Washington state Senate in 2010, three years after the alleged incident. He is a moderate Republican from the Seattle suburb of Auburn and currently the state Senate minority floor leader.Faber said later in a statement that she was inspired by Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychology professor who told the Senate judiciary committee on Thursday that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers. Kavanaugh has fiercely denied Ford’s claims.“Like Dr Ford, I can no longer remain silent knowing that the man who raped me is in a position to influence the laws that govern my state and impact every woman who lives here,” Faber wrote.Faber, 35, published an online essay in June accusing an unnamed Washington state lawmaker of assaulting her in 2007. She wrote how they met “at the Capitol” after she graduated from Georgetown in Washington DC, spent the night dancing and kissing, and that both “drank too much”.She wrote in the essay that she walked the man back to his hotel, went to his room and that he pinned her to a bed and pulled down her dress. She wrote that she told him to stop and put her foot on his head to push him away. After the man raped her, she wrote, she asked him for a kiss goodbye before leaving the room.In her essay, she rejected that the kiss request was “not how girls act when they’ve been raped”. She wrote that she later called a friend, wondering if she should go to a hospital.Faber said in her statement on Thursday that she did not make the man’s name public earlier because she thought she “could change the culture of sexual assault without needing to say his name” but no longer believed that to be the case.She declined a request to be interviewed and did not respond when asked by email if she had filed a police report.The statute of limitations for most serious sex crimes in Washington DC is 15 years.In interviews with KUOW-AM in Seattle, Faber’s mother and a former colleague at the University of Washington said Faber previously claimed Fain raped her. The co-worker, Frank Martinez, told the public radio station that he knew Faber was struggling with her mental health at the time but he believed her allegation to be credible.In his text message, Fain asked people to “show respect” to Faber and to the process. He did not respond to a message seeking additional comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b29082534b0e691380c8cc0e238dca3117c9450/0_12_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45214caace58d27630030a97f6236772","title":"melting arctic ice opens new route from europe to east asia","story":"A Danish ship has successfully completed a trial voyage through the Russian ArcticA Danish-flagged cargo ship has successfully passed through the Russian Arctic, in a trial voyage showing that melting sea ice could potentially open a new trade route from Europe to east Asia.The Venta Maersk made the journey as a one-off trial, said Palle Laursen, the chief technical officer of A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s biggest shipping group.The ship, carrying a cargo of frozen fish, arrived in St Petersburg on Friday, after leaving Russia’s Pacific port city of Vlaostok on 22 August.“The trial allowed us to gain exceptional operational experience,” said Laursen, adding the ship had performed well in the unfamiliar environment.The Northern Sea route could be a shorter journey for ships travelling from east Asia to Europe than the Northwest Passage over Canada because it will likely be free of ice sooner due to climate change.Experts say it could reduce the travel distance from east Asia to Europe from the 21,000 kilometres (13,000 miles) it takes to go via the Suez Canal, to 12,800 kilometres (8,000 miles). This would cut transit time by 10 to 15 days.It’s not the first time a cargo vessel has completed the Russian Arctic route, and Maersk underlined that the journey was “to gain operational experience in a new area and to test vessel systems”.“Currently, we do not see the Northern Sea route as a viable commercial alternative to existing east-west routes,” Laursen said.“Today, the passage is only feasible for around three months a year which may change with time. Furthermore, we also must consider that ice-classed vessels are required to make the passage, which means an additional investment.”During the 37-day journey, Maersk was “in close and regular dialogue” with Russian authorities and ice breaker companies as precautionary measures.The company said the vessel which made the trip is among the world’s largest ice-class ships specifically designed to operate in cold waters.

Thick roots are entwined around fallen lintels. Elsewhere, the stonework is still daubed with orange plaster.“Imagine – there are lots of buildings left to discover in the forest,” he said. “And beyond, in the mountains: who knows?”The sprawling ruins are, scholars agree, the last capital of Vilcabamba: a holdout Inca state that resisted for decades after the conquistadors landed in Peru in 1532, executed the emperor Atahualpa, and occupied the Inca capital of Cusco.Forgotten for centuries, the city of Espíritu Pampa – also known as Old Vilcabamba – has only been cleared in recent decades.And the latest findings, a new site museum and fieldwork both scheduled for 2019 – along with the pending completion of a road through Vilcabamba – are bringing attention to the last stronghold of the Incas once more.Architect and explorer Vincent Lee first mapped out Espíritu Pampa in detail in the 1980s, when the region was under the control of brutal Shining Path guerrillas.“It was a step back into the 19th century just to go there – and a potentially dangerous one,” he said.The jungle “was so thick one could hardly see one building from the next,” Lee added.Today, three government workers use machetes to keep the foliage at bay from a palace compound, the remains of a huge hall with 26 doorways, and a labyrinth of rooms, streets and stairways. “The area is fascinating because it still hasn’t been disturbed or looted. The information is firsthand,” said Javier Fonseca, an archaeologist with Peru’s ministry of culture.“It’s the last capital of Inca resistance,” he added. “It has history, it has archaeology, it has everything. It’s genuinely a marvel to work in this place.”Four successive Incas ruled in Vilcabamba, venerating the sun, engaging in diplomacy and guerrilla warfare with the Spanish – and inspiring rebellions beyond their mountain refuge.Facing an overwhelming invasion in 1572, the Incas set the city ablaze and fled into the forest. The Spanish captured Peru’s last indigenous monarch Túpac Amaru I and executed him in Cusco, bringing the Inca empire to an end. Espíritu Pampa was swallowed up by the jungle.Yet recent research points to a far older origin for the site – and to a web of connections linking Vilcabamba with its European and indigenous neighbours.In one sector of Espiritú Pampa – dominated by towering matapalo trees that grip the ruins – Fonseca pieced together a unique ceramic vessel depicting Andean and Amazonian peoples, backed up by jaguars, united in battling the mounted conquistadors.Perhaps the most intriguing discoveries at Espíritu Pampa concern the Wari – a predecessor culture to the Inca that ruled swaths of Peru between 600 and 1100AD.In 2010, Fonseca identified a sumptuous Wari burial complex near the main site. One occupant – dubbed the Lord of Wari – was found with a silver mask, breastplate, axe blades and ornaments, golden bracelets and dozens of finely crafted vessels.And late in 2017, Fonseca identified a Wari temple nearby, containing both Inca and Wari gold and silverwork.“This society doesn’t disappear overnight. Part of the Wari inheritance survives, thanks to the Incas,” he argued.These cross-cultural finds are currently ided between minor exhibits and storage units, Fonseca lamented, but there are plans to build a museum in Vilcabamba in 2019.The Cobos family would like to see it established in Huancacalle, the small village by Vitcos from where explorers have long set out on foot for Espíritu Pampa.But some fear this buccaneering tradition is coming to a close. Archaeologists are currently mapping the Inca path – to avoid any damage from a highway due to be extended into the valley below.The new road is eagerly awaited by some Vilcabamba residents, mainly Quechua-speaking smallholders who barter potatoes, yuca, coffee and cuy (guinea pigs) to get by.Even if it becomes more accessible, the last city of the Incas will still inspire wonder, and new techniques such as Lidar mapping may soon reveal the true extent of the city beneath the forest canopy.“I’m sure there’s a great deal more to uncover,” said writer and explorer Hugh Thomson.Benjamín Cobos, 90, agreed. As a boy, the Machiguenga peoples that lived at Espíritu Pampa told him of yet another city, even deeper in the forest.“They said you have to walk for five days, along a wide Inca road,” he added. He once followed a barefoot indigenous guide, scrambling up densely wooded slopes for hours.“But, because I didn’t care about ruins then, I turned back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ba8f416ba951bdd1d450b2b153a2ed0cc55b4fc/0_269_3892_2335/master/3892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c69ba4668c1af2cd4500d8a12dd73cc","title":"saudi foreign minister demands canada stop treating it like a banana republic","story":"Adel Al-Juebir escalates row, asking for apology from Trudeau’s government over tweet calling for release of jailed activistsSaudi Arabia’s foreign minister has demanded Canada stop treating it like a “banana republic” and called upon the government of Justin Trudeau to apologize for calling for the release of jailed human rights activists, further escalating a simmering diplomatic row that began over the summer.“You can criticize us about human rights, women’s rights … that’s your right. You can sit down and talk about it, but demand the immediate release? What are we, a banana republic? Would any country accept it?” said the foreign minister, Adel Al-Juebir, at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, as world leaders gathered forthe United Nations general assembly.Al-Juebirreferenced a tweet sent by Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, calling for the release of jailed activists Samar Badawi and her brother, Raif Badawi. Raif Badawi’s wife and children are Canadian citizens.It was a separate tweet of the same content, but translated into Arabic and sent by the Canadian embassy in Riyadh, that in August prompted a wave of anger from the Saudi government, culminating in the expulsion of Canadian diplomats, the near-cessation of trade and the removal of all Saudi medical students from Canadian universities.In his comments on Wednesday, Al-Juebir also attempted to return the criticism, alluding to issues of separatism in French-speaking Quebec and Canada’s treatment of indigenous communities.“It is outrageous, from our perspective, that a country will sit there and lecture us and make demands – we demand the immediate release. Really? We demand the immediate independence of Quebec. We demand the immediate granting of equal rights to Canadian Indians,” he said.“We don’t want to be a political football in Canada’s domestic politics. Find another ball to play with. It’s very easy to fix. Apologize and say you made a mistake.”Earlier in the week, Freeland had expressed optimism that the two countries would be able to mend what has become a fractious relationship.Freeland has previously refused to apologize for the comment and on Tuesday, reiterated her support for the activists.“Canada will always stand up for human rights … we feel a particular obligation to women who are fighting for their rights around the world,” she said on Tuesday, before the Saudi request for an apology. “And we feel a particular obligation to people who have a personal connection to Canada.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/182f4b297be0c558aac6a00a74aa7758dc8361d7/136_218_3364_2020/master/3364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7706827ce85b0afb1c83f4a7f42a381b","title":"amal clooney urges aung san suu kyi to pardon reuters journalists","story":"Human rights lawyer calls on Myanmar’s Nobel peace laureate to step in to ‘correct an injustice’Prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has appealed to Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to pardon two Reuters journalists imprisoned in Myanmar, saying the Nobel peace laureate held the key to their release.Clooney, speaking at a press freedom event at the United Nations, sought to link the former iconic status of Suu Kyi as a human rights champion to the request for the release of Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, and Wa Lone, 32.The two fathers, accused of breaching Myanmar’s state secrets law while reporting on a massacre of Rohingya Muslims, were jailed for seven years earlier this month, fueling international outrage.Clooney said the reporters were arrested in an attempt by Myanmar to keep Reuters from publishing a story on the extrajudicial killings of 10 Rohingya men and boys. She noted that Suu Kyi had once “allowed young people to hope for a free Myanmar that respected the rule of law”.“She knows that mass murder is not a state secret and that exposing it doesn’t turn a journalist into a spy,” Clooney said of Suu Kyi. “She has said that one political prisoner is one too many, and so we’re hopeful that since these are the principles that she herself has espoused, she will step in and try to correct an injustice in this case.”About 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh amid a brutal military campaign in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Myanmar’s army is accused of mass rape, killings and setting fire to thousands of homes in the aftermath of an August 2017 attack by Rohingya militants on security outposts.“They should be worrying about whether or not they’re going to win the Pulitzer prize, not whether they can get out of prison any time before 2024,” Clooney said of the reporters. She said their families have asked the government for the pardon, which would have to be granted by the country’s president in consultation with Suu Kyi.Suu Kyi has rejected criticism over the show-trial conviction earlier this month. “The case has been held in open court,” Suu Kyi said. “If anyone feels there has been a miscarriage of justice, I would like them to point it out.”An email seeking comment from Myanmar’s mission to the UN wasn’t immediately answered.Stephen Adler, the president and editor-in-chief of Reuters, said his reporters’ arrest “was clearly aimed at unmasking Reuters sources and keeping us from publishing the account of the massacre.” He called the attack on the reporters “a chilling warning” to other journalists worldwide.“We know about the massacre because they did what good reporters do,” Adler said. “Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo went with open minds and left with facts. Except they didn’t really get to leave, did they? Only the facts did. In an astonishing miscarriage of justice, our reporters were set up and arrested.”Rohingya Muslims have long been treated as outsiders in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. The discussion Friday was arranged by the Committee to Protect Journalists, which also highlighted the repression and abuse of reporters in countries including Bangladesh, Egypt and Kyrgyzstan.The Reuters case has drawn worldwide attention as an example of how democratic reforms in long-isolated Myanmar have stalled under Suu Kyi’s civilian government, which took power in 2016. The country had been under military and military-backed rule for more than five decades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71aed1e69e788feca2b316ce0ba308e17685e47f/0_137_6394_3837/master/6394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5dcd539cfda3f8823d634744d00e732","title":"new york review of book ian buruma jian ghomeshi","story":"A controversial piece by Jian Ghomeshi in the New York Review of Books cost editor Ian Buruma his job and sparked a debate about free speechFor decades, the New York Review of Books has enjoyed a reputation as the most important intellectual publication in the US, a home for complex and challenging ideas.This week, the stately magazine has been capsized after choosing to publish a highly contentious piece by the former broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi, who has been accused of sexual assault by more than 20 women.Ghomeshi’s article will not be printed until 11 October but it has already cost editor Ian Buruma his job, prompted a detailed apology from the NYRB’s publisher, ided the staff at its West Village office and generated a storm of criticism which has drawn in some of the biggest names in the literary world.One of the women who accused Ghomeshi of attacking her told the  she was distressed by the article in which, she said, her alleged attacker tried to elicit sympathy and gave a false account of the legal process.“This is so self-absorbed that I don’t know how this could be published and not cause an outrage,” Linda Redgrave said.Ghomeshi was fired from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2014 after multiple complaints of harassment, which included allegations of hitting, biting and choking during sex. He was acquitted in one criminal trial and a second criminal case did not proceed after he signed a “peace bond” and gave one woman a public apology.In his article for the NYRB, Ghomeshi attempts to “inject nuance” into his story and says “there has indeed been enough humiliation for a lifetime” before ending his account with a “reformed character” anecdote about meeting a woman on a train. He apparently claims ethical credit by describing how he did not try to seduce her.Redgrave, who waived her right to anonymity after the first criminal trial, said of Ghomeshi’s article: “I had not seen this coming. I suspected that he wasn’t going to go away disgracefully, but it caught me off stride and I was really upset by it. There really wasn’t any apologising, it was trying to just evoke sympathy for something he doesn’t deserve.”After reading the piece online, she contacted Buruma and demanded to write a rebuttal. He agreed and she filed her account the day before he left the NYRB. She has since been assured that her rebuttal will be published in the 25 October edition as part of a pledge by the magazine to devote “substantial space” to responses to the Ghomeshi article.Asked if she thought Buruma should have lost his job, Redgrave said: “Yes I do. There is an ethical line you don’t cross. I think he crossed the line. This was something he did knowing that it was going to have this result. He knew that this was wrong, he did it anyway, he deserved to be fired.”The article, published online earlier this month, has attracted little conspicuous public support. But the “enforced resignation” of Buruma has ided observers. The affair has also illuminated some of the most difficult questions of the moment:This week, a letter with 109 signatories, including authors Colm Tóibín, Joyce Carol Oates and Ian McEwan, was sent to the NYRB. It said: “We find it very troubling that the public reaction to a single article, ‘Reflections from a Hashtag’ – repellent though some of us may have found this article – should have been the occasion for Ian Buruma’s forced resignation.“Given the principles of open intellectual debate on which the NYRB was founded, his dismissal in these circumstances strikes us as an abandonment of the central mission of the Review, which is the free exploration of ideas.”The letter was coordinated by writer and academic John Ryle and drafted and edited by a core group of 15 contributors. A source with knowledge of how the letter was brought together said it was first distributed via email last Sunday and more than 100 prestigious contributors to the NYRB were given 24 hours to sign or decline.A second source with knowledge of the letter, who also declined to be named, said: “There was an intense process of revision. I do not know how many of the signatories think that publishing the piece was an error of judgment. The phrasing of the letter embraces those who do think this and those who do not.“It affirms that, either way, the signatories do not think that there was a justification for summary dismissal … this is a difficult situation, with strong feelings on all sides. But it is clear to me that an injustice has been done to Ian Buruma.”Buruma, 66 and described to the  by one supporter as “a terrific public intellectual”, claimed in an interview with the Dutch magazine VN he had been “convicted on Twitter, without any due process”. He said be felt compelled to resign, after just over a year in post.The letter from authors and writers in support of him was made public the day after a detailed statement was released by the NYRB’s publisher, Rea Hederman, rejecting the allegation that public outcry alone was responsible for Buruma’s departure.“We acknowledge our failures in the presentation and editing of his story,” Hederman said, citing editorial lapses including a failure to bring female members of staff into the editing process. “We surely had a duty to acknowledge the point of view of the women who complained of Mr Ghomeshi’s behaviour.”The publisher’s statement said many of the editorial staff objected to Buruma’s claim in two interviews that staff came together after initial objections to the piece.“Finally, it is inaccurate that Ian Buruma’s departure was the result of a ‘Twitter mob’,” the statement said. “In fact before his departure, the mob mostly had moved on.” contacted a number of the signatories to the supportive letter. Joyce Carol Oates said by email she totally agreed with critics of Ghomeshi’s essay, but said: “I thought that terminating Mr Buruma’s contract so abruptly was not a good, or necessary decision. Mr Buruma (whom I don’t know) is a distinguished critic, writer, editor who is certainly to be defined by far more than a single misstep. We would all wish to be given a second chance.”Fintan O’Toole, literary editor of the , who signed the letter, said the published piece was very poor and Buruma should not have said that the truth of the allegations was not his concern.“So the issue for me isn’t whether he was right or wrong – to me he was clearly wrong. It’s whether one bad incident justifies the sacking of an editor who is very widely agreed to have been doing a very fine job. If editors are sacked the first time they make a mistake, we’ll end up with nobody in charge of vitally important publications except ultra-cautious hacks.”The rights and wrongs of the piece and Buruma’s fate split other commentators.Rebecca Solnit, author of Men Explain Things To Me, said: “There are two things that are really outrageous. The first is to give a platform to somebody who appears to have so violated the rights of others and the rights, the dignity, the safety of the bodies of other human beings.“And the second is to violate all normal editorial standards not only to publish a piece that’s profoundly dishonest and misleading about what happened but to also, according to reports, deny the longtime women editors the rights to have a look at it.”She added: “I believe the women who made allegations against Ghomeshi and to lose their voices out of the story and let him tell the stories in ways that contradict what they told us: it treats what he has to say as important and true and treats what they have to say as unimportant and irrelevant.”Gerald Howard, an executive editor at publisher Doubleday, said the NYRB was “immensely important to American intellectual life, which always feels on the edge of disappearing”, but publishing the article was an editorial misfire.But Howard said of the enforced resignation of Buruma: “I really disapprove. I feel that he was taken down by a mob and did not deserve it.“The thing that especially upsets me is that apparently there was all this pressure from university presses who said they were going to withdraw their ads from the Review because of publishing this piece, which just makes steam come out of my ears.”Jay Rosen, who teaches journalism at NYU and writes the blog PressThink, said: “A piece that was that provocative and was going to be looked at very closely, because it’s unusual for the New York Review to do something like that, it just needed to be more solid than it was.”He said it would be a tragedy if the NYRB was to begin shying away from publishing controversial subjects, “but it is not clear that’s what happened. It’s a valid concern about ideas being shouted down on social media and publishers not wanting the cost of that. I’m not saying it’s relevant to this piece but it is something to worry about – it’s good that writers are worried about that.”Speaking on background because they were not authorised to comment publicly, a member of NYRB staff said most co-workers were relieved the editor had gone, having been concerned about some of his decisions.In an editorial meeting, objections were raised about the Ghomeshi piece: about its tone and style, about its lack of insight and about the way it misrepresented the allegations against him. After publication, the source said, some staff expressed longstanding concerns to the publisher.It was distressing Buruma’s departure had become a free-speech issue, the source added, saying it was really about managerial and editorial shortcomings."},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsToday\u0026rsquos graduates want more from work than just the pay chequeStudents are well-positioned as the growing economy increases employment demand for graduatesHow can graduates make sure they\u0026rsquore appreciated and what do their bosses expect in return?Personal ethics can be a guiding factor for graduates considering job offersFrom science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryHow graduates can make sure they are skilled-up and job-readyEmployees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesInternational companies raise employee expectations of what a modern office should look likeAnxiety, stress and depression are the second highest causes of work-related illness in IrelandTeam-working, creativity and problem-solving are in demand among hiring managersWhat is likely to pay off the most \u0026ndash investing in furthering your education or starting your career instead?Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsInternships can be an effective way to gain work experience and increase your employability \u0026ndash but is there a downside?Jobseekers can take steps to maximise their chances of getting hiredHow employers use interviews to gain an understanding of what makes people tickAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interview"},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

He said many victims were still to be accounted for.Indonesia tsunami in pictures: Big waves leave Sulawesi coastline in ruinsBodies of victims were found in several places, because they were hit by the rubble of collapsing buildings or swept away by the tsunami ... but we are still collecting data, Sutopo said earlier on Saturday.There were also fears for hundreds of police and attendees at a beach festival that was taking place around the time the tsunami struck. Around 250 officers who were securing the event were missing, local news site Kompas  reported. Suddenly the first earthquake occurred, followed by panic and some people fled from the beach, one witness called Adrian told the website. After that, we saw water suddenly crashing, and finally there was a big panic. Not having time to escape, there was a bigger earthquake, and suddenly the water rose.Palu,  built around a narrow bay that apparently magnified the force of the tsunami waters, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.In the nearby city of Donggala a large bridge ning a coastal river had collapsed.Indonesian TV showed a smartphone video of a powerful wave hitting Palu, with people screaming and running in fear. The water smashed into buildings and a large mosque that collapsed under the force.Houses were swept away and families were reported missing, Nugroho said, adding that communications and power to the area were disrupted.The cut to telecommunications and darkness are hampering efforts to obtain information, he said. All national potential will be deployed.Helicopters had been deployed on Saturday morning to assess the damage and provide assistance.The region was rocked by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday and numerous strong aftershocks, including one of magnitude 6.7. An earlier magnitude 6.1 quake in central Sulawsi killed several people, injured 10 and damaged dozens of houses.Medical team members help patients outside a hospital after an earthquake and a tsunami hit PaluThe chief of the meteorology and geophysics agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, said the tsunami waves were up to 10 feet high, while the disaster agency said the waves  reached a maximum height of five feet.She said the tsunami warning triggered by the biggest quake, in place for about half an hour, was lifted after the tsunami was over.The situation is chaotic. People are running on the streets and buildings have collapsed.

He said many victims were still to be accounted for.Indonesia tsunami in pictures: Big waves leave Sulawesi coastline in ruinsBodies of victims were found in several places, because they were hit by the rubble of collapsing buildings or swept away by the tsunami ... but we are still collecting data, Sutopo said earlier on Saturday.There were also fears for hundreds of police and attendees at a beach festival that was taking place around the time the tsunami struck. Around 250 officers who were securing the event were missing, local news site Kompas  reported. Suddenly the first earthquake occurred, followed by panic and some people fled from the beach, one witness called Adrian told the website. After that, we saw water suddenly crashing, and finally there was a big panic. Not having time to escape, there was a bigger earthquake, and suddenly the water rose.Palu,  built around a narrow bay that apparently magnified the force of the tsunami waters, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.In the nearby city of Donggala a large bridge ning a coastal river had collapsed.Indonesian TV showed a smartphone video of a powerful wave hitting Palu, with people screaming and running in fear. The water smashed into buildings and a large mosque that collapsed under the force.Houses were swept away and families were reported missing, Nugroho said, adding that communications and power to the area were disrupted.The cut to telecommunications and darkness are hampering efforts to obtain information, he said. All national potential will be deployed.Helicopters had been deployed on Saturday morning to assess the damage and provide assistance.The region was rocked by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday and numerous strong aftershocks, including one of magnitude 6.7. An earlier magnitude 6.1 quake in central Sulawsi killed several people, injured 10 and damaged dozens of houses.Medical team members help patients outside a hospital after an earthquake and a tsunami hit PaluThe chief of the meteorology and geophysics agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, said the tsunami waves were up to 10 feet high, while the disaster agency said the waves  reached a maximum height of five feet.She said the tsunami warning triggered by the biggest quake, in place for about half an hour, was lifted after the tsunami was over.The situation is chaotic.

It further pushes Mr Kavanaugh’s confirmation into uncertainty.Jeff Flake, speaks during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about an investigationThe key moment in Mr Flake’s change of heart appeared to be when he was confronted in a lift by two victims of sexual assault who demanded to know why he was supporting Mr Kavanaugh. “Don’t look away from me. Look at me and and tell me that it doesn’t matter what happened to me!” said one woman, speaking through tears as she kept the lift door open. The scene lasted around four minutes. The drama on Capitol Hill played out the day after Mr Kavanaugh, 53, and Christine Blasey Ford, a 51-year-old California professor who accuses him of sexual assault, both gave emotional testimony about the allegations. On Thursday, Prof Ford said she was “100 per cent” sure that Mr Kavanaugh was the person who drunkenly pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes at a high school house party in the summer of 1982. However Mr Kavanaugh categorically denied the claim and angrily lashed out at a flurry of allegations he has faced late in the confirmation process, saying the proceedings had become a “national disgrace”. Two other women - Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick - have also gone public to claim Mr Kavanaugh committed sexual misconduct during his student days. Neither woman has given public testimony. Mr Kavanaugh has denied both claims. Hanging in the balance is a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, which comes with the chance to shape American society for generations to come. After Thursday’s emotional hearing - which was broadcast live on television channels and watched by millions - it was time for senators on the committee to vote on Friday. Mr Kavanaugh faced two hurdles. First to get approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee, made up of 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, then to win a vote from the full US Senate. Mr Flake, the one Republican who was wavering on the committee, announced on Friday morning that he would be voting for Mr Kavanaugh, infuriating liberals and effectively confirming the committee would approve the nominee. Christine Blasey Ford testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on ThursdayHowever minutes after issuing a press release announcing the decision he was confronted by two women who said they had been sexually assaulted and were demanding an explanation for his stance. “You have two children in your family. Think about them,” said one woman, fighting back tears. “What are you doing sir? This is the future of our country.”Another shouted: “Look at me when I’m talking to you! You’re telling me that my assault doesn’t matter, that what happened to me doesn’t matter and that you’re going to let people who do these things into power.”Later that day, just moments before the committee was due to vote, Mr Flake left the room. He huddled with Democratic senators and appeared to be reconsidering his decision. Then he announced a change in position. Mr Flake said he would vote through Mr Kavanaugh at the committee stage but demanded a delay in the full Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI investigates - matching a key Democratic demand. Mr Flake said: “This country is being ripped apart here, and we’ve got to make sure that we do due diligence. ... I do think we can have a short pause and make sure that the FBI can investigate.”After the comments a vote was held and the committee approved Mr Kavanaugh’s nomination.  Donald Trump, the US president, bowed to pressure and ordered the FBI investigation. Just days earlier he had said the FBI did not want to look at the claims. He said in a statement that the inquiry must be limited in scope and be completed in less than one week. Mr Kavanaugh confirmed in a statement that he would cooperate. All credible allegations are expected to be looked at. It is unclear whether that means all three women who have publicly made allegations will be interviewed. Ms Ford\u0027s lawyer, Debra Katz, welcomed the FBI investigation and thanked the senators who pushed for it but decried the limits imposed on it. A thorough FBI investigation is critical to developing all the relevant facts, Ms Katz said.Before Flake\u0027s move, committee Republicans voted down a Democratic motion seeking to subpoena Mark Judge, a Kavanaugh friend who Ms Ford said witnessed the assault. Mr Judge had told the committee in a written statement he does not recall any such incident.

It further pushes Mr Kavanaugh’s confirmation into uncertainty.Jeff Flake, speaks during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about an investigationThe key moment in Mr Flake’s change of heart appeared to be when he was confronted in a lift by two victims of sexual assault who demanded to know why he was supporting Mr Kavanaugh. “Don’t look away from me. Look at me and and tell me that it doesn’t matter what happened to me!” said one woman, speaking through tears as she kept the lift door open. The scene lasted around four minutes. The drama on Capitol Hill played out the day after Mr Kavanaugh, 53, and Christine Blasey Ford, a 51-year-old California professor who accuses him of sexual assault, both gave emotional testimony about the allegations. On Thursday, Prof Ford said she was “100 per cent” sure that Mr Kavanaugh was the person who drunkenly pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes at a high school house party in the summer of 1982. However Mr Kavanaugh categorically denied the claim and angrily lashed out at a flurry of allegations he has faced late in the confirmation process, saying the proceedings had become a “national disgrace”. Two other women - Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick - have also gone public to claim Mr Kavanaugh committed sexual misconduct during his student days. Neither woman has given public testimony. Mr Kavanaugh has denied both claims. Hanging in the balance is a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, which comes with the chance to shape American society for generations to come. After Thursday’s emotional hearing - which was broadcast live on television channels and watched by millions - it was time for senators on the committee to vote on Friday. Mr Kavanaugh faced two hurdles. First to get approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee, made up of 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, then to win a vote from the full US Senate. Mr Flake, the one Republican who was wavering on the committee, announced on Friday morning that he would be voting for Mr Kavanaugh, infuriating liberals and effectively confirming the committee would approve the nominee. Christine Blasey Ford testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on ThursdayHowever minutes after issuing a press release announcing the decision he was confronted by two women who said they had been sexually assaulted and were demanding an explanation for his stance. “You have two children in your family. Think about them,” said one woman, fighting back tears. “What are you doing sir? This is the future of our country.”Another shouted: “Look at me when I’m talking to you! You’re telling me that my assault doesn’t matter, that what happened to me doesn’t matter and that you’re going to let people who do these things into power.”Later that day, just moments before the committee was due to vote, Mr Flake left the room. He huddled with Democratic senators and appeared to be reconsidering his decision. Then he announced a change in position. Mr Flake said he would vote through Mr Kavanaugh at the committee stage but demanded a delay in the full Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI investigates - matching a key Democratic demand. Mr Flake said: “This country is being ripped apart here, and we’ve got to make sure that we do due diligence. ... I do think we can have a short pause and make sure that the FBI can investigate.”After the comments a vote was held and the committee approved Mr Kavanaugh’s nomination.  Donald Trump, the US president, bowed to pressure and ordered the FBI investigation. Just days earlier he had said the FBI did not want to look at the claims. He said in a statement that the inquiry must be limited in scope and be completed in less than one week. Mr Kavanaugh confirmed in a statement that he would cooperate. All credible allegations are expected to be looked at. It is unclear whether that means all three women who have publicly made allegations will be interviewed. Ms Ford\u0027s lawyer, Debra Katz, welcomed the FBI investigation and thanked the senators who pushed for it but decried the limits imposed on it. A thorough FBI investigation is critical to developing all the relevant facts, Ms Katz said.Before Flake\u0027s move, committee Republicans voted down a Democratic motion seeking to subpoena Mark Judge, a Kavanaugh friend who Ms Ford said witnessed the assault. Mr Judge had told the committee in a written statement he does not recall any such incident. He is likely to be central to any FBI probe.Mr Judge\u0027s lawyer said he would cooperate with the FBI or any other law enforcement agency.Separately, the US president said that Ms Ford had been a “very credible” witness but also praised Mr Kavanaugh’s testimony as “incredible”. Mr Trump added: “I just want it to work out well for the country.

They proved so popular, it was hard to take them down. Women of all shapes and sizes grinned from the walls on their bikes: Muslim women with headscarves tucked under helmets, mothers with children strapped on\u0026nbspchild seats. Most were wearing wet-weather gear. This is Glasgow, after all.“So many people engaged with these portraits,” says Shgufta Anwar, a development officer for Bike for Good, a social enterprise that gets people cycling. “I think they were so popular because we’re trying to normalise women on bikes in the area and it isn’t the norm, at the moment.”Anwar runs many of the programmes out of Bike For Good’s community hub,\u0026nbspwhich opened in May last year\u0026nbspon Victoria Road on Glasgow’s Southside. The organisation was founded by Greg Kinsman-Chauvet after he learned to ride a bike\u0026nbspaged\u0026nbsp30 and found it to be a life-changing experience. He liked cycling so much he moved to Glasgow, sold his car and quit his job to volunteer.The charity arm of Bike for Good started with a small stall in Barras Market in July 2010, teaching people the mechanics of the bike and how to cycle safely. It has since expanded to include a for-profit social enterprise that makes money refurbishing bikes and selling them on. Anything that can’t be used is stripped and sold on as parts, to stop as many bikes and parts as possible from going to landfill.\u0026nbspBike for Good now employs more than 50 people. It is one of several cycling organisations in Glasgow working to meet the Scottish government’s target: for bikes to be used for 10 per cent of journeys made by\u0026nbsp2020, up from the current figure of 2 per cent. (As things are, hitting that target will take 350 years.)But there are positive signs on the front line. The Southside branch of Bike for Good is already outgrowing its premises and looking to relocate to somewhere larger. The main reason it needs more space? More bikes. For most, the key barrier to cycling is not owning a bicycle.\u0026nbspNextbike, a rental city bike scheme, offers over 500 bikes at 63 stations across the city for an annual fee of £60. This is too pricey for many. So Bike for Good joined with other cycling organisations in the city to offer loan bikes for £3 to refugees and other communities on Southside. It tops up the Nextbike supply with its own refurbished loan bikes, which have grown in number from 10 to more than 40.“For some people £60 is nothing, but for some people £60 is everything,” says Anwar. Then there are other barriers. Some people live or work far from the bike stations, others don’t have a smartphone to make the rental or good enough English to understand the process. Bike for Good worked with the other cycle groups to find interpreters to speak to potential cyclists. They welcome newcomers into the Southside hub to hire the bikes, rather than forcing people to sign up\u0026nbspon the phone. The work is ongoing. In its first phase of the project, surveys showed some people without financial barriers were taking the cheaper bikes. Now they are looking at targeting specific groups.\u0026nbsp“We’re also running training because a lot of people lack confidence on the roads,” says Anwar.\u0026nbsp“It’s not just, ‘Here’s a bike, off you go’, it’s support for them as well.”Govanhill is the most erse neighbourhood of Scotland, with more than 50 languages spoken across just 13 housing blocks. It is also the focus of the South City Way, a £6.5m\u0026nbspinvestment by the Scottish government into improved cycle paths to connect different parts of the city and promote cycling as an environmentally friendly, healthy activity. Anwar and the Bike for Good team now have a big job on their hands: to encourage the erse communities of Govanhill to believe that cycling is for them.“One particular culture barrier we had was clothing. People don’t want to wear Lycra, they want to be able to cycle in whatever they wear,” says\u0026nbspAnwar. Most of the Bike for Good fleet are step-through bikes with a low bar. “The ladies love these bikes, particularly for the Muslim and Asian communities because they’re wearing something a bit looser and longer on their figure.”Uber to shift focus to electric bikes and scooters for short tripsHow e-bikes make you feel like you\u0027re incredibly good at cyclingLack of bike lanes \u0027putting off more than half of potential cyclists\u0027Pedal Pathways, Bike for Good’s cycling group aimed at women, has now worked with more than\u0026nbsp200 women from across Glasgow. Sixty per cent of those surveyed said their health and wellbeing had improved thanks to the sessions, which can include yoga, bike maintenance, healthy food and, of course,\u0026nbspa bike ride.\u0026nbsp“The majority of people that come into us with barriers are ladies,” Anwar says. “Some of them are estranged, some of them are not talking to anyone other than their family members, or they’re migrants, they might have been through horrific experiences. The social aspect is really important.”For some of these communities, cycling is something people do if they can’t drive, Anwar says. “People say, ‘Now we have cars, why would you cycle?’” she says. “So you have to get them to think of the health aspect and the environment aspect. It’s about getting people to realise that at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what you look like, you’re all the same underneath and you’re there for a common purpose, which is to ride a bike.”bike for goodShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The loyalty penalty is clearly unfair – 89 per cent of people think it is wrong.

The power should always be in customers’ hands and it is often more straightforward than people think to access better value across many household bills.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Therefore, we intend to vote against Unilever’s proposed resolution.”Investors should not despair – Unilever can still stay in the FTSE 100Unilever hikes idend and announces €6bn share buy-backLondon may be losing Unilever’s HQ but it must not lose its sharesUnilever, which has been based in Britain for almost a century, reviewed its dual-headed corporate structure in the aftermath of an attempted $143bn takeover from Kraft Heinz last year, as Dutch laws offer more comprehensive protections against hostile takeovers. Bosses have since tried to convince investors that their proposed Dutch incorporation will “create a simpler, more agile and more focused company”.Unilever needs at least 75 per cent of votes of London-listed shareholders in order to get the green light for an exodus from the capital.Mr Sadan added: “As a supportive shareholder in Unilever for more than 25 years, we have engaged with the company on a number of issues including its decision to unify its corporate structure. \u0026nbspWe asked the company to ensure that any approach they take safeguards the ability of our clients to maintain their investment and benefit from Unilever’s continued success.”LGIM’s decision to vote against the relocation plans of the UK’s third largest company mirrors the opposition expressed by other shareholders, including Brewin Dolphin, Lindsell Train and Columbia Threadneedle.Nicla Di Palma, equity analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said: “We aren’t convinced that the move will realise tangible benefits for shareholders and plan to vote against.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The loyalty penalty is clearly unfair – 89 per cent of people think it is wrong. The CMA needs to act now to stop people being exploited,”\u0026nbspTalkTalk most complained-about broadband and landline providerBritain must get out of the slow lane when it comes to broadbandA\u0026nbsp super complaint can be made by any government-designated consumer group in order to ask regulators to investigate an issue or practice working against the public interest.\u0026nbspThe CMA confirmed that it would investigate the complaint together with the Financial Conduct Authority and Ofcom and would publish a response within 90 days.FCA ​chief executive Andrew Bailey said Citizens Advice had raised a number of important points.“We expect firms to look after the interests of all customers and treat them fairly, whether they are new or long-standing,” he said.“It is important to get the balance right so that existing customers do not miss out on the benefits of competition and innovation, including when they purchase or renew their general insurance products.\u0026nbsp“The general insurance market study we have announced will help us examine the issues we have already identified in the market in more detail.”Richard Neudegg, head of regulations at uSwitch, said: “Citizens Advice is right to highlight that vulnerable consumers can often end up paying too much on their bills because there isn’t enough support from companies to ensure they get a fair deal.\u0026nbsp“While there are some schemes to financially support these customers in different sectors, these can be difficult to access and don’t have to be available through all providers.“As always, being switched on about the cost of your bills and taking action when companies’ offers aren’t good enough can lead to savings running into the £100s every year. The power should always be in customers’ hands and it is often more straightforward than people think to access better value across many household bills.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

Excavations at the site in 2017 revealed underground structures which held babies bodies with ages ranging from 35 weeks to three years old with most of the dead buried in the 1950s when the facility was run by the Bon Secours Sisters, a Catholic religious order of nuns who received unmarried pregnant women to give birthAn aerial view of the crowd at Phoenix Park Children queue for communion during Pope Francis\u0027 closing MassThe Stand4Truth rally gathers outside a former Magdalene laundry in Dublin as part of the demonstrations against clerical sex abusePope Francis leads the Holy Mass at Phoenix Park Pope Francis arrives to celebrate the Holy Mass at the Phoenix ParkThe names of the victims are read out as a vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby homePope Francis leads the Holy Mass at Phoenix ParkA member of the clergy carries a bowl of incense A vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babiesMembers of the public pray as they watch Pope Francis deliver a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families at Phoenix ParkPope Francis attends the closing Mass at the World Meeting of Families at Phoenix Park in DublinPope Francis passes by a banner of a protester as he leaves St Mary\u0027s Pro-CathedralPope Francis speaks during his visit to the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless in DublinPope Francis waves to the waiting crowds on ChristchurchPope Francis waves to the waiting crowds on College GreenMembers of the public wave at Pope Francis as he travels through the cityPope Francis laughs as he leaves St Mary\u0027s Pro Cathedral during his visit to DublinTwo boys wave flags after climbing a post as they wait for Pope Francis Pairs of baby shoes are hung from black ribbons on Gardiner Street in Dublin in memory of the children who died at the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, Co GalwayCrowds on O\u0027Connell StreetPope Francis memorabilia on sale on O\u0027Connell StreetPope Francis arrives at St Mary\u0027s Pro-Cathedral during his visit to Ireland to attend the 2018 World Meeting of FamiliesPope Francis waves to the waiting crowds on O\u0027Connell StreetPope Francis addresses the congragation at St Mary\u0027s Pro-CathedralStephen O\u0027Brien selling bottles of holy water from the St Mary\u0027s Pro Cathedral A man waves a rainbow flag behind a model of a pope which stands in the window above a bar People hold a banner against Pope Francis on the way to St Mary\u0027s Pro-CathedralNuns wait by the side of the road for Pope FrancisA model of a pope is placed in the window above a bar as crowds wait for Pope Francis to travel through the cityCrowds on O\u0027Connell Street, Dublin waiting to see Pope Francis as he travels in the PopemobilePope Francis waves to wellwishers as he arrives at Dublin AirportHis visit, the first by a Pope since John Paul II\u0027s in 1979 is expected to attract hundreds of thousands of Catholics to a series of events in Dublin and KnockPope Francis talks to journalists aboard a plane flying from Fiumicino aiport to DublinLGBT protestors from Dublin Pride and We Are Church with flags and umbrellas on Ha\u0027Penny Bridge, Dublin to remember the victims of clerical sex abuse ahead of the start of the visit to Ireland by Pope FrancisPope Francis disembarks from the aircraft as he arrives at Dublin AirportWoman wait for Pope Francis to drive past, in DublinTaoiseach Leo Varadkar delivers a speech watched by Pope Francis in  St. Patrick\u0027s Hall at Dublin CastleProtesters hold banners during a demonstration against clerical sex abuse, in DublinPope Francis plants a tree during a meeting with Irish President Michael D Higgins, at Aras an UachtarainPope Francis walks with the President of Ireland Michael Higgins at Aras an UachtarainPope Francis, center, is flanked by Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, right, as they arrive to meet authorities, in DublinProtestors wearing baby shoes, to signify the children who died in mother and baby homes in Ireland, protest in Dublin ahead of the start of the visit to Ireland by Pope FranciPope Francis exchanges gifts with Irish Prime Minister Leo VaradkarPope Francis speaks with President Michael D Higgins in his study during a visit to Aras an Uachtarain in Phoenix Park, DublinNavy band march prior to the arrival of Pope Francis at the Presidential residence in DublinEddie McGuinness from Dublin LGBTQ Pride carries a rainbow flag across Ha\u0027Penny Bridge, Dublin ahead of the start of the visit to Ireland by Pope FrancisA message left by Pope Francis in the visitors book at Aras an Uachtarain in Phoenix ParkJust beside the small church, I found the shallow well, still encircled by limestone, still filled with lightly running water. A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But NOA\u0027s pitch is that it\u0027s not a competition at all, and that audio can be about showing off some of the best traditional journalism in an entirely new setting.While audio is perhaps the oldest of all forms of media, the ways it is being delivered to people isn\u0027t at all. The advent of Amazon\u0027s Alexa, for instance, heralded an entirely new form of listening within the home, favouring on-demand cuts of information that can be requested by shouting while doing the washing up traditional radio still exists but it is increasingly being delivered over the internet when people ask, rather than as traditional broadcast.And the growth of ways to listen has come with an expansion of the listening public, too. With on-demand audio, people have come to see (or hear) that there are various times of the day that go largely unfilled, and it\u0027s apps like NOA – as well as other major audio companies like Audible – that are rushing into stop them being so silent.Amazon Alexa will now listen for strangers in your houseNOA works in a relatively simple way: its team take the best of their partners\u0027 written content, have a narrator record it, and push it out into the world. Its audience can then listen however and whenever they want, simply by opening up the app on their phone or asking Alexa to do it for them.The great thing about it is the time you have each day to consume visual content is limited, says Gareth Hickey, co-founder and CEO at NOA. You might take a quick look at a screen in the morning, and an hour or two in the evening. And that time can be filled up not just with news or other media like on demand television and Netflix, but also social media, emails and WhatsApp.Audio, however, doesn\u0027t have to compete: it can be done while driving, walking, exercising or doing something else entirely, and so can be a complement rather than distraction.About half of NOA\u0027s consumption comes between 7am and 9am. That gap in the day there just gets a lot of traffic – it\u0027s people that are usually commuting.There are of course many companies vying for that time too, many of them new. Everything from the shortest podcast to the longest of Audible\u0027s audiobook is intended to take on that market.But there is an awful lot of that time, too, and it is often spent doing a variety of different things. That means that companies like NOA seeing themselves as complementing podcasts rather than challenging them.That\u0027s useful become some companies like the New York Times have invested heavily in podcasts.They try much own that experience, and they\u0027re doing a great job with that. They\u0027re putting a huge amount of thought and time into getting that right.Instead, NOA focuses on the traditional articles that continue to do so well for those publishers. It is not about the kind of lengthier chats that often make up the meat of podcasts, but rather taking the quality content that news organisations are already producing it and recording it so people can listen to it another way.The style of content that we tend to lean more and more towards is the opinion, analysis, features, he says. The kind of articles that you might come across on a busy Monday afternoon and might not have the time to read.When people do come to those articles, they tend to spend a decent amount of time: about 85 per cent of people coming to an article will finish it, and they\u0027ll stay for an average of four-and-a-half minutes.NOA, of course, has some of the same struggles as every other news publisher. One of them is ensuring that people feel they can make their way through the vast amount of information that\u0027s out there in a way that\u0027s comprehensive and meaningful – without feeling completely overwhelming.One of the things we\u0027re moving towards has been an attempt to bring finish-ability to news topics, he says. It\u0027s all very well reading one piece about Brexit or business or whatever else, but with those huge issues it cane difficult to know where to start or where to end.One approach that NOA has been taking is to gather those topics up into playlists. One about electric cars, for instance, might include a more general overview on the industry, a e into the cobalt shortage that is threatening the batteries that power them, and a look at the latest scandal Tesla and Elon Musk have become embroiled in.It all helps to make people feel like it\u0027s possible to reach the end of the news, even if it\u0027s just to find that some more news has happened. When there is such an often overwhelming amount of stories – and stories about those stories – NOA like other more traditional publishers in seeking ways to cut through the noise.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They were sent back over a distance of around 180 million miles.They come after the space agency successfully landed two rovers on the asteroid, dropping them from a spacecraft floating just above the surface.The rovers dropped down onto the asteroid by the Hayabusa-2 spacecraft are the first mobile exploration robots ever to land on an asteroid\u0027s surface. The images they are sending back are the first time that anything has ever autonomously moved and taken pictures themselves on asteroid, too.One of the pictures includes the shadow of the antenna and pin of the rover itself.​ The pin – which is the long line that can be seen sticking out of the rover – helps increase friction when they engage in the hops that they use to jump around the surface, among other purposes.Jaxa, the Japanese space agency, says that both of the rovers are in good condition and are transmitting images and data. The pictures they are sending back have confirmed that they are moving themselves around the asteroid\u0027s surface.The rovers will spend their time exploring the planet\u0027s surface by being joined by yet another visitor,\u0026nbspcalled Mascot, built by scientists in Germany and France, that will further explore the surface.The new pictures are the second batch to be sent down by the\u0026nbspHayabusa-2 spacecraft. The first were taken as the two rovers tumbled to the surface, and show their whirling motion as they fall.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Those microorganisms could have been able to survive for hundreds of millions of years on the ancient planet.“We showed, based on basic physics and chemistry calculations, that the ancient Martian subsurface likely had enough dissolved hydrogen to power a global subsurface biosphere,” said Jesse Tarnas, a graduate student at Brown University and lead author of the study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. “Conditions in this habitable zone would have been similar to places on Earth where underground life exists.”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

They cannot get energy from sunlight, so instead peel electrons off molecules in the environments that surround them.Nasa reveals what it plans to do with water on the MoonAround four billion years ago, Mars would have had the same conditions that sustain huge numbers of microbes down on Earth today.The researchers are clear that the findings don\u0027t definitively mean that alien life existed on Mars. But they are important evidence that if life did get started there it would have been able to sustain itself.By combining\u0026nbspa range of different data about the red planet, scientists found that it probably had a habitable zone that stretched for kilometres deep and all around the world. It would have existed for hundreds of millions of years.Scientists now hope the findings can be used to inform future trips to Mars that will attempt to find evidence of alien life.“The mission of the 2020 rover is to look for the signs of past life,” Mustard said. “Areas where you may have remnants of this underground habitable zone — which may have been the largest habitable zone on the planet — seem like a good place to target.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I called the Home Office every month, but the only answer I’d get is it is it’s ‘in progress’.“He died and I couldn’t see him. I was suicidal in that week.”In another case, Noory Ahmad, who fled the war in Iraq in 2000, had to wait five years for a decision after claiming for asylum in the UK in 2003. During this time, he was unable to work and claim benefits, meaning he spent\u0026nbsplong periods of time homeless.With no passport or status, the 43-year-old was also unable to leave the country, meaning\u0026nbsphe couldn’t see his parents when they got ill.“It was a nightmare for me. I lost my dad, and a few years later I lost my mum, and I wasn’t able to see either of them,” he said.\u0026nbspNoory\u0026nbspAhmad waited five years for a decision after claiming for asylum (Noory Ahmad)“I wasn’t allowed to work, I had nowhere to live, no support, I wasn’t allowed to study.

I went from house to house, from city to city.”Once Mr Ahmad\u0026nbspwas granted indefinite leave to remain in 2008, he managed to move on with his life, and now lives in Coventry with his partner and two children, but he feels years of his life were “wasted”.It comes amid mounting criticism of\u0026nbspthe Home Office’s hostile environment policies following the Windrush scandal, which exposed that thousands of Commonwealth citizens had been wrongly targeted by immigration officials, with some detained and deported.Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott condemned the government for\u0026nbsp”not prioritising the delays at the Home Office despite the reduction in the number of applications being processed”.“It is unfair and unacceptable to leave applicants waiting for long periods, concerned for their futures,” she added.Immigration barrister Jan Doerfel\u0026nbsptold The Independent\u0026nbspthe figures were “of considerable concern” and raised\u0026nbspthe question over whether the delays were being\u0026nbspused to deter valuable migrants as part of the hostile environment.“The human costs of delay in terms of stress and uncertainty on applicants and their families is enormous and the Home Office service standards of six months to determine applications is already unacceptably long,” he said.“The reduction of delays should be rendered a priority and not be used to deter migrants who make a valuable contribution to the UK as part of the hostile environment.”The data shows that in the first six months of 2018, one in 20 people (2,618) who received decisions had waited for more than a year in 2017, compared with 1,792 (1.9 per cent) in 2014.A total of 221 decisions took more than two years, with 13 claimants waiting for more than a decade and one case taking 29 years.The Home Office said the majority of delays occurred on “non-straightforward” or “complex” cases, but experts said the department was increasingly using this reason to delay decisions for long periods of time.Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said: “We’re seeing the waiting time go up in all manner of immigration cases.\u0026nbspIt’s all too common to see people waiting for two years or more on these applications.“Saying the case is ‘complex’ is often used as a convenient way to delay them for long periods of time.“We’ve seen people who are changing jobs or have been on maternity leave unable to get back into the workplace because they don’t have the right papers. These people are also unable to access public funds. It’s an entirely unnecessary waste of not only time, but people’s lives.”Chai Patel, legal director of policy at the JCWI, highlighted that the delays were causing people to face separation from loved ones and to\u0026nbspreturn to deadly danger, and the destruction of the friends, family groups, and homes they’ve found in the UK.He continued: “It’s very easy to be bored by delays and missed targets in the Home Office. You have to remember that in each case a person –\u0026nbspa father, a mother, a child – is waiting in limbo for a decision that will alter the course of their whole life and potentially that of their family as well.\u0026nbsp“Every additional day of waiting is agony, and the Home Office needs to wake up to that.”To obtain UK settlement – which grants the right to remain in the UK without a time limit – a person must usually either have lived in the country for more than five years or have a close family member settled in the country.

But he never got to meet his granddaughter\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA man who has lived in the UK for more than a decade says he has\u0026nbspbeen made to feel “suicidal” after waiting for more than two years for the Home Office to process his settlement application.Mushtaque Shah\u0026nbspand his wife Sehar, both Pakistani nationals who have lived in the UK for 12 years and have a British-born daughter, applied for indefinite leave to remain in May 2016. They are still waiting for a decision from the Home Office 28 months later.The family, who live in Newcastle,\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspbeen unable to visit terminally ill relatives before they died as the Home Office is holding onto their passports, meaning\u0026nbsptheir three-year-old was never able to meet her grandfather.They are one of thousands of households impacted by increasing\u0026nbspdelays in the Home Office’s processing of settlement applications.New figures obtained by\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspshow the proportion of UK settlement applications forced to wait longer than six months has more than doubled in three years, from 6 per cent – or 5,627 – to 11 per cent, or 8,210.Mr Shah, 37, told The Independent: “Last year, my wife’s father was on his death bed, and we\u0026nbspcouldn’t make plans to visit. My father-in-law used to call and he ask when we were coming.“He would say: ‘I’m waiting for my granddaughter to pick her up and cuddle her.’ My wife would say next week, next week. But he never got to meet her.“My wife\u0026nbspwouldn’t eat for days she was crying all the time. Sometimes she would say: ‘I don’t want our visas –\u0026nbsplet’s just get our passports back and leave this country.’\u0026nbspBut we’ve paid our taxes and been here for 10 years.”Mr Shah, who owns a small company,\u0026nbspsaid that as well as being unable to see his wife’s father on his deathbed, he was unable to see his uncle when he got ill.“He raised me until the age of 18 he was like a dad to me. I called the Home Office every month, but the only answer I’d get\u0026nbspis that it’s ‘in progress’. He died and I\u0026nbspcouldn’t see him. I was suicidal in that week,” he said.Windrush citizens still waiting for cases to be resolvedIn June 2018, more than two\u0026nbspyears after\u0026nbspthe family submitted their application, they received a letter from the Home Office stating that their case was taking longer than usual because it was “complex”.Mr Shah said his family’s life was “on hold”.“I have been legal and respectful to the law. The Home Office is clearly not upholding my legal rights. They are not making any decision, which is even more frustrating than them rejecting my visa,” he said.“If there is a clear evidence against me getting a visa – which I don’t believe there is,\u0026nbspbut if there is –\u0026nbspthen they should tell me.

Absolutely.”The EU sees Brexit talks as Britain’s ‘managed capitulation’The comments are the strongest evidence yet that moderate Tories are flexing their muscles to prevent Theresa May carrying out her threat to allow the UK to crash out of the EU if necessary.Some senior cabinet ministers are also believed to be alarmed that the UK could end up facing a no-deal Brexit “by accident” and want the prime minister to adopt looser, Canada-style\u0026nbsptrade proposals as a fallback.Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme, Ms Rudd warned hardline anti-Brexit Tory MPs that continuing to obstruct Ms May’s efforts to reach an agreement in Brussels could backfire on them.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think no deal will happen,” she said, arguing a Norway-style EEA deal\u0026nbsp– effectively keeping the UK in the EU single market – remained a possibility.And she said: “It would be ironic indeed if we got a people’s vote because the more Brexity people in my party were unable to support the prime minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“So I think they have to think very carefully about the consequences of not supporting a negotiated settlement.”The Independent has launched its Final Say campaign, to give the British people the crucial decision on any Brexit deal.

I did have it in the back of my mind\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsBrodkin hands Theresa May a fake P45, on stage in Manchester last year On Wednesday 4 October 2017, two people woke in their hotel beds in Manchester with a certain trepidation about the day ahead.One had been struggling with a bad cold, a cough and a sore throat for almost a week. She had a long and important speech to give, a speech on which the morning papers claimed her job depended, and that job was prime minister.The other had a less lofty undertaking laid out before him, but it was a matter of life and death.Tories take aim at May ahead of party conference: ‘Stuck in the past’“I was flicking through the papers,” says Simon Brodkin, the doctor-turned-comedian-turned-professional prankster who, armed with a Conservative Party conference lanyard and a mocked-up P45 was about to make a small bit of British political history. “I was seeing a lot of pictures of snipers on rooftops. A lot of men with guns. Tensions were running high in the country at that time, and terrorists do make a prankster’s job that much harder.”Brodkin has got plenty of previous of this kind of stuff, on the England football team, on Kanye West, Manchester City, Sepp Blatter and Donald Trump, but this was something altogether more ambitious.“But this was different. There was so much tension around. I didn’t know if she’d have rules, you know, like, if you get within a certain perimeter of the prime minister, that’s it, it’s a code red, you go down. I did have it in the back of my mind.”P45 to Theresa May during conference speechBoth characters would end that day’s drama very much alive, albeit with\u0026nbspone having suffered the worst day of their professional life,\u0026nbspwhile the other enjoyed what was probably the best. Both performances\u0026nbsphad been a long time in the planning.\u0026nbsp“With the stunts that I do, you’re always looking for a target. You want to punch up, and there’s no more up than the most powerful person in the country, although that day, and in the many months since, she has seemed like anything but,” he says.“She had called that election on ‘strength and stability’, and it had all been utterly undermined. It just felt that there was this groundswell of public opinion, that it might be time for her to move on. That was what I felt the temperature was like at the time.“I just thought, ‘Oh my God, imagine handing the prime minister of this country a P45.’ That just made me smile. It represented the mood of the country. And then I thought, ‘Oh, hang on, if we can make that P45 from Boris Johnson it felt like tying all those things up together.”\u0026nbspIn the minutes, hours and now almost a full year since, people have complained about the “security risk” Brodkin posed to the prime minister. That “anything could have happened”, but that is far-fetched. “How did this idiot manage to get to within a few feet of the prime minister?” people have breathlessly asked. But the answer is straightforward.“Once you have an idea for a stunt it’s worth working out whether it can be done, where it can be done, how it can be done. And the conference started to feel like there could be the potential there. She’ll be making a speech, she’s up by herself. I thought, ‘Well how am I going to get access to the conference?’“And there is a very simple answer to that question. I applied online, under my own name. It was just a normal, boring application.”To watch the speech back now, it is clear Theresa May is struggling with her voice\u0026nbspright from the start. In fact, she had been struggling badly with a cough during her interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show three days beforehand.It has since been suggested it was Brodkin’s intervention, and the heightened nerves it engendered, that rendered the prime minister unable to speak. It’s also been said that the rousing applause that greeted his ejection unsettled the magnets on the backdrop, causing them to fall off moments before the end.She had just begun a passage attacking Jeremy Corbyn when Brodkin rose from his seat.\u0026nbspHe is certainly right that tensions were high. I was in the room myself, in the far corner, 50 yards or so to the prime minister’s right, in seats reserved for the travelling Westminster press pack. Most of us us had witnessed something highly traumatic out of our office windows just six month before.When a bizarre and eerily silent commotion started occurring at the front of the stage, and something was clearly going awry though nobody knew what, there was a palpable sense of fear and dread.No one was really paying attention to the giant screens above the prime minister’s head, where in the bottom corner, a shaky piece of paper appeared, with the letters P45 writ large in the bottom corner.Brodkin can be heard saying, “Boris told me to give it to you.”As Theresa May finally takes the piece of paper, desperate to to get rid of him, she loses it.\u0026nbsp“It’s the Conservative Party that has a vision of an open, global, self-confident Britain,” she says. Then adds: “While our opponents flirt with a foreign poricy of neutrality and prepare for a run on the ground.”“I was amazed that she took it,” Brodkin says. “She smiled as she did so. So thank you, Theresa, for that. I did it in a very non-threatening way. I never want to scare people, or cause alarm.“I’d dressed as a little Tory boy. Blue tie, blue cufflinks, side parting. So when I handed it to her, I looked like an aide trying to hand her something for her speech or something.“After she’d taken it, her security team were so unalarmed they just lowered me back down, as if they were going to sit me back in my seat.“So I went up to Boris and did my best Tory boy voice:\u0026nbsp‘That’s it Boris, I’ve given her it from you. Went well don’t you think?’ I gave him a slap on the thigh.“That was the point at which they appeared to work out, that guy should definitely not be there. The snappers were following me. Alarm bells were ringing with security. That’s when they realised, ‘Get this person out.’“That’s when the atmosphere did change, a visceral change, a wave of negativity towards me. The chants of ‘Scum! Scum!’ and then being dragged out did confirm that they didn’t want me there.”Created with Sketch.Tory conference 2017 – in pictures  Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

European Union flag during a protest on the opening day of the Conservative Party Conference, in ManchesterAs Brodkin was dragged out by security, a second wave of personnel rushed in. Huge sections of the press seats vacated in an instant and stampeded towards him, still not very much wiser about what exactly was going on. In the adjacent press room, scores of journalists jumped up and rushed towards the auditorium, seeking to cut him off at the exit.“I was sitting on the end seat and I could see he was going to be led out past me,” says the ’s chief political correspondent, Christopher Hope. It was he who, in the footage that went slightly viral later, was so penned in to the melee that his dictaphone appeared to be pressed like a Taser against Brodkin’s neck.\u0026nbsp“In more than 10 years in politics, my experience of these things is that when you have an intruder, or someone who eggs someone, or a protester, or someone who gets involved in a way that they shouldn’t, is that you’ve got about a minute before they’re led away.“I put my arm around him and just started yelling questions at him. Who are you? Are you an activist? What did you give to the prime minister? We didn’t know he was a prankster. You only have a minute to ask everything you can.”“Usually, after a stunt, there’s sort of an eerie\u0026nbspcalm. The security services remove you and it’s kind of quiet.“That is not what happened here. I was followed by this baying swarm of political journalists, trying to work out what was going on.“They were thinking, ‘Who is this guy? He is shouting all sorts of things.’ I don’t think any of them were thinking ‘comedy’.”“They were asking me these amazingly serious political questions. ‘Why have you done this? What have you done?’ And I said, ‘I’ve given Theresa May a P45!’ And they shouted, ‘Why?’ And I said, ‘Because Boris told me to!’“And this was the best bit. One journalist said, ‘When did he ask you? When did the meeting take place?’ That was one of my all time favourite moments. They were all having to walk backwards. They were hitting bins, they were hitting lampposts and shouting, ‘When did he tell you! When did he ask you to give it to her?’ I was just leaving a trail of fallen cameramen and journalists.”It was at that point, however, that things got a bit more tense, albeit briefly.“I was taken out of the melee and into the security zone and there was utter silence, and shit got serious. Six very large armed officers formed a ring around me. They don’t know what’s happened, they just know I’ve been dragged out by security having done something wrong. I’m stood there with these burly guys. In real life, I am a tiny Jew.Johnson unveils ‘better Brexit’ plan as he tells May to scrap ChequersEverything you need to know about the Conservative Party ConferenceMay told to end austerity by senior Conservative on eve of conferenceIf May offered a final say on Brexit, she would win another election“And they’re surrounding me with these guns and they’re all being very serious, right until one of the coppers looked to me and said, ‘Big fan of your stuff mate. But I think you might have pushed too far this time.’ That’s when I was thinking I’m in serious doodoo.“Then this detective came along, this smart looking woman. You know when they’re not wearing uniform they’re pretty high up the chain of command. She immediately thinks she’s got me bang to rights.“She flashed her badge to me and said, ‘Right. How the hell did you get in?’“I said, ‘I applied.’ She said, ‘What do you mean, you applied?’\u0026nbsp“Then you could see her thoughts, you know, what is she going to be able to do me for, just slowly ebbing away.“She said, ‘Okay, let’s just arrest him shall we\u0026nbspwhack him in the back of the van.’”Back in the conference hall, unbeknownst to Brodkin or to the phalanx\u0026nbspof media that had rushed after him, things had turned from bad to very much worse. Barely halfway through the speech, with whole pages still to go, Ms May had lost her voice entirely, and it was anything but clear how on earth she would make it to the end. By the point at which she did, the set was falling apart around her.“It was a very difficult day,” one of Ms\u0026nbspMay’s aides said. “I remember the huge outpouring of support for her in the hall. And there was that rather nice picture of Amber Rudd\u0026nbspgetting to her feet and willing her on. But if was a rather tough day.”\u0026nbspAs things were getting worse for the PM, things were getting better for Brodkin.“It was all over fairly quickly. At the end of the process they just said, ‘Sir, you are free to go.’“One of them said, ‘By the way, that was very funny.’ I got a couple of photos with them.“I guess it was Manchester, it was Theresa May, it was the police, who suffered huge cuts under her.”\u0026nbspBrodkin didn’t see the rest of the speech, and still hasn’t watched it. “They don’t give you live TV in the cells,” he says, which is not unreasonable. “But I heard reports she was struggling. I did feel sympathy for her.”Ms May has another speech to give this Wednesday, and Brodkin, who has worked for years as a standup,\u0026nbspsays he would be happy to meet up.“All of being a politician is about performance. If she wants to meet up we can try and work on delivery.”But he does offer one, more radical suggestion: “She still hasn’t used that P45, has she?”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Michael O’Neill and Northern Ireland continue to surpass all expectations. Alex McLeish is building an exciting young Scottish side. Wales are going from strength-to-strength under my old mate Giggsy.“And who can forget Gareth Southgate and England’s unbelievable performance this summer in Russia.“I made my Premier League debut in 1996, the last time there was a major football tournament on these shores, and the excitement across the country was something else. So I really welcome the support the government is offering.”Labour also backed the move. Tom Watson, the party’s deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, said: “Back in July I announced that a future Labour government would lend its full backing to a bid for the World Cup in 2030.“I’m delighted that the prime minister has followed Labour’s lead and is willing to back a bid.“This summer’s World Cup and the performance of England inspired the nation. In 2030, it’s time for football to come home.”Tories take aim at May ahead of party conference: ‘Stuck in the past’Johnson unveils ‘better Brexit’ plan as he tells May to scrap ChequersMay told to end austerity by senior Conservative on eve of conferenceMs May’s backing came as Damian Hinds, the education secretary, and Tracey Crouch, the sports minister, announced a new initiative to boost competitive sport in schools.The government will work alongside top sports organisations including the Premier League and the FA in a bid to get more children playing sport.\u0026nbspIt follows warnings that competitive sport among younger children has declined in recent years.Mr Hinds said: “Whilst we have done a lot to support schools to deliver sport – including the introduction and then doubling of the PE and Sports Premium – we need to go further to make sure that every child, whatever their background, has the opportunity to explore different kinds of sport and take part in competition in the one – or the many – that they enjoy.“Competitive sport also plays an important part in growing up. Learning to win humbly and pick yourself up again after a loss are useful life lessons. By coming together and striving for a goal, children learn key skills like teamwork and resilience.“These are character traits that will serve them well in later life, with businesses often talking to me about the ‘soft skills’ they look for in employees.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Therefore, we intend to vote against Unilever’s proposed resolution.”Investors should not despair – Unilever can still stay in the FTSE 100Unilever hikes idend and announces €6bn share buy-backLondon may be losing Unilever’s HQ but it must not lose its sharesUnilever, which has been based in Britain for almost a century, reviewed its dual-headed corporate structure in the aftermath of an attempted $143bn takeover from Kraft Heinz last year, as Dutch laws offer more comprehensive protections against hostile takeovers. Bosses have since tried to convince investors that their proposed Dutch incorporation will “create a simpler, more agile and more focused company”.Unilever needs at least 75 per cent of votes of London-listed shareholders in order to get the green light for an exodus from the capital.Mr Sadan added: “As a supportive shareholder in Unilever for more than 25 years, we have engaged with the company on a number of issues including its decision to unify its corporate structure. \u0026nbspWe asked the company to ensure that any approach they take safeguards the ability of our clients to maintain their investment and benefit from Unilever’s continued success.”LGIM’s decision to vote against the relocation plans of the UK’s third largest company mirrors the opposition expressed by other shareholders, including Brewin Dolphin, Lindsell Train and Columbia Threadneedle.Nicla Di Palma, equity analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said: “We aren’t convinced that the move will realise tangible benefits for shareholders and plan to vote against.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

All of this we shall be accepting \u0026ldquofor an unlimited period, with no provision for withdrawal.In a clumsy attempt to diminish the massive changes to the way Britain is governed the writer says: \u0026ldquoOverall it is clear that membership of the Community in its present form would involve only limited diminution of external sovereignty in practice.But just a page later the author makes it crystal clear that it is just a matter of time before Europe starts eating away at Britain\u0026rsquos ability to govern itself saying: \u0026ldquoThe loss of external sovereignty will however increase as the Community develops, according to the intention of the preamble to the Treaty of Rome \u0027to establish the foundations of an even closer union among the European peoples\u0027.Paragraph 12(I) is one of the most damning \u0026ndash as it clearly details the way in which EU law will trample over British law. But that this must be kept from the common knowledge of the British people.\u0026nbspHe writes: \u0026ldquoBy accepting the Community Treaties we shall have to adapt the whole range of subsidiary law which has been made by the Communities. Not only this but we shall be making provision in advance for the unquestioned direct application (i.e. without any further participation by Parliament) of Community laws not yet made (even though Ministers would have a part, through membership of the Council, in the making of some of these laws). Community law operates only in the fields covered by the Treaties, viz, customs duties agriculture free movement of labour services and capital transport monopolies and restrictive practices state aid for industry and the regulation of the coal and steel and nuclear energy industries. Outside this considerable range there would remain unchanged by far the greater part of our domestic law.Emmanuel Macron spoke to Jean-Claude Juncker at the European Social Summit in Gothenburg, Sweden (Image: )\u0026ldquoCommunity law is required to take precedence over domestic law: i.e. if a Community law conflicts with a statute, it is the statute which has to give way. This is something not implied in other commitments which we have entered into in the past. Previous treaties have imposed on us obligations which have required us to legislate in order to fulfil the international obligations set out in the treaty, but any discrepancy between our legislation and the treaty obligations has been solely a question of a possible breach of those international obligations the conflicting statute has still undoubtedly been the law to be applied in this country. But the community system requires that such Community Law as applies directly as law in this country should by virtue of its own legal force as law in this country prevail over conflicting national legislation.Clause III adds with shocking prescience that the seismic legal shift would in effect be creating a federal law in a United States of Europe. And this was 46 years ago, back in 1971.He writes: \u0026ldquoThe power of the European Court to consider the extent to which a UK statute is compatible with Community Law will indirectly involve an innovation for us, as the European Court\u0026rsquos decisions will be binding on our courts which might then have to rule on the validity or applicability of the United Kingdom statute.(iv) The Law Officers have emphasised that in accepting Community Law in this country we shall need to make it effective as part of a new and separate legal order, distinct from, but co-existing side by side with, the law of the United Kingdom. They have referred to the basic European Communities Treaty provisions as amounting \u0026ldquoin effect to a new body of \u0026lsquoFederal\u0026rsquo statute law.Next he deals with the reality of the homogenising of British life into European life and says:\u0026ldquoIn lay terms we may say that if Britain joined the Community there would be many implications for both external and internal (particularly parliamentary) sovereignty. Some of these would be wholly novel, and the general effect particularly in the longer turn would be of more pervasive and wide-ranging change than with any earlier commitments. Largely this is because the Community treaties when drawn up were seen as arrangements not merely for collaboration but for positive integration of large parts of the economic and social life of the Member States. As a result the conventional theoretical line iding internal from external affairs has become blurred, a process which as we have seen is already advancing with the development of transnational economic activity.Theresa May met with Donald Tusk at the European Council meetings (Image: )The patronising tone deepens further as the writer suggests Britain is populated by xenophobes who have a large \u0026lsquomistrust of foreigners.\u0026rsquo He bizarrely quotes novelist Nancy Mitford saying: \u0026ldquoNancy Mitford\u0026rsquos Uncle Matthew was not alone in considering that: \u0026ldquoAbroad is hell and foreigners are fiends.He writes:15.(i) National Identity:\u0026nbspWe are all deeply conscious through tradition, upbringing and education of the distinctive fact of being British. Given our island position and long territorial and national integrity, the traditional relative freedom from comprehensive foreign, especially European, alliances and entanglements, this national consciousness may well be stronger than that of most nations.When \u0026ldquosovereignty is called into question in the debate about entry to the Community, people may feel that it is this \u0026ldquoBritishness that is at stake. Hence Mr Rippon\u0026rsquos pointed question \u0026ldquoare the French any less French? for their membership. There is another, less attractive, aspect of this national pride. This is the large measure of dislike and mistrust of foreigners that persists in Britain. Nancy Mitford\u0026rsquos Uncle Matthew was not alone in considering that: \u0026ldquoAbroad is hell and foreigners are fiends.The EU is expected to say that they will start internal preparatory work on a post-Brexit transition period and a future trade deal with Britain                    Getty Images1 of 44Emmanuel Macron holds a press conference on the second day of European Council meetings(iii) Remoteness of the Bureaucracy: It is generally acknowledged that in modern industrialised society the impersonal and remote workings of the Government bureaucracy are sources of major anxiety and mistrust. The operations of democracy seem decreasingly fitted to control the all-embracing regulatory activities of the Civil Service. In entry to the Community we may seem to be opting for a system in which bureaucracy will be more remote (as well as largely foreign) and will operate in ways many of which are already determined and which are deeply strange to us. This bureaucracy is by common consent more powerful than compared with the democratic systems of the Community than is ideal. Yet the way to remedy this balance without reducing the Community to a mere standing association for negotiation between national Ministers is by strengthening the Community\u0026rsquos democratic processes which in turn means more change and more \u0026ldquoloss of sovereignty.The following paragraph iv is so damningly anti-British it reads like the ramblings of some pseudo Guy Burgess type Oxbridge communist attacking, as it does, Britain\u0026rsquos idea she has any power on the world stage as fantasy.He writes:(iv) National Power: As explained in paragraph 6 above, questions of power and influence have a close popular connection with ideas of sovereignty. The British have long been accustomed to the belief that we play a major part in ordering the affairs of the world and that in ordering our own affairs we are beholden to none. Much of this is mere illusion. As a middle power we can proceed only by treaty, alliance and compromise. So we are dependent on others both for the effective defence of the United Kingdom and also for the commercial and international financial conditions which govern our own economy. But this fact though intellectually conceded, is not widely or deeply understood instinctive attitudes derive from a period of greater British power. Joining the Community does strike at these attitudes: it is a further large step away from what is thought to be unfettered national freedom and a public acknowledgement of our reduced national power moreover, joining the Community institutionalises in a single, permanent coalition the necessary process of accommodation and alliance over large areas of policy, domestic as well as external. Even though these areas may be less immediately relevant to survival than defence, as covered by NATO, the form of the Community structure and the intentions explicit in the preamble to the Treaty of Rome emphasise the merging of national interests.In a section that could have been written 46 minutes ago rather than 46 years ago he deals with the inevitable \u0026ndash and welcome \u0026ndash single currency, and the prospect of an EU army.Theresa May arrived at the European Council meetings where she met with other European leaders (Image: )He writes: \u0026ldquo\u0026hellipbut it will be in the British interest after accession to encourage the development of the Community toward an effectively harmonised economic, fiscal and monetary system and a fairly closely coordinated and consistent foreign and defence policy. This sort of grouping would bring major politicoeconomic advantages but would take many years to develop and to win political acceptance. If it came to do so then essential aspects of sovereignty both internal and external would indeed increasingly be transferred to the Community itself.Towards the end the anti-British, pro-Europe rhetoric is in full flow, accepting Britain\u0026rsquos notion of itself as an independent state would be completely dismantled. Britain would be a European state, it\u0026rsquos Parliament neutered.19...then over a wide range of subjects (trade, aid, monetary affairs and most technological questions) Community policies toward the outside world would be common or closely harmonised. Although diplomatic representation would remain country by country its national role would be much diminished since the instructions to representatives would have been coordinated among member states. By the end of the century with effective defence and political harmonisation the erosion of the international role of the member states could be almost complete. This is a far distant prospect but as members of the Community our major interests may lie in its progressive development since it is only when the Western Europe of which we shall be a part can realise its full potential as a political as well as economic unit that we shall derive full benefits from membership.20. \u0026hellipof the functions of the Community could probably only take place with concomitant development of the institutions of the Community. It is hard to envisage the necessary decisions being taken under the present organisation of the Community more effective decision-making at Community level would either require majority voting on an increasing range of issues in the Council or stronger pressures to reach quick decisions by consensus. In either case the role of the Commission would become more important as the Community became responsible for the regulation of wider areas of the internal affairs of the member states and this would in turn increase the need to strengthen the democratic institutions of the Community, including perhaps a directly elected Parliament. In that event the development of a prestigious and effective directly elected Community Parliament would clearly mean the consequential weakening of the British Parliament as well as the erosion of \u0027parliamentary sovereignty\u0027.FCO 301048 even predicts Michel Barnier\u0026rsquos current attempt to bully and punish Britain for having the temerity to leave the EU saying member states would probably nominally have the ability to leave until about the year 2000, but such a move would have increasingly damaging economic consequences for the defector.And in yet another sideswipe at the British public he says it will be important for politicians to deal with \u0026ndash or cover-up \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoanxieties about British power and influence (masquerading under the term sovereignty) by presenting the choice between the effect of entry and on Britain\u0026rsquos power and influence in a rapidly changing world.Euroscepticism is rising across the continent                    AFPGetty Images1 of 7Austria: The hard-Right Freedom Party (FPO) has previously been accused of xenophobia and racism And the pressing need to cover-up the realities goes on in the next paragraph where he writes:\u0026ldquoAfter entry there would be a major responsibility on HMG and on all political parties not to exacerbate public concern by attributing unpopular measures or unfavourable economic developments to the remote and unmanageable workings of the Community. This counsel of perfection may be the more difficult to achieve because these same unpopular measures may sometimes be made more acceptable if they are put in a Community context, and this technique may offer a way to avoid the more sterile forms of inter-governmental bargaining.

The problem with a second referendum is that it will just reopen, I think, all the isions that emerged in 2016.\u0026ldquoWhat I want to see is a reasonable deal that allows us to get on with things, but also concentrate on some of those massive issues that people had around the country where they voted Leave.\u0026ldquoCommunities like Doncaster and\u0026nbspelsewhere\u0026nbspdidn\u0026rsquot feel they were getting a better share of the national wealth that they were entitled to.

He said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think there will be a second referendum, nor should there be.Ronnie Campbell, Labour MP for Blyth Valley, added that the Labour Party needed to be \u0026ldquovery careful about\u0026nbspa second\u0026nbspvote on Europe.He said: \u0026ldquoIf they are saying it is a vote for a no deal, that might be a different matter, because a no deal, we don\u0026rsquot know what a no deal could look like, we could go off an oblivion.\u0026ldquoBut, not on Europe. We have had that referendum. We are leaving Europe. We have got to leave on the best terms possible. And if the Tories can\u0026rsquot do it, there is a Labour Government there waiting to be in.Kent Labour Councillor Brendan Chilton claimed that Leave would win any future Brexit vote by a bigger majority but warned the party about \u0026ldquoalienating working-class voters from the Labour Party.Prominent Labour politicians have joined calls for a People\u0026rsquos Vote after Brexit negotiations, including the London Mayor Sadiq Khan.Addressing the conference on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn insisted Labour would not overturn Brexit but questioned the conduct of the May Government during the negotiations with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoLabour respects the decision of the British people in the referendum but no one can respect the conduct of the government since that vote took place.As it stands, Labour will vote against the Chequers plan or whatever is left of it and oppose leaving the EU with no deal. And it is inconceivable that we should crash out of Europe with no deal \u0026ndash that would be a national disaster.\u0026ldquoThat is why if Parliament votes down a Tory deal or the government fails to reach any deal at all we would press for a general election.

that little Amy is clever because she knows all the answers.What he doesn’t realise is that Amy does her homework with her family every night.American comedian Rob Delaney ignited a lively debate when he tweeted: “Why do they give seven-year-olds so much homework in the UK and how do I stop this?I want my kid frolicking and drawing and playing football.”Fellow celebrities Gary Lineker and Jason Manford agreed.Piers Morgan disagreed, calling the arguments “lazy parenting”.I have to disagree too with Mr Delaney and his supporters.Homework is essential for a child’s education because revisiting the day’s learning is what helps to make it stick.So Catastrophe star Rob and Gary Lineker are wrong in attacking compulsory home-work in primary schools.Sure, you’ll get the odd exceptionally bright pupil who will excel just through what she learns at school, despite not having that support at home.But this is very rare.Teaching is not just the teacher’s job.It takes a village to raise a child.Children learn all the time and the environment surrounding them determines how much they learn.Genes play a part in how clever a child is, but how hard they work also matters.Work hard and you’ll learn lots.Work less and you’ll learn less.Don’t make the mistake of thinking homework is for a child to do on their own.When parents use homework to bond and learn together with their child, the child understands that Mum and Dad value learning.And because a child wants to please their parents, the child’s interest in their home-work will grow, year on year.These children can see the benefit of homework and will enjoy doing it because it makes them feel better about themselves.Everyone loves to feel successful.Ten years ago, author Malcolm Gladwell introduced the idea that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in something.We get better at what we practise, whether it’s football or maths.Our brains have a working memory and a long-term memory.If your times tables are stored in your long-term memory, you will quickly be able to calculate what it will cost to buy 12 apples instead of two.If that knowledge isn’t there, you’ll have to resort to counting on your fingers.The more knowledge stored in long-term memory, the better equipped you’ll be to think imaginatively and solve complex problems.Homework revisits what you learn at school to cement it into your long-term memory.I do agree that some home-work is pointless.Silly craft projects that involve gluing things together, which the parent will inevitably end up doing, hold no value for me.I also understand why some parents don’t like homework — they feel that it’s a battle.Parenting is hard.I get that.But we need to stop thinking of homework as a chore that the child is sent off to do, cutting into the parent’s precious time with them.It shouldn’t be the case on Sunday night that Mum says: “Oh God, it’s homework time — let’s get it over with.”Instead, learning should be part of daily le, and an enriching time for both the parent and the child.Reading with your child for 20 minutes should not be a chore.Asking them to count peas on their plate should not be hard work.While you’re out in the street, talk to them about the world around them.This is the sort of homework that is often set for very young children and it can be done without making it feel like a formal lesson.It doesn’t need to be half an hour sitting at a desk.It can just be ten minutes of enjoyable time together.Homework can be written down but can also be spoken or done online, leaving little marking for the teacher.Secondary-school homework can help you learn with your child.You can learn some French again or be reminded of the beauty of Shakespeare!How wonderful is that?By scaffolding the support at home, you can gradually wean them off it, just like taking off bike stabilisers.Eventually, they learn to work independently, so that when they get to GCSEs, they will be in the habit of doing their homework each night.If you don’t get them into the homework habit from an early age, you risk having a battle with a stroppy teen as they approach their exams.And no parent wants that.Those who are against homework will argue that their children have no time for other hobbies.This is nonsense.Children generally finish school at 3.15pm, and younger ones tend to go to bed at about 8pm.That’s nearly five hours of free time.Are they really spending it playing hockey or going to Brownies?I doubt it.Half an hour of homework in five hours of spare time is a drop in the ocean, leaving lots of time for other things.The real worry for parents should be how much time children are spending on social media — something that is so very dangerous and takes up hours of their time, unlike homework.Katharine Birbalsingh is head of Michaela Community School, North London, and has been dubbed the country’s “strictest head teacher”.She introduced an ultra-disciplined approach to

Thick as he is, ­Corbyn sees no contradiction.Then it was on to Jezza curing all our ills with freebies galore and mass job creation, all presumably funded by the same tax on the rich. Since Labour aides now privately admit their 2017 manesto secretly covered up a £1TRILLION bill, Corbyn’s assurances aren’t worth the autocue they are written on.This smug, cocky Labour conference is an annual reminder of just what a dishonest rabble they now are. Sickeningly posing as defenders of the dispossessed while plotting to annul their Brexit votes with a second referendum, brought about by orchestrating chaos.One moronic MP even demanded a General Strike to oust the Government.

Where investors would fear to tread and from which anyone who could would flee.Labour’s candidate for PM is a dim, vain, vindictive, unapologetically anti­-Semitic ball of rage who loathes scrutiny, lies habitually about his true beliefs and past terrorist connections and is, his aides admit, “not good in the mornings”.But the Tories must not mistake all that for a free pass. Corbyn’s plans have traction only because the Government has left the battlefield.Theresa May and Philip Hammond are timid tinkerers when we need radical steps to put more money in pockets and make homes affordable.

But in 1920, Elsies mum, Polly Wright, took the pictures to a mythical research group called the Theosophical Society to be investigated.Leading society member Edward Gardner was instantly taken with the photos. He blew them up into prints and started selling them at his talks.Then, in 1920, keen spiritualist and Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle came across the photos while he was researching a magazine article about the creatures.He believed they were real and when he published them, he created a national controversy which left some of the most esteemed scientists and thinkers of the time earnestly arguing whether fairies really do exist.Fairy buff Edward Gardner was also convinced. He went to visit the Wright family and set the girls up with a camera so they could capture more evidence.In the summer of 1920, they took three more images of themselves with the fairies, fuelling more interest in the bizarre debate.Doyle also contacted photo company Kodak, asking expert technicians to examine the prints for signs that they had been tampered with.The response was that the photos showed no signs of being faked, although Kodak refused to provide a certicate of authenticity. Doyle maintained that they were real.Newspapers soon picked up on his claims, with some writers agreeing that the photos seemed legitimate, while others poured scorn on the supernatural shots.Some sceptics noted that the fairies looked too traditional to be real, as  they had been plucked out of a nursery rhyme, while other criticisms included the claim that the fairies hairstyles were suspiciously fashionable.Knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that they have pulled one of them, one critic wrote.With nobody able to agree, the story eventually died down, only to be reignited decades later with a spectacular twist.In 1966, a reporter tracked down Elsie, who admitted that the fairies might have been figments of my imagination.Frances was also tracked down and quizzed about the photos. A rational person doesnt see fairies, she admitted, but she claimed the photos were genuine nonetheless.However, the cousins eventually confessed that the pictures were a hoax, and that they had made the fairies themselves, before throwing their props into a river to hide the truth.Elise and Frances, by that time old women, conceded in 1983 that they had drawn the mythical beings onto cardboard, cut them out and then arranged them in the garden with hatpins to make them stand up.Bizarrely though, Frances then claimed that one of the five photos - showing a cluster of fairies wading around long grass - was never faked, even though the others were.She also claimed at one point that she really had seen the fairies in real-le, but then staged the photos so she had evidence.Later, in 1985, Elsie revealed why she had gone along with the prank for so long, saying she had been embarrassed about fooling Conan Doyle and didnt want to show him up.Two village kids and a brilliant man like Conan Doyle – well, we could only keep quiet, she said.Frances added: I never even thought of it as being a fraud – it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I cant understand to this day why they were taken in.A year later, Frances died, and Elsie followed in 1988. However, their hoax remains commonly thought of as one of the greatest ruses of the 20th century, and the legacy of their photos lives on today.Expected to sell for at least £2,000, the first two Cottingley Fairy photos are being auctioned off in Gloucester on October 4, when a new owner can get their hands on a piece of history - and a little bit of real-le magic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s more than double what we’d normally receive,\u0026#8221 he says.\u0026#8220It’s not just maggots in bins, they’re dropping from the ceiling in homes and shops.”And Peter says we are ALL responsible for the maggot population explosion.“Britain’s hot summer has meant there was a healthy fly count. We’ve all been outside in the garden or parks for picnics,\u0026#8221 he tells Sun Online.“When food gets left in the heat it rots quicker as bacteria forms much faster in warm temperatures. It’s a feasting ground for flies.“It means that maggots are hatching in gardens, bins and also on dead animals around suburban homes and gardens.”According to Peter, home and business owners are only now discovering they are living with maggots thanks to the recent drop in temperatures.“Rats and mice aren’t stupid. If a building isn’t rodent proof they know how to get in out the cold.\u0026#8220The problem is, when well-meaning homeowners put down DIY poisoning they\u0026#8217ll die in the walls – but flies lay their eggs on those rotting corpses.“This week we’ve been called out to an opticians with maggots falling from the ceiling in the client waiting area. That was as the result of a dead animal in the vents.“A restaurant also had to temporarily shut up shop because maggots were dropping down into their customers\u0026#8217 food. It is distressing for everyone involved.”Maggots can be killed with boiling water – but pest control experts advise to always look for the reason behind why the maggots hatched in the first place.Peter’s advice is simple: “As disgusting as they are there is always an even more sinister reason you’ve got them. Identy that and you’re sorted.“It could be a dead pigeon in the roof or a poisoned rotting mouse under the floorboards. \u0026#8220Flies love bacteria-spewing corpses and will lay dozens of eggs on them.“If they are in your bins – you need to make sure clean them out regularly, with a disinfectant.

All areas must be maintained in a clean condition.”Inspectors swooped on the premises after receiving a complaint about a lack of hot water on the premises.The unnamed inspector said: “There was no supply of hot water to the sinks and wash hand basins at the premises due to a fault with the boiler.“A supply of constant running hot and cold water must be provided in order to allow for effective cleaning of the premises and hand washing to be carried out.”Inspectors also highlighted the branch’s poor stock rotation after a container of porridge oats was found to have an expired best before date.After it was inspected the branch was given a zero hygiene rating.The branch was then voluntarily down.According to the paper, the chain has vowed to seek a re-inspection once all the issues in the report have been rectied.A spokeswoman for Subway told The Sun: We have clear expectations and procedures in place to ensure that stores serve products that meet our food safety standards.Immediate action was taken regarding the issues highlighted and were rectied two months ago.The Environmental Health Officer has confirmed that all works have been carried out to their satisfaction and will re-visit the store once three months have passed, and we look forward to their next inspection.All staff have received hygiene and food safety re-training in Food Safety Levels 1 and 2.The Sun has contacted Hull Council for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004354935072.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"angela merkel wants to stop britain thriving after brexit david davis blasts","story":"The former Brexit Secretary said only French president Emmanuel Macron is taking a harder line against the UK than the German Chancellor, accusing them of being ‘emphatic about us not being seen to succeed’.Speaking to the Evening Standard on the eve of Tory conference, Mr Davis predicted the negotiations will “go the distance”, with any trade deal being clinched only at the last minute.The ex-Cabinet minister also branded the Salzburg summit, where the Prime Minister’s Chequers pan was mauled by EU leaders, a “collective cock-up ... on both sides”.But he reserved his anger at the impasse in the talks on getting an agreement hammered out for Mr Macron.Mr Davis pointed the finger firmly at Paris for “playing hardball”, saying there are three “strong elements” driving its policy.He said one was the “daft argument” that it will only encourage others  the UK gets a good deal.The second: “Is a very, very narrow French one of trying, as it were, to raid our economy to get businesses to go to France.”And the third is the “hysterically wrong” French view of “what they think of us as deregulatory ‘Wild West’ Anglo-Saxon approach to economics”.The 69-year-old, who stood down in July over Mrs May’s draft proposals, also hit out at Ms Merkel.He said: “I don’t think Merkel was ever really going to be our champion, ever, ever … neither Macron, nor Merkel.”Elsewhere in the interview he said Mrs May has to show the Tory conference in Birmingham she is “tough enough to stand up” to Brussels.But he warned of more Brexit turmoil ahead, stressing it is “tough now but it will get tougher” as the countdown to the end of Article 50 approaches.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He proved that Becks’ notice of prosecution had arrived a day later than it should have. Mr Loophole – real name Nick Freeman – is the lawyer of choice for celebrities who want to get off a driving charge .Sir Alex Ferguson avoided being punished for driving on the hard shoulder of the motorway after Freeman argued in court that the former Manchester United manager was having a “squeaky bum time”, desperately driving to use the Old Trafford toilet while suffering an upset stomach.No stranger to controversy, the lawyer caused a furore this year after suggesting that women who didnt want to be upskirted should “should dress more conservatively”.“The more provocative the attire,” he argued, “the greater risk of someone wanting to have a sneaky view.”Freeman clearly loves his job. He’s written before that loop-hole hunting has left him “almost shaking with excitement ”.If youre a Peeping Tom, or any other kind of law-breaker, in need of help, Freeman could probably mount an effective defence –  you can afford his astronomical fees.But helpfully, Freeman wrote a book, called, of course, The Art of The Loophole.It details his sneaky legal knowledge that has got the likes of Ronnie OSullivan, Sir Alex Ferguson, Freddy Flintoff and Charlotte Crosby off the hook.So  you cant afford thousands, here are some tips from his book that will help you beat the rap.As a rookie prosecutor, he lost a drunk-driving case because hed hadnt submitted a printout of the breathalyser record, only getting a police officer to say the reading in court. If you want to escape law, you should check  the prosecution has followed the law and submitted its evidence correctly. Any little cock-up by them could be your ticket to freedom.Having saved Fergie his licence by arguing for the poor state of the Scotsmans bowels , he thinks medical reasons can be a strong defence.If you couldnt blow into a breathalyser because you had a cold, “then it could be recorded on the station’s CCTV. And there may be ious officers who might remember whether or not you were sneezing or coughing.” But “you can’t simply make it up,” he counsels. “Otherwise you waste my time and your money”.“You might think that in our over-scrutinised, flash-happy age of the speed camera, proving the identity of the driver in a motoring case is fairly easy,” Freeman says. “Not so.” Having got footballer Ashley Ward off a speeding rap by arguing the prosecution couldnt prove the identity of the driver. “If a policeman doesn’t ask for some kind of concrete ID, such as a driving licence with a photo, he leaves himself wide open to being unable to confirm identity,” advises Mr Loophole, having seen the Crown lose many cases because lazy coppers didnt ask for official identication.He recalls another case: “Court papers referred to my client as exposing his penis. He claimed that it was his testes. Could the Crown be sure beyond reasonable doubt that they could ID his anatomy?”Don’t blab your story, even to your solicitor. “It’s not my job to prove he wasn’t disqualied,” he writes of a case, “it’s the Crown’s to prove he was”. So dont admit to any possible wrongdoings to a lawyer – and possibly compromising them – and just let them see  the Crown can make a case against, and there may be “a whole assortment of defects in the paperwork alone that might stop them from doing that.”When Lee Bowyer was convicted for speeding, allegedly peaking at 132mph in his Porsche, Freeman noticed slight dferences in the officers four reports. This weakened the case enough to help him to get the Crown to accept a plea of speeding at 99mph, giving Bowyer a ban of only six weeks and no penalty points. Similarly, Dwight Yorke was pulled over for allegedly driving at 102mph, but the officer made seven subsequent changes to his first report – making for a shaky case that resulted in only a fourteen-day ban.Freeman advises that we always check the small print: “wherever you get paperwork, human error isn’t lagging far behind.” The most common errors being “names are misspelt, or wrong addresses or dates are recorded, notices or,” as happened with Beckham this week, “summonses arrive after the allotted time for their dispatch has expired.” Each and any error is a possible escape route from conviction. “The trick then is to be able to spot such errors. There’s no real skill here – just a laser-like focus.”Freeman once got a client off the hook after hed refused to take a breathalyser test following crash that devastated a family. The police failed to charge him for his refusal, wanting to get him to take a blood test – the results of which were inadmissible because the rules hadnt been obeyed. “If the police had followed the correct protocol my client would have been convicted,” admits Freeman. “It was because of this error – this loophole – that he walked free.”A brilliantly successful lawyer, Freeman focuses on making sure the Crown has done its job properly.If it hasnt then whether you did or didnt commit a crime doesnt matter. No case is too big to fail  they havent made it properly, and can be beaten just by looking for the largely minor mistakes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s a bit cramped, a bit tight, but it’s fine.”Today Anandamohanadas told The Sun he had no idea his property had been raided.He said: “This is the first I’ve heard of this. I was there at 10am yesterday.”In stark contrast to the property he rents to tenants making £1,000 a week, his immaculate home lies in a quiet cul-de-sac in Letchworth, Hertfordshire.A white Toyota Rav 4 in the driveway and the house has large extension with a private garden.Outside the rented property occupied by Romanian builders a tenant said: “I sublet from another tenant. I’ve been in the UK since 2010 so I’m kind of a British citizen.”Furious neighbours Karson Mepani, 64 and his we Manbai, 62, have complained to the council about the slum housing and claim food and cigarette butts are thrown into their garden.They also claim their Romanian neighbours play loud music from 10pm at night and are regularly heard fighting and shouting between each other in the house.Karson Mepani said: “It has been let out for the past two or three years.“But the landlord does not know about what the letting agent is doing.“They play loud Romanian music from 10pm until the early hours especially on Saturdays, the noise is dreadful.“We also regularly hear them fighting inside, shouting and screaming at each other.“We are p****d off, I would not mind 50 people living next door  they weren’t so noisy.“Several times we have had food and cigarette ends thrown into our garden.“They are also hanging clothes out to dry on the fence between our houses.“They are disruptive neighbours and we are delighted that someone is finally doing something about it.”A spokeswoman for Brent Council said it was one of the worst illegal HMOs it has uncovered.She said: Aside from seeing rodents or cockroaches it is one of the worst we have seen.The loft was just appalling -

Ladbrokes is offering odds of 4/6 that a new leader will be in place within a year.So several of the top candidates to replace her are now competing to boost their popularity with activists and their fame among the public.Well-known Tories are planning to speak at multiple fringe meetings, setting out their vision for Britain and their election pitch.Here we profile the top candidates who are clamouring for position over the four-day conference.Boris Johnson is the bookies favourite to take over from Theresa May - with odds of 10/1 that hell be the leader a year from now.At the party conference hes keeping his powder relatively dry, doing just one fringe event.But that meeting - in a hall with a capacity of 1,000 - is set to be one of the standout moments of the conference.Boris will be keen to prove hes still a superstar among the Tory faithful who have the last say on who will succeed Mrs May.Michael Gove, who as Environment Secretary is hailed as one of the most dynamic Cabinet ministers, is listed to speak at least five times.He is attempting to burnish his green credentials by appearing at events hosted by farming and environment groups.Mr Gove hopes that developing a pro-environment image will help him with swing voters around the country.Sajid Javid is seen as the frontrunner for the leadership among ministers who voted Remain in the EU referendum.As well as making a speech from the conferences main stage, hes expected to appear at a number of carefully picked fringe events.He will address one meeting debating the importance of law and order - his current brief as Home Secretary.And crucially, Mr Javid is helping to host a reception for MPs elected since 2015 - who could hold the key to the next leadership election because theyre seen as being less committed to a particular candidate already.Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is fast developing a reputation as the Cabinets resident Tigger because of her upbeat demeanour and raft of policy ideas.Shes now regarded as a dark horse for the leadership, with her quirky Instagram account gaining her fans from among young activists.Ms Truss is speaking at several fringe events - mostly aimed at promoting free-market ideas and appealing to the youth.Priti Patel was forced to quit the Cabinet last year after meeting Israeli politicians in secret.But she still harbours leadership ambitions and hopes to overtake Boris and Mr Gove among Brexiteers.So she is appearing at a number of high-profile fringes, including a pro-Brexit rally and a think-tank debate on the future of Conservatism.Amber Rudd is another ex-minister who still hasnt given up on the aim of making it to 10 Downing Street one day.As a former Home Secretary, she is an expert on immigration and security policy - two of the most important areas for the Tory grassroots.Ms Rudd is speaking on security in the internet age at one fringe, and attending two talks on migration.Jacob Rees-Mogg was the main attraction at last years conference, with every event he spoke at packed out with adoring activists.This year hes dialled it back a bit - but hes still scheduled to speak at seven dferent fringes.Observers will be keen to see whether he still has the same star power as he did a year ago."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437753181.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"school close early friday birmingham","story":"The head teacher said he would save the cash-strapped school £18,500 by shaving an hour and 20 minutes off every Friday.The school day will still finish at 3:20pm Monday to Thursday at St Peter and St Paul RC Junior and Infant School.On Friday all 210 students go to a whole-school assembly with the head teacher Neil Porter at 1pm and parents come at 2pm.Porter says teachers now have more time to plan their lessons.The Erdington school also saves money by not having to pay supply staff to supervise children.Mr Porter said: It was probably the most challenging thing Ive had to do as a head teacher, as lots of my parents work and we are not in an affluent area, so they were very concerned about the impact.However, parents have complained about how they have had to change their work schedules.Mum-of-three Juliette O’Donnell said she had to cut her hours at work and her husband now has to work weekends.She told the BBC: “That early finish has meant parents having to take a pay cut as we have done, or having to pay extra for additional childcare.”Grandmother Brenda Keeley said the cutbacks are awful.She added: “If it wasn’t for me picking up my granddaughter, my daughter would have to give up work all together.”Another disgruntled parent, Rob Stinton, says he now works longer hours Monday to Thursday so he is able to leave early on a Friday.He said: “It’s hard but we have to do what is best for the children’s education,  that’s what it takes.”The change also means the pupils lunch is five minutes less at lunch and they stay five minutes longer Monday to Thursday.Teachers spend the extra time on Fridays at school for planning, preparation and assessment, which they have to do.Porter says the total budget for the school is £970,000, which was cut from last year’s £983,000.These measures have made it possible to cut the budget deficit for the school from £26,000 to £4,000.This is not the first school in Birmingham to cut their school days.Anderton Park School in Sparkhill has shaved 45 minutes off their finishing time.Head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson said: “Early finishes are definitely more and more prevalent at schools now.“We are slowly sinking.”The government said Birmingham received £909million for the 2018-2019 school year, which is a £4million increase from 2017-2018.A Department for Education spokesperson said:“We know that we are asking schools to do more, which is why we are helping them to reduce the £10 billion spent each year on non-staffing costs, providing government-backed deals for things like printers and energy suppliers that are helping to save millions of pounds.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437656276-e1538159577933.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dad dodged child support decade caught 125k postcode lottery win tv","story":"Stella Davis, 44, was stunned to spot grinning Richard Bailey, 43, being handed the massive cheque.The barmaid and son Owen, 17, have not seen the lorry driver since 2008 and she claims he owes her £3,065.22.Stella had no idea where he was living until she saw him and new we Lisa, 44, being handed the cheque by former X Factor star Danyl Johnson last Sunday.Richard says in the ad: “Brilliant.

He was dead.The tragic cockapoo — a mix of the cocker spaniel and poodle — was just the latest casualty of a growing global demand for fashionable hybrid pets.The mostly criminal market to supply these designer dogs leaves a trail of horrendous abuse and suffering, with animal lovers often unaware of the high cost of cute.A look inside unlicensed puppy farms reveals dogs whose coats are stained yellow from lying in their own waste. Mothers in crammed cages suckle their puppies — both dead and alive.And those who are considered not cute enough to make the grade are suffocated, battered to death or left to die in a bin, riddled with maggots.For every “perfect” pup that finds a loving home, many more are systematically destroyed. So horrendous has this market become, even the man who created the first ever labradoodle wishes he had never done it.Wally Conron successfully mated a labrador with a poodle in late 1980s to create Sultan for the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia. He was motivated by a blind woman‘s desire for a guide dog that would not shed hair because her husband was allergic to it.But 30 years on Wally, now 90, says he regrets his experiment because it opened a “Pandora’s box”.Like drug trafficking, the designer dog world is predominantly run by organised criminals, whose only concern is making a profit.In 2012, the UK relaxed its border controls for travelling with pets. This opened the floodgates for trafficking in and out of the country.Dogs are mainly smuggled into the UK from Ireland, Ukraine and Hungry, flouting laws saying they must be at least 15 weeks old, microchipped, vaccinated against rabies, treated for tapeworm and have a pet passport.Organised gangs will also steal pedigree pets from their owners and take them to a breeding farm. Prices start at £500 and can rise to £3,000 depending on what you order.“Custom-made” and “allergy-free” dogs like Sultan can fetch even higher price tags.Along with the cockapoo, popular hybrid breeds include puggle , labradoodle , sprocker , Minnie Jack  and maltipoo .While dogs are the main focus of the designer pet industry, there are also kitten mills. The twisty cat or “squitten” is a cat bred specically for the deformity of stunted forelegs, so it looks like a cross between a cat and a squirrel.Fuelled by social media — Instagram is full of accounts for designer dogs — the appetite for hybrids seems never-ending. To feed this desire, organised criminals play God, creating Frankendogs — while destroying those who do not make the grade.Unlicensed and unregistered, they are free to treat the animals any way they like.Last year I was part of a team that raided a large puppy farm in Hawaiian Gardens, a city in Los Angeles County, which is where we discovered the dead cockapoo with the sign around its neck.We were alerted to the farm after receiving calls from people who bought puppies there that became seriously ill or died within days. The operation had no permits for boarding, breeding or selling.Our investigation revealed puppies who were about two weeks old, with designer breeds including miniature pinscher, Lhasa apso, dachshund, Maltese, poodle, Korean Jindo and English bulldog — all in ill health and kept in appalling conditions.In the breeding area, there were dogs with ulcerated eyes who were lethargic and unresponsive. Ears and tails cut off and tossed in bin. Wire cages were stacked and crammed with animals.The odours from the birthing secretions, dead puppies, filth, ammonia, faeces and mucus were awful. The puppies that were still alive were silent. We seized 367 dogs in total.The owners were banned from running any animal-related business and had to pay a fine of £65,000. Not long after, we raided another pet shop in Lynwood, also in Los Angeles County.We were met with another horric scene: Animals left to die in a bin behind the store, others covered in faeces, suffering from a catalogue of health problemsThere was a bloody newspaper over a table and syringes and sedatives in a bin. Some dogs’ ears and tails had been cut off and were crying in pain, their severed ears tossed into a bin.The investigation later revealed that when the store owner no longer wanted the animals — usually because they had medical issues or were no longer puppies — he suffocated them, beat them or threw them against the wall.The owner was convicted on multiple charges of animal cruelty and received six years in prison. These cases may have been in America but they are typical of the cruelty and neglect designer dogs can suffer all over the world in the push for profit.Animals like the ones found in these case frequently have ongoing medical problems for the rest of their lives. Sadly, the puppies were likely born ill, from overbred and malnourished mothers, and survived stressful transport to the pet shop only to be mistreated.They were born in squalor, transported in pain and then left in wretched conditions waiting to be bought. At only weeks old, they would have known no relief, no care and no peace.Our investigation has not been without its dficulties. While we have rescued tens of thousands of dogs from horric puppy farms and pet shops, we have received a backlash from some of the breeders.Sometimes they will break into our animal shelters and try to steal the seized dogs back. Other times they will throw rocks at our windows or send us threatening emails.

In negotiations you do that.“But we need credible responses for the proposals we have set out or credible alternatives, and we haven’t seen them yet.”Saturday marks the six-month countdown to Brexit on March 29. But Mr Raab — the 44-year-old former Foreign Office lawyer — made it clear there can be no extension to talks past the summit planned for November 18.He said any delay, even to December, would leave it “extremely dficult” for either side to pass it through parliament.The Brexit Secretary added: “Otherwise we will end up with, in some ways what might be the worst case, which is a deal but without the time to implement it.”Despite the ticking clock, he admitted Brussels is yet to respond to Mrs May’s demand for movement from the EU.He said: “The ball is in their court.You wouldn’t expect to unblock some of those bigger sticking points around Northern Ireland and the Economic Partnership by now.”Warning that Britain won’t be reduced to begging, he added: “We are not some minnow. We are one of the biggest EU economies, one of the biggest economies in the world.“We are not going to get on our hands and knees and crawl back cap in hand for this deal.We are going to extend the arm of friendship, and see  it is reciprocated.”And in a rallying call to unite a split Tory Party, he said: “When we have got a deal negotiated with the EU and the option of No Deal, I think it will focus minds and I am confident that colleagues will put some of those dferences behind them and we will unite around a common position.”BRUSSELS has threatened to slap tough border limits on Brits  Theresa May’s post-EU immigration plans go ahead.Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, pictured below, warned of a tit-for-tat battle in a letter ahead of the Tory party conference.The PM will unveil plans to end priority job access for EU nationals and focus on those with in-demand skills.Mr Verhofstadt said the bloc will not sign a deal discriminating on nationality or type of job.

But not anymore.It was unmistakably a big cat, it was enormous. It was around four feet long and it had a long curved tail which was around 18 inches long.There was no mistaking it for anything else, it was caught right in the beam of my torch and it was the eyes I saw first, they were bright green and around the size of an old penny.I was a bit apprehensive because it was quite a short distance away from me, only about 30 to 40 yards but from that distance I could tell it wasnt a dog or a domestic cat.I called out for Judith, my we, but she had gone back into the house so she didnt see it. He rigged up the camera near his home in Gatebeck, near Kendal, on September 11 and only had to wait two days before this photo was taken.Roy added: When I saw the picture it came as no shock to me because I knew what I had seen - I wasnt drunk and Ive no reason to make up a thing like that.What the image does achieve is to confirm its size. The water trough in the picture is six feet long so taking perspective into account the cat must be about 3ft 9in long. This is just the latest potential sighting in the local area.An estate agent friend of Roys reported seeing a big cat on his driveway as she was driving past on her way home.And during the cold snap earlier this year his son-in-law took a video showing giant paw prints the size of a mans gloved hand. Roy believes the cat lives in the vast expanse of wild countryside that borders the M6 through south Cumbria and feeds on rabbits.Since 2003 there have been reports of a large black cat in the same area with numerous sightings at Kendal, Sizergh, Sedbergh, Brigsteer and Witherslack.Last Stuart Wild and his we Liz were enjoying a stroll in the Lake District when they came across a similar creature near the hamlet of Little Langdale.Liz, 54, from Worcester, said at the time: There were some sheep in the field and one of my friends said: Look at that dog.But it was very feline and very, very big. You know how a cat stalks? It was like that. It was jet black and walking slowly. In March 2016 holidaying midwe Claire Greensmith spotted a “big, black panther-like creature” while hiking at a Colwith Force near Ambleside, In March 2015 a Freedom of Information request revealed that Cumbria Police had received 40 big cat sightings since 2003.Danny Bamping, from the British Big Cat Society, was doubtful that Roys photo was of a big cat.He said: The picture clearly shows a domestic cat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson will draw a big crowd for his “Chuck Chequers” rally.But there is a bigger danger waiting in the wings for the Tories: They simply don’t have a domestic agenda big enough for the moment.Labour has, over the past few days, set out its vision for Britain. It is, in places, scary. But give Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this, it is undoubtedly clear and bold. As one Cabinet minister says, half admiringly:  “They’re hungry.”The Tories need to show  they have a better plan, one that will deal with people’s concerns— and they don’t have any time to waste. As one minister warns: “I’m just really terried. People don’t realise what a big deal this is.”The Tory Party’s problem is that it isn’t giving the country a vision of where it wants to take it. One former party leader has taken to lamenting that the Tories have “lost the narrative”.At conference last year, Theresa May declared that it was her mission to solve the housing crisis, to restore the British dream of home ownership for the many.But in the past 12 months, the Government has made far too little progress on this. Yes, some sensible steps have been taken. But the policies that will really solve this crisis, proper planning reform and a massive, Government-led housebuilding programme, haven’t happened.The result of all this: Jeremy Corbyn gets closer to power. As this newspaper revealed yesterday, Labour is now ahead in the seats that decide general elections thanks to its massive lead among renters.The likelihood of someone in their late twenties or early thirties on an average salary owning their own home has halved in the past 20 years.This is an electoral time bomb for the Tories. They can’t expect those without capital, or any prospect of getting it, to be capitalists.By the time of the next election, the Tories need to show people that their lives are getting better AND explain the damage  Corbyn would do to the country.One minister points the finger of blame at Number 10 for the Tory predicament. “A fish rots from the head down,” he tells me. But the Cabinet can’t escape its share of the blame, either.With a few exceptions, min­isters aren’t doing enough to take on Labour’s arguments. As one former Secretary of State fumed to me during Labour conference: “It’s outrageous. Where are the Cabinet?”If the Tories get Brexit wrong, it could cost them the next election. But even  they get a decent deal, it won’t guarantee them victory. For the public will vote on domestic issues — whether the housing crisis is solved, the state of the health service and what is going on with schools.Corbyn has simple answers to all these questions: They might be wrong, but they are answers. The Tories now need to show the country  they have answers too.AT last, some positivity and optimism about this country’s post-Brexit future from the Government.I can reveal  it is planning a major new festival celebrating the UK for 2022. The aim is for this festival to tell the world a story about Britain as we leave the EU and take charge of our own future. It is meant to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Birmingham that year.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright,  who is pushing this idea in Whitehall, has told colleagues  it will be: “Future-facing, telling a story about the UK’s unique strengths, particularly as a place to invest, as we forge a new future outside the European Union.”If the Government gets it right, this festival could be a great statement about the open, dynamic country that Britain is going to be after Brexit. It should emphasise how this country is going out into the world after leaving the EU, not pulling up the drawbridge.The aim should be to put on something that stands comparison with the great post-war Festival of Britain in 1951 or even the Great Exhibition of 1851, which showcased Victorian Britain’s global reach and technological edge.One Secretary of State, who is backing the idea, tells me: “People just want something really positive.”But cynics might note that there is an advantage for the Tories in a feel-good festival in an election year.But I understand he will  have a harsh message for the Westminster politicians in attendance. He will  tell them to stop bickering and positioning and get on with delivering for the country.Mr Street will say that outside the Westminster bubble, the public just want politicians to get on with things, rather than constantly jostling for position.What makes his  speech so interesting is that he is a Downing Street favourite. Indeed, I understand  some of those close to Theresa May are pushing for a similar tone in her speech.They believe  her post-Salzburg speech went down so well with the public not just because she was standing up to the EU but because she was taking charge and being that “bloody dficult woman”. They think she should use her speech to tell members  they won’t get everything  they want from the Brexit talks, but that she will get the best deal for Britain.Others, though, are wary of this approach. One Cabinet minister cautions that after last year, May should play it safe as “you can’t have two bad years  in a row”.THE Government has rightly guaranteed that the three million EU citizens living in Britain will be able to stay in the event of no deal.This is sensible. These citizens contribute a lot to this country, and help keep our economy and our public services moving.But it is also right that the Government is now discussing what the rules will be for deporting EU citizens who commit crimes after Brexit in a no-deal scenario.The details have not yet been decided and, as one government source puts it: “No one wants people deported for getting a parking ticket.”But it is right that those who are convicted of a signicant offence are removed.• SPOT the leadership bid will be one of the games  the Tories play in Birmingham.Any Cabinet minister who starts talking about their childhood will be accused of planning a run for the top job.  This leaves ministers walking a tightrope as they prepare their speeches. Some are dealing with this challenge by handing their time  to others.Penny Mordaunt, the Aid Secretary, is simply introducing a series of “British heroes” who do development work.But one of those involved in conference planning suspects that even this is about leadership as Mordaunt “doesn’t want to spend 45 minutes defending the aid budget to a hall of Tory activists”.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And although we describe ourselves a nation of foodies, with the average Brit dining out at least once a month, the results found six in 10 play their meal choices \u0027safe\u0027 by eating at the same places, time and time again. The research was conducted by Meerkat Meals, who created a unique ‘Restaurant Roulette’ tool to help diners decide what to eat by picking from a list of cuisines. Julie Daniels of Compare the Market said: “Everyone loves dining out, and with such a wide selection of restaurants and cuisines so easily accessible, we’re a nation spoilt for choice. “However, the seemingly-simple question of \u0027What do you want to eat?’ can often become an excruciating conversation, and this in turn is meaning many are finding the whole experience dficult.\u0027\u0027 The study also found a common barrier to trying new eateries is the size of the dining group, with nearly half of those polled saying it\u0027s harder to pick a restaurant when eating out with four or more people.  It also emerged choosing where to eat in a group takes on average 25 minutes, which mounts up to over five hours over a year. The pressure of deciding where to eat amongst a group can even take the fun out of the evening, with almost half of diners saying choosing a restaurant that everyone likes takes the fun out of the experience. The research also found diners much prefer to eat out when the choice of restaurant is taken out of their own hands. More than one third agreed it was much easier when somebody else chose the dining destination. And when it comes to the culinary desires of the nation, Caribbean came out as the cuisine people would most like to try, with a fth of diners saying it was on top of their “to-try” list.

In a dramatic turn of events, Senator Jeff Flake said he would vote for Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination, but wanted a one-week delay so a \u0027limited\u0027 FBI investigation could take place. Now Donald Trump has ordered the FBI to respond over fears his party could lose the crucial Senate floor vote. I\u0027ve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh\u0027s file. As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week, Trump said in a statement. Eleven Republicans voted to accept Kavanagh\u0027s nomination, with 10 Democrats voting in objection, further exposing deep political isions on Capitol Hill. Senators held proceedings up for 20 minutes as they were involved in last-minute wrangling over their decision. The move follows a jarring and emotional hearing against the Trump nominee who was accused of sexually assaulting university professor Christine Blasey Ford in 1982, when she was 15-years-old. Earlier, angry Democrats walked out as the Senate Judiciary Committee in protest as Republicans pushed forward with the vote. What a railroad job, Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono said.  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the committee, praised Kavanaugh as he pressed forward with the vote. The alleged behavior is inconsistent with everything else we know about him, Grassley said of Kavanaugh. It was only fair that his accuser had the burden of proof. In my opinion, this wasn\u0027t met, Grassley added. The timing of the panel\u0027s session gave committee members little time to review Thursday\u0027s extraordinary testimony from Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. Kavanaugh forcefully denied the accusations and accused Democrats of a calculated and orchestrated political hit.  Senator Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the committee, criticized Kavanaugh\u0027s remarks, saying they were unseemly for a judicial nominee. This was someone who was aggressive and belligerent. I have never seen someone who wants to be elevated to the highest court in the country behave in that manner. In stark contrast, the person who testied yesterday and demonstrated a balanced temperament was Dr. Ford. She gave powerful testimony about her experience of being physically and sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh, Feinstein said. Brett Kavanaugh broke down in tears during the dramatic hearing in which he categorically denied sexual assault allegations made against him. University professor Christine Blasey Ford told the hearing she was 100 percent certain Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her 36 years ago. But calling himself a victim of grotesque and obvious character assassination, Kavanaugh said he unequivocally and categorically denied Ford\u0027s allegation.  He labelled other accusations of sexual misconduct also from the 1980s made by two additional women who did not appear before the panel as vicious and false. Ms Ford told the hearing she feared he would rape and accidentally kill her. But Kavanaugh insisted: I have never done this, to her or to anyone. A committee vote to approve Kavanaugh which pave the way for a final debate and vote on the Senate floor in the coming days.  Flake, who had raised concerns about the allegations, said on Friday morning he would vote in favor of the nomination. Flake said in a statement that while Ford\u0027s testimony was compelling, Kavanaugh gave a persuasive response.  Soon after Flake made his announcement, he was angrily confronted by protesters in an elevator while on his way to the committee meeting. If the nomination reaches the full Senate, where Trump\u0027s fellow Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority, the votes of two other so-far undecided Republican moderates could be crucial: Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. Democrats have urged a delay to allow for an FBI investigation, a move backed late Thursday by the American Bar Association, which had earlier endorsed his nomination. Why are they shutting it down? I believe it\u0027s because they are trying to hide something, Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat on the committee, told NBC\u0027s Today program on Friday. Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote on several contentious cases  he is confirmed, with disputes involving abortion, immigration, gay rights, voting rights and transgender troops possibly heading to the court soon. What happens next?  The Senate floor was expected to vote withing days of Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination but a dramatic intervention by Senator Jeff Flake has halted planned proceedings for now. Democrats had originally asked for an FBI probe into Blasey Ford\u0027s allegations but Republican lawmakers strongly rejected their proposals before the hearing. At news conference with Chile\u0027s President, Donald Trump told gathered White House reporters that he had been moved by Blasey Ford\u0027s testimony. I thought her testimony was very compelling, and she looks like a very fine woman, Trump said. He also said moderate Senators, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, must \u0027do what they think is right\u0027 when they cast their crucial votes.

If so, it might explain why we’ve still got the garden furniture out as we head into October. Not because of what’s in the sky but because it’s hard to recall a time when the so-called serious, grown-up events that are meant to shape the world have drawn so many belly laughs. Look at the entire United Nations General Assembly rolling around in stitches like Martian robots on the old Smash advert this week as the world’s most powerful man addressed them. When Donald Trump announced “my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of this country”, he was drowned out with guffaws. This has literally never happened in this very sombre organisation’s 73-year history. Was it his hair, the ease with which fiction leaves his puckered lips, or his rare show of modesty by using the word “almost”? Who knows.  But those delegates were smirking again when Trump accused the Chinese of interfering in US elections without mentioning the Russians, whose foreign minister stared at his phone, struggling to keep a straight face. Mind you, the rest of the world has been struggling to do the same ever since Vladimir Putin claimed the two hitmen he’d sent to Salisbury to take out Sergei Skripal were simply Songs of Praise fans who adored the cathedral so much they saved all their rubles to come over and gaze at its spire. Which was funny. But now it’s been revealed that one of those hitmen was an elite special forces colonel in Russian \u0026shyintelligence who was awarded the country’s top military honour, it gets even funnier. How less elite can a special forces spook be than one who leaves his grinning mug plastered all over CCTV street cameras? I know, one who can’t bump off a pensioner whose greatest pleasure appears to be sitting in pubs and restaurants supping lager. Not that us Brits aren’t coming up with the laughs. UKIP MEP Lord Dartmouth has quit the party because it’s become too racist. Eh? That’s like quitting Mumsnet because all the women keep banging on about babies. Why else did he join?  Then, after Jeremy Corbyn’s \u0026shyconference speech, there were the right-wing papers lampooning him in one breath as an eccentric Catweazle figure with loony policies, then in the next warning the Tories they need to take him seriously as a disillusioned Middle England could just buy them. Which brings us to Birmingham turning into Comedy Central next week when loose-dentured geriatrics spill their colostomy bags all over the Tory conference hall as their G-spots take direct hits from misty-eyed Brexiters fantasising about Victorian maids cycling through villages where everything, from the cricket flannels to the faces, are white.

Justin and Meg met at university and their relationship developed organically. We spent more and more time together. From the start, Justin always told me that he knew I was the one, Meg told HowHeAsked. But when her dad was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2014, times were hard for the couple. It was so rare that doctors have not found a cure yet. After my dad was diagnosed, Justin was always there for me whether it was a shoulder to cry on or someone to vent to. At the time, I wasn’t the easiest person to get along with. I was confused, angry and in denial. After my dad passed away a year later, things were tough. My dad was my best friend and to him, I was truly his “little girl.”  Justin knew how much my dad meant to me and how dficult it is to experience the big moments in le without him. The romantic decided that he would involve Gino, Meg\u0027s dad, in arguably the biggest moment of her le. Knowing that Gino\u0027s favourite animal was a flamingo, Justin bought a lovely solar-powered decoration for his grave so the couple could take it together one weekend. They chose the date, September 7, and Meg says she felt her dad was with her after a \u0027sign\u0027 when arriving at the cemetery. While I was driving to the cemetery it was pouring rain, she said. |As soon as I turned into the cemetery IT STOPPED. At that moment, I knew my dad was there with me. The grave was decorated beautully with flowers. In one of the flowers was a letter with a flamingo on it. On the front of the letter, it stated, “Dear Gino” which was my dad’s name.  Justin told Meg to open the letter and, as she read, she realised it was written from her boyfriend to her dad asking for his blessing to marry her. The last line said: “I hope you are smiling down on us during this moment… the moment I ask your daughter to be my we.” Meg slowly turned and realised Justin was down on one knee.

Almost a fth admitted to taking more than three photos just to perfect an “ I nstagram worthy” shot — stating that they feel the need to make their photos look as “polished” as the ones they see on social media platforms.

The research was commissioned by WaterWipes to mark a collaboration with famed party photographer Dave Benett who has captured a series of first birthday celebrations.

The weather will do a U-turn after this week\u0027s warm sunshine, light winds and pleasant temperatures that hovered in the teens. Instead, today could mark the last of the sun and the start of weeks of chillier weather and unsettled conditions that could continue throughout October. The Met Office is forecasting that temperatures will fall close to or a little below normal with some weather experts suggesting it could reach a low as -2 in Scotland while Wales and the north of England will see single digit figures. Today will not only bring frosts and freezing frogs to kick off the weekend, but the north of the country could also be battered by blustery showers and gale force winds.  The Met Office predicts today will be another fine day for England and Wales with long sunny spells, but it will be cloudier and windy elsewhere, with rain moving southeastwards across Scotland and reaching Northern Ireland by evening. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey added: “It is going to turn colder towards the weekend with a northerly flow of Arctic air bringing temperatures down compared to earlier in the week. “Overnight into Saturday we could see more widespread frosts with temperatures widely dropping, anywhere in the country could see a frost. “It will stay cooler into Sunday and after some morning fog, there is the likelihood of sunny spells with daytime temperatures around the mid-teens again.  “There will be blustery showers around on Saturday and along northern coasts, there will be the risk of gales. “Across the southern half of the country there is more of a chance of seeing some sunshine, the risk of frosts will continue into the start of next week. “There may be some sleet or wet snow over high ground in the north on Sunday night.” According to the Met Office tomorrow will be drier, but we can expect to see rain once again by Tuesday. A forecast read: Showers in north and east Sunday, these wintry over Scottish mountains. Dry with sunny spells elsewhere. Largely fine Monday, but rain reaches the northwest later, and clears southeastwards during Tuesday.

Julie Collier says she was horried and in a state of nausea after finding a cockroach in the own brand dessert. The 54-year-old, from Belle Vale, Liverpool, says she tasted something metallic, hard and sharp halfway through the trle and spat it out. It was then, she claims, that she saw the creature\u0027s legs.  Julie told the Liverpool Echo : Halfway through the trle I discovered an odd glass-like texture in my mouth and it tasted metalic.  I didn\u0027t bite down thankfully but spat it out into a tissue, that\u0027s when I saw the legs. I was left absolutely horried when I realised it was actually a cockroach. Julie said that the large insect was covered in jelly and cream when she threw it down on the counter in her kitchen.

I don\u0027t even think I\u0027ve ever seen a cockroach in this country. Pictures taken after Julie says she found the cockroach show it to be around the same size as a two pence coin, covered in raspberry jelly, with all six legs still intact. She had bought a two pack of trles at the Asda Superstore in Huyton as part of her weekly shop but says she is yet to receive a reply from the company after sending a complaint email to their customer service department.

Self-employed sports analytic Mike, 40, and special education teacher Kristina Green, 34, had been married for eight years when they decided to look for a girlfriend. The couple from Pennsylvania, USA, met therapist Ashley Sweet, who was married at the time but openly dating other people, through mutual friends at a social event. And they have now officially been a throuple for 10 months - despite some of their family members not approving of their unconventional relationship and receiving looks of disdain when they are out and about. Ashley, 31, said: Polyamory is about being open to more. More love, more partners, more experiences.  Society is largely centred around monogamy, this idea that there is only one \u0027person\u0027 for you. But what  there\u0027s more than one? Why should we limit ourselves because of a social rule? Having more than one partner means I see the world through my gaze, his gaze, and hers. My understanding of the world and what it has to offer is vastly expanded by being open to loving and sharing with more than one amazing person. She added: Our relationship works through open and honest communication, respect and consideration for one another\u0027s feelings and thoughts, and a willingness to compromise for the best interests of all. For a polyamorous relationship, we have to work harder on those things, because there are more needs, wants, feelings, thoughts and input at any given time. We are also all unique and dferent, and so rather than having to consider one partner\u0027s needs and dferences, we consider two. Occasionally one of us is on one side and another is on the opposite side of the issue at hand, and the need for respect and compromise becomes more important.  The three instantly clicked and started to date on a casual basis before Mike and Kristina asked Ashley to officially form a triad as they had fallen in love with her. Ashley and her husband separated as of July this year for reasons unrelated to their polyamorous lestyle, with him always being supportive of her relationship with Mike and Kristina. Kristina, Mike and Ashley have three children between them who they raise together - aged 11, seven and seven. Ashley works a busy schedule that often means she is away from the family home, so feelings of jealousy sometimes arise over the time that they get to spend with each other. But the throuple have now found a way to navigate these emotions and work through them together so that everyone feels included. The triad view their relationship as a triangular shaped unit with each person benefiting inidually from their unique setup. For Kristina, being in a triad has given her a female and male partner and allowed her to explore herself more than she did when she was in a monogamous relationship. From Mike\u0027s perspective, the triad means he receives more of everything he did before, and Ashley receives balance in her love le.  It allows for additional avenues to share and explore the world with people I care about, said Mike. Being poly gives you a dferent perspective on the world in general. We don\u0027t view things through the normal society\u0027s spectrum. Ashley continued: We talk a lot and have developed a POT  where we all hold hands and agree to listen without judgement to one another. Having a \u0027safe space\u0027 where we take time to consider our needs and be mindful of being respectful allows us to communicate more openly and honestly. There are often feelings of jealousy, particularly around time spent together. Ashley says she works an unconventional schedule in therapy and so spends more time away from home when the family is together, and admits she can sometimes feel left out. She said: We joked once, months ago, that we should have a word to express when someone feels left out without having to share the vulnerable feelings, because feeling left out in our triad is complicated, as you feel both excluded and guilty for potentially taking time from your partners. So now we say \u0027orangutan\u0027, which is comical, but also allows us to share when something or some configuration leads to feelings of exclusion. When we disagree, we sometimes talk in our triad, and sometimes  the disagreement is between a pairing, the third partner will try to bring the other two together to hash out the feelings and needs.  Despite being madly in love with each other, the triad have received mixed reactions from their family members ` with only Ashley\u0027s parents supporting their arrangement and willing to learn more. My birth parents and family seem more accepting and have been willing to listen and get to know Ashley, said Kristina. My adopted mother is not very accepting at this time, but my siblings are very supportive. Mike said his brother is tolerant, his sister is accepting, but his other sister has not approved. He explained: My family more or less disapproves, and my mother has refused to meet her [Ashley]. Most of my family hates our relationship. Ashley said: My parents have been surprisingly open and accepting. My mother will ask questions and my dad is supportive  confused. My sisters are a little less embracing: apart from the youngest, my sisters have expressed confusion, disapproval and concern for the best interests of their children as well as mine. I would say that my oldest truly understands the dynamic we have. I explained the relationship in the context of consent, that just like you wouldn\u0027t date or touch someone without consent, having more than one partner is allowed as long as everyone consents. He\u0027s been adjusting to having to listen to more adults, but he loves everyone.

Grabbing the hands of the nearest two strangers, Nicole Ruffino and her friend, he led them to take refuge inside a refrigerator truck backstage. And there, huddled together as more than 1,000 rounds from Stephen Paddock’s guns killed 58 people, Bryan kept Nicole safe – and fell in love. Now, days before the first anniversary of the worst mass shooting in modern US history, inseparable Bryan, 49, and Nicole, 25, reveal how they found each other while hiding from a killer. Bryan says: “October 1 will always stay with us because of that horric tragedy.  “But now this first anniversary is not just about remembering those that lost their lives, but celebrating how lucky I am to have met Nicole. “I remember telling Nicole that night I would always be there for her as words of support in that situation – but now those words have taken on new meaning. “It really was the key moment in my le. I held her hand and fell in love with her instantly.” Nicole took slightly longer to realise she had found love in the arms of the man who sheltered her. She says: “Bryan saved me that night, but in the next few months, I fell in love with a warm, caring, creative man, and I am so grateful.”  Bryan, a country music artist, was hailed a hero in the aftermath of the massacre. He and radiographer Nicole were strangers standing next to each other in the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when Paddock began firing from floor 32 of the Mandalay Bay hotel. Bryan took hold of Nicole and her friend Nicole Yorba and urged them to run. When they reached the backstage area, he led the women, and 30 others, into the catering fridge unit. Video shows Nicole cowering next to Bryan, who recorded a \u0026shyfarewell message for his parents in case he did not survive.  Bryan tried to calm the panicking group for around five minutes, before deciding they needed to clear the whole target area. Peering out of the door during a break in the shots, he noticed a metal ramp leaning against a 10ft fence. He hurried the group up the ramp and together, against the echo of gunshots and in total darkness, they ran into open ground towards the safety of the Strip. Afterwards, Bryan and Nicole appeared in dozens of media interviews retelling their traumatic experience while holding hands. “Holding her hand felt like the most natural thing to do as we did interviews together,” says Bryan. “It was subconscious and, truthfully, I never wanted to let it go.”  Bryan, lead singer with his band Elvis Monroe, threw himself into supporting the #Vegasstrong movement by performing at numerous fundraising concerts. On October 13, the band played at the Mandalay Bay and things changed for ever. Nicole says: “I wanted to see Bryan, but I was anxious about heading back to that hotel where the tragedy happened. “He met me in the parking garage for reassurance and held my hand and walked me in. Later, as we watched the acts, he had his hand on my leg. Afterwards, he walked me back to the car, opened the door for me, smiled and gently leaned in to kiss me. “I was taken by surprise and naturally leaned in to him. It was pure impulse for both of us. I never saw it coming, but my instincts just knew it was right.”  The pair began casually, and secretly, dating. But then, in November, Nicole was struck down with viral meningitis. Bryan was by her side during her three weeks in intensive care while specialists battled to treat the brain infection and then helped her back to full health for another six weeks. But then Nicole had second thoughts about how fast and intense their relationship had grown. She says: “I was worried about the big age dference and getting too involved. I insisted we’d just be friends.” Bryan was devastated. He says: “I did tear up, but I held on to my belief that we could still make it.” Bryan was right. Because Nicole soon realised just how much she missed him.

We just seem to be falling short just now and it’s not good enough.“There’s nothing else for it, it’s the same old cliched stuff – you’ve just go to keep fighting away.“You need to be ready to go on the training field, pushing yourself to the max every day.“We have to put in the hard yards and that’s the only way it will turn.“I know the fans and everyone at the club is frustrated, they’re obviously used to seeing better times than this, but there is still time to get our season going.“That’s the only positive – there’s another game in a few days’ time, a massive game against Hamilton and we’ve got to go and make sure we get a victory.“I know, it’s easy saying that and the punters will be sick to the back teeth of people saying ‘next week, next week’ but it’s the only thing for it.”Hamilton against Dundee has been a grudge match over the past few years and last season at New Douglas Park was one of the stand-out moments for the Dark Blues as they came from behind to win the game in the 97th-minute through A-Jay Leitch-Smith.Kerr added: “Last season at Hamilton was amazing, an incredible finish to the game and that again was a resilient performance full of character within the group.“It’s dficult being positive after Saturday’s defeat and having no points from the first six games but we have to go there, knowing how hard it is down there, it’s an absolute dogfight.“They got a great result last week but it’s a game of football, 90 minutes, and  we get ourselves on top we can win the game on Saturday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5badf0a726d59.jpg ","title":"coffee giant starbucks plans to open second drive thru in

Estate earlier this year, and has now submitted a proposal for another.If approved, the branch would occupy land on Afton Way, close to the city’s Morrisons store.Representatives for Morrisons, which owns the entire site at Afton Way, say the planned shop would match the “signicant” growth of drive-thru coffee shops across the country.It would also serve a iety of people from passing motorists on the A90 through to nearby residents.The new proposal,  approved by Dundee city planners, would also create new jobs, and contribute to ongoing regeneration efforts in the North East.In a statement, representatives for Morrisons said: “The proposed small-scale drive- thru unit will form a complementary addition to the existing Morrisons store.“It will also generate a number of job opportunities for local people.”The application also hints at further development to come at Afton Way.Initial talk of an expansion on the site began as early as January 2013 – with other potential developments in future including a pub.Diagrams included with the Starbucks proposals detail a new, more convenient entrance to the site from the southbound A90 Forfar Road.However, this is likely to form part of a separate planning application in due course.And Morrisons also had a plan to mody and expand its petrol station approved in October last year.Starbucks’ latest move to build on Dundee’s ring road comes at a time of intense interest from developers on the Kingsway.Alongside the now-opened Starbucks drive-thru at Myrekirk, plans have also been approved for a retail complex on Kingsway East at

dundee united boss is the hardest job in scottish football","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThere were some cursory glances around the Press room at the Falkirk Stadium after Dundee United’s 2-0 win on Saturday when boss Csaba Laszlo, almost out of nowhere, asserted the following.“The most dficult job in the Scottish Championship, or Scottish football at the moment, is to be the manager of Dundee United.”He qualied that statement by adding that it is also dficult for his players to pull on the black and tangerine but his remarks did pique the interests of those gathered.It wasn’t so much disagreement or astonishment that filled the room but more a sense of being taken aback by the brutal honesty of a man who has been under such pressure of late.He eased some of the weight on his shoulders with the result at Falkirk under what were strange circumstances – namely going up against predecessor Ray McKinnon in the opposite dugout for a side sitting bottom and pointless.And it was clear that, despite assertions by some that Csaba is daft or clueless, he was very aware of the ramications had he not got the right result.“We showed good team spirit under pressure, they handled it positively,” Csaba commented as he laid out his case to the gathered press.“Now we can close this chapter and look ahead to the next game which will be very dficult.“This is the third season where the fans have been disappointed to be in the second tier and we are talking about a very massive, strong and passionate club that wants to be in Premiership.“If something doesn’t go right immediately you have noise which is OK but we don’t want to hide behind anything.“We have this pressure and we have to accept.“We don’t want to spend one more year in the Championship – it’s not good.“The Dundee United fans don’t want to hear that from the board, the manager or anybody. They want to have the target of promotion and winning the league.“This is pressure, this is normal but you have to understand we have a budget that isn’t any higher than other teams in the main.“You have to bring a team together. We had 19 players leave and 16 players come in for the new season.“We can’t click our fingers and have the team work fantastically.“There are rules at the club about how many or which kind of players we can bring in within our budget.“It is not easy, we are not Manchester City with an owner behind you who can give you £20 million to go and spend.“We have to work with the budget we have to get the best for the club.“The Dundee United board have done a fantastic job. It is not easy to convince players from abroad to come to the Scottish Championship with everything else around.”It was quite a defence – but probably one that was coming after weeks of trying to keep a lid on it following poor results against Alloa and Morton.Yes, he has not had his troubles to seek with injury and scrutiny from all angles but it seems to be just the beginning for Csaba in his most tough of jobs.In the next four weeks they take on title rivals Ross County, Ayr United, Partick Thistle and Inverness. They kick off that run at home to County on Saturday.“I don’t just look at one game being more important than the other because you can’t afford to take any game lightly,” Csaba added. “You have to take every opponent seriously, whether they be at the top, middle or bottom of the league.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Xplore-buses.jpg-940x562.jpg ","title":"xplore bosses apologise for disruption to dundee buses due to driver shortage","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBUS bosses have apologised following claims dozens of services have been cancelled in the last few weeks.Xplore Dundee says a shortage of drivers is causing serious disruption to routes throughout the city.One passenger claims he spent almost an hour waiting for a service as a result.The Tele understands dozens of cancellations have occurred, with many being announced on electronic boards at bus stops.Normal service is still to resume, but a spokeswoman for Xplore Dundee said they are “seeing improvements”.She said: “We’re sorry for the disruption currently affecting some of the services in our network and for any inconvenience caused to customers.

He said: “Journeys are basically going missing as far as I can see.“I have a family member who works for Xplore and it seems drivers are going off sick and they can’t replace them.“Myself and other people have been waiting up to an hour for buses – it’s shocking.“It was only the other week that I was waiting on a bus to go to Charleston and all I was seeing on the electronic board was that it had been cancelled.“The company weren’t able to send another one on and I was having to wait, that really shouldn’t be happening.“As far as I am aware this has been going on for quite a few weeks now. There’s no signs of it getting any better but something needs to be done about it.“I was informed that the Traffic Commissioner was aware of it so hopefully they will take it seriously.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"                          AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged \u0026pound490 million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-glasgow-bar-named-scotlands-pub-of-the-year","story":"                          A Glasgow pub has been named the best in Scotland at a prestigious award ceremony."},{"url":null,"title":"lewis-morgan-kris-boyd-hasnt-a-clue-whats-going-on-inside-celtic-weve-a-close-knit-group-of-players","story":"                          LEWIS Morgan has denied that Celtic have struggled this season due to a split in the dressing room - and vowed to play his part in helping the Parkhead club get back to winning ways."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-cabbies-set-for-new-compulsory-qualification-to-stay-on-the-road","story":"                          Cabbies could soon be forced to gain a professional qualication to remain on Glasgow\u0026rsquo roads."},{"url":null,"title":"scotrail-staff-to-take-industrial-action","story":"                          SCOTRAIL staff are to take industrial action in a dispute over pay for working on rest days."},{"url":null,"title":"independent-review-of-football-policing-strategy-ordered","story":"                          AN independent expert will be commissioned to review policing at football matches."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-more-pupils-to-learn-cpr-as-8th-council-backs-evening-times-campaign","story":"                          INVERCLYDE has become the eighth council to commit to teaching all pupils le-saving CPR, in support of our Scotland\u0027 Got Heart Campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"rutherglen-trampoline-park-to-transform-into-drive-in-cinema-for-halloween","story":"                          A RUTHERGLEN trampoline park will transform itself into a spooky, drive in cinema for Halloween."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-woman-who-brings-the-biggest-stars-to-glasgow","story":"                          OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the world\u0027s biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair-cancels-250-flights-what-to-do-if-youre-affected","story":"                          Frustrated passengers were grounded on Friday after striking staff forced Ryanair to cancel around 250 flights, potentially affecting tens of thousands of customers across Europe."},{"url":null,"title":"everyman-cinema-glasgow-opening-date-announced","story":"                          A new boutique cinema will be opening in the City Centre at the end of next month."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock-and-hamilton-jobs-to-go-as-powerleague-to-shut-two-sites","story":"                          WORKERS at two five-a-side football pitch complexes are facing the axe as Powerleague announced the closure of its west Scotland sites."},{"url":null,"title":"take-that-fans-left-disappointed-after-glasgow-ticket-fiasco","story":"                          Take That fans have been left disappointed after failing to get their hands on tickets for their greatest hits show."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-some-of-the-acts-coming-to-the-venue-over-the-next-year","story":"                          \u0026ltBodyText\u0026gt"},{"url":null,"title":"couple-raffling-off-3m-mansion-for-just-25-a-ticket","story":"                          AN English couple have decided to raffle off their \u0026pound3 million house via an online contest."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117769.jpg","title":"Blainie 9 defies the odds in charity race","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn 2016, Blainie White  was diagnosed with a form of Batten disease which affects just eight people in the UK.

I decided to do something similar – something nice and simple that didn’t cost anything.“I decided to put them around Cove .“It’s meant to brighten someone’s day or maybe someone who finds it can hand it to another friend.”Jessica and her younger sister Amber O’Brien worked their way around the area to distribute the cards.She said: “She’s always on hand with anything I need help with, whether it be my work or help with my son.“I wouldn’t have, or couldn’t have, done it  I didn’t have her help.”The pair started at Cove Harbour before making their way through Old Cove, the Altens Community Centre and finished at the GP surgery.Jessica also hopes it can help people who might “suffer in silence”.She said: “A lot of people suffer with anxiety and depression and there’s still a lot of stigma surrounding mental health.“There’s a lot of people out there suffering in silence and I hope they can help someone who finds them or even someone can pass it on to someone who might need to hear something positive.“I don’t think one card will fix everyone’s problems, but one card, especially for somebody going through a dficult time, could help them feel better for a bit.”The mother-of-one takes her inspiration from the positive quotes she sees on social media and tries to put those messages on the cards.“I’m all about a positive mind and positive thinking.“People who follow me on social media know I’m always posting quotes about reminding yourself that you are beautul and confident.”Since Jessica planted the messages around Cove, people have reacted positively on social media and she is considering continuing the project.“At first, I wasn’t sure I should share what I was doing – I didn’t want it to be about the publicity,” she said.“But after a while, people started finding the cards and asking what they were about.“My sister told me ‘You should let people know why you’re doing this’.“The other day I drove through Cove and I noticed that a few of them were already gone.“It makes me feel amazing to know that there’s people out there picking them up.“I’ve seen posts on social media that said they found a card and that it brightened their day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high marks for aberdeen sheltered complex after surprise visit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA north-east sheltered housing complex has received high marks in an unannounced inspection.Bon Accord Care’s Coronation Court received a visit from the Care Inspectorate on August 22 and has received positive feedback.For quality of care and support, it received a rating of very good, and for quality of staffing it was marked as good.The report emphasised the good relationship staff had with the residents.It said: “People received compassionate care and support \u0026#8230 staff used their skills to build strong professional relationships with the people they supported.“People praised the staff highly and told us that their relationships with staff were very important to them.”The report also stated the care was well tailored to each of the residents.It said: “People had personal plans which showed how their care and support should be provided.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust. The next championships will be held at Inveralmond Community High School, Livingston, on Sunday March 10 2019.More details are on our website \u0026#8211 www.thechampionships.Last March, 145 schools from Scotland and two from England were represented at the championships, with a category for all standards of playing.Five years ago we introduced a new category of \u0026#8216freestyle\u0026#8217.  The aim of this is to provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their other musical skills alongside those of their pipers.The Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust  hopes many young pipers and drummers from Mid Argyll \u0026#8211 with other musicians too  entering the freestyle event – will participate in next year’s championships.Patrick Gascoigne, administrator, Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a sweet way to raise zambian money","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/09/18, 10:17 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe coffers of a Mid Argyll charity were boosted by the aroma of fresh coffee and lemon drizzle cake.People were drawn to Lochgilphead Parish Church Hall on Saturday September 15 for a fundraising coffee morning with plenty of home baking.The two-hour event raised £335, which will help ZamScotEd  with its work in Zambia, where it is completing a secondary school in the Lusaka area.The charity\u0026#8217s founder, Marian Pallister, said: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who helped us achieve this fantastic sum of money.\u0026#8217PICS:Four-year-old Lily with baby Natalie and mum Annie Galloway from Lochgilphead enjoying a cuppa and a cake. 06_a38ZamScotEd01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mojo 4 below","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 19/09/18, 6:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOctober is almost here, and that means so is MOJO 2018But  all you music makers, shakers and fans cannot wait until the big night, check out the MOJO Facebook page for demos, more information on each of the acts and their inidual social media accounts.4 Below is the new alternative rock creation of Oban musician, Andy Bruce.Taking up music in his teens, Andy initially learnt bass playing within a musical group of friends gaining lots of experience with bass.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

They heard there is a stigma associated with talking about loneliness and isolation but people of all ages are at risk of being lonely. It often occurs at times of change in people’s lives such as leaving home, starting a family, retirement or bereavement.A recent survey over the whole of NHS Highland, including Mid Argyll, found that 67 per cent of older people sometimes feel lonely and for eight per cent of respondents this increased to often feeling extremely lonely.Cumlodden Guild signed up to NHS Highland’s campaign called Reach Out – make a dference to someone who’s lonely, making a pledge to raise awareness in the church congregation and to talk about loneliness and isolation in their local communities.Alison McGrory said: \u0026#8216My job is about preventing health problems before they arise and enabling people to lead as healthy a le as possible. Loneliness is a bigger public health risk than physical activity or weight management and causes as many premature deaths as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. This is a compelling reason to take action.\u0026#8216NHS Highland’s Reach Out campaign has been developed to encourage more people to think about the part they can play in reducing loneliness. It costs nothing to reach out a hand of kindness and say hello to someone in the street or knock on a neighbour’s door to check they are OK.\u0026#8216You can sign up to the Reach Out campaign on facebook at NHS Highland Reach Out.\u0026#8217Sue Campbell of Cumlodden Church Guild said: \u0026#8216Cumlodden Church Guild is delighted to sign up to the Reach Out campaign. We are aware that isolation is an issue throughout Mid Argyll – some people live alone and others live in remote areas and find it dficult to get out and about.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op.32 No.12 as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer?Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse/harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills 2,000 years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead \u0026#8211 now wasted \u0026#8211 would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year\u0026#8217s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall \u0026#8211 this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £700 at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers \u0026#8211 Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £915.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The 10-year-olds ranked in the top 46 out of a whopping 600 youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing and  they liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P7 St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November 25 when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of 500 people and a panel of guest judges. And the youngsters only have 15 seconds left to learn of their 90-second dance. The cha-cha couple will also be fundraising to raise more monies for the charity. Good luck Jake and Olivia – and keep dancing!

Lisa revealed: “We must have visited more than 30 but were blown away by the approach of the Savoy Park. “Lots of places didn’t like the idea of a dog running around during the wedding, but the Savoy couldn’t have been more accomodating. “The three of us are going on a doggy-moon and will spend time glamping.

The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire. We want to encourage young people to take up the sport of golf.” Claire Monaghan, council head of community services and facilities, told the Leadership Panel: “ A lot of working is going on to pull all the strands together.” The politicians agreed the Ayrshire Golf Trust, which is spearheading the venture, could go ahead and apply for funding. She said there is a risk funds may be unavailable  there is a delay in applying. So far the The Ayrshire Golf Trust has consulted with local golf clubs, the public and residents.

This is simply not good enough and the SNP\u0026rsquos failure to deliver is holding Scottish businesses back and is unfair for consumers.\nThe report shows around a quarter of those in rural areas, such as the Borders, still cannot get speeds of 10mbps or more.\nThe European Union\u0026rsquos definition of superfast internet, which the Scottish Government has adopted, is 30mbps.\nBut local MSP Christine Grahame  said there were positives to highlight: \u0026ldquoBroadband access is in fact a matter reserved to the Tory UK Government, however  it hadn\u0026rsquot been for the intervention of the Scottish Government, the percentage of premises connected to fibre broadband in the Borders would be 39.3 per cent, rather than the current 91.4 per cent.\n\u0026ldquoThis report recognises that the roll out won\u0026rsquot be easy to deliver, but that is why this SNP Government has matched its ambition for broadband with \u0026pound600 million of investment \u0026ndash the biggest public investment ever made in a UK broadband project.\n\u0026ldquoI would highlight that the report also praises the Scottish Government for exceeding its target of 95 per cent fibre broadband coverage across Scotland by the end of 2017.\n\u0026ldquoAnd that, due to higher than expected take-up and lower than expected costs, the programme will in fact reach 60,300 more premises than planned \u0026ndash at no extra cost to the public sector.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos absolutely disgraceful that, despite being a reserved matter, the UK Government\u0026rsquos funding contribution to R100 is just three per cent of the total \u0026ndash perhaps Mr Lamont should focus on putting pressure on his colleagues in the Tory UK Government to step up to the plate and better support

He confirmed, however, that WhatsApp was not impacted by the breach.\nWhat has Facebook done?\nFacebook says it has already fixed the vulnerability and has informed law enforcement of the attack.\nIt has reset the access tokens of the hacked accounts, as well as another 40 million accounts that have been subject to a \u0026ldquoView As look-up in the last year.\nAs a result, around 90 million

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.  The next adviser training programme starts on Thursday, October 4.  Anyone interested in getting involved should pick up an application form from the CAB, which is located on High Street.

Lewis, of Dalkeith, is the current WTKA Scottish Champion, Sandee Open Intercontinental British Champion, Yokkao Open British Champion and SUSU Fighting Championship Champion. As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday, October 14.  He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip.

It was recognised as a provisional Olympic sport in 2016 meaning it will receive funding just under \u0026pound20,000 in annual funding from the International Olympic Committee.  The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.  Put forward by Councillor and Provost John McMillan, they are shortlisted in three categories: Performance/Development Coach of the Year, Club or Community Coach of the Year, and Sports Club of the Year.

Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award.

They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998.

Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.

The 21-year-old ran 100 kilometres to do her bit for the charity, which is close to her heart after her gran, Margaret Taylor, had dementia for about seven years.  Rhona said: \u0026ldquoI think as well as getting the donations throughout, it really did spur me on knowing I was doing something in memory of my gran.  \u0026ldquoSo many other people were doing the same challenge and being part of something bigger really helped.  \u0026ldquoThere were a lot of days where I did not want to go out for a run, especially in the heatwave.  \u0026ldquoIt was quite hard some days to keep going.  According to Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, more than 1,700 people across the county have been diagnosed with dementia, with that figure expected to double within the next 20 years.  University student Rhona previously told the Courier she was not a keen athlete but found she had come on leaps and bounds during the challenge, which she finished at the end of August.  She said: \u0026ldquoI really improved.  \u0026ldquoI think for the first month, the improvement was so slow and I was pretty worried but one of my last runs was an eight-kilometre run.  \u0026ldquoI could only run about a tenth of that in the beginning.  \u0026ldquoOnce I got over that hump, it was crazy \u0026ndash I was adding a kilometre every week to my personal best.  \u0026ldquoFor me, time did not really matter.  \u0026ldquoIt kind of came naturally and when I did shorter runs I was noticing I was getting a lot quicker but for me it was really about getting the distances since it seemed so unreachable for me in the beginning.  Rhona got involved with Dementia Friendly Haddington when she was still at Knox Academy.  She co-organised an event with fellow Knox pupil Kate Farmer at Haddington Day Centre, which saw an entire music class provide entertainment.  Since then, she has done her bit for dementia and Alzheimer-related charities, raising \u0026pound546 through the challenge, and has not ruled out lacing up her running shoes again in the future after finding it not only improved her fitness but her mental health too.  Speaking on Friday morning, the fourth year studying film at Edinburgh Napier University added: \u0026ldquoGenuinely, the reason I missed your call was I was about to go for a run.  \u0026ldquoThat would be my first since I finished the challenge.  \"I took a week off, I think I earned a week off but I am going to try to keep it up.  \u0026ldquoI expected to get fitter but did not really expect how much of an impact it would have on my mood.  \u0026ldquoJust genuinely you go for a run and there is no way you are going to feel bad afterwards.

In a post on the social network\u0026rsquos news site, Facebook vice president of product management Guy Rosen said a security breach affecting 50 million users had been discovered on Tuesday.  While the investigation is in its early stages, the firm said the hackers had exploited a vulnerability in Facebook\u0026rsquos code involving the \u0026ldquoView As feature, which lets people see what their own profile looks like to someone else.  In a later post, Facebook said the vulnerability had arisen from a combination of three distinct bugs, which meant the hackers were able extract other users\u0026rsquo access tokens \u0026ndash the equivalent of digital keys that keep people logged in to the Facebook app.          Sharing more technical details about the security issue we announced this morning https:t.co/JgOIeSNfjQ          \u0026mdash Facebook  September 29, 2018  It explained that when using the \u0026ldquoView As feature, the code had not removed the box that allows people to wish friends a happy birthday and incorrectly provided the opportunity to post a video.  In turn, the video uploader incorrectly generated an access tag that had the permissions of the Facebook mobile app. The third bug meant that the access token generated was for the user being looked up, instead of the person doing the viewing.  Pedro Canahuati, vice president of engineering, security and privacy, said: \u0026ldquoThe attackers were then able to pivot from that access token to other accounts, performing the same actions and obtaining further access tokens.  Who was affected?  Facebook has not revealed whether any UK users were hit, or where the hacked accounts were based, only saying that it had affected almost 50 million of its more than two billion users.  Mr Rosen said the attack could have given the hackers access to other apps  a user had logged into them using their Facebook name and password \u0026ndash and said the firm was investigating whether there was any access to Instagram accounts. He confirmed, however, that WhatsApp was not impacted by the breach.  What has Facebook done?  Facebook says it has already fixed the vulnerability and has informed law enforcement of the attack.  It has reset the access tokens of the hacked accounts, as well as another 40 million accounts that have been subject to a \u0026ldquoView As look-up in the last year.  As a result, around 90 million people were having to log back in to Facebook, or any of their apps that use Facebook Login.  What should I do to protect my account?  Following the announcement of the breach, Facebook issued guidance on the next steps to take.  While some accounts have been automatically logged out, no one needs to change their passwords, the firm said.  Those who were not logged out automatically, but want to log out as a precaution, should visit the \u0026ldquoSecurity and Login section which lists all the places a user is logged in to Facebook.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it.

The visual scars of the Highland clearances he saw half a century ago, the ruins and abandoned townships, had a profound impact on Sir Tom personally and professionally, inspiring much of the work he has undertaken since. And the fruits of this labour have been brought together in a ground-breaking new book that not only adds to our knowledge and understanding of the clearances north of the Highland Line, but also sheds new light on how dispossession impacted on the rest of Scotland.  Indeed, the volume challenges the narrative many Scots have told themselves and others for centuries: we will surely never again be able to refer to the destructive events of the 18th and 19th centuries as the \u0026ldquoHighland clearances.  The name of the book, The Scottish Clearances: A History of the Dispossessed, 1600-1900, highlights Sir Tom\u0026rsquos central premise that what occurred was a deliberate and nationwide process that affected lowland areas as much, arguably more so, than the Highlands. At the heart of the narrative is an evidentially robust but also often grim and very human story of how Scotland was transformed from the rural society of old to the largely urban nation we know today. The end of traditional Highland le is here, warts and all, but crucially so too is the far less well-known story of the demise of an entire class of lowland folk, the cottars.  \u0026ldquoOne of my main arguments is that the scale of land loss was greater in lowland Scotland and that the scale of landlessness at the end of clearance was also greater, explains Sir Tom.  \u0026ldquoWe all know about urbanisation but in terms of Scottish culture, the sheer scale of the revolution is not recognised. In early 18th century Scotland most people living outside the towns and cities of the lowlands and Borders had access to some land because to be without it in that subsistence society was to court survival itself.  \u0026ldquoBy about 1820 in the lowlands and Borders, the landholding society that had existed since time immemorial, including the quarter to a third of old rural population who were cottars, had vanished.  As Sir Tom points out, while the wounds around clearance, dispossession and forced emigration remain painful in the Highlands, recognised and revered around the world, kept alive and passed on through families and communities, there has been no such process of grief or remembrance for the lowlands.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been interested in puzzles, he says. \u0026ldquoOne of the big questions is this: why in many parts of Scotland did the dog not bark in the night? With the exception of a levellers\u0026rsquo revolt in the 1720s the process in the rest of the country was silent. There is no folk memory of dispossession and that led many people to think nothing had happened, that the whole thing was concentrated on Gaeldom and the Highlands, where it is still a live issue.  \u0026ldquoThe clearances are something everybody thinks they know about. This book is an attempt \u0026ndash and I\u0026rsquom glad to have been the historian to attempt it, because it\u0026rsquos been absolutely stimulating \u0026ndash to rewrite a central aspect of a nation\u0026rsquos history. It\u0026rsquos very unusual for a scholar to be able to do that, especially your own history.  Sir Tom believes English popular historian John Prebble, whose best-selling 1963 book The Highland Clearances is the sole source of many people\u0026rsquos knowledge of the subject, has much to answer for in terms of the mythmaking and politicisation that continues to surround this period of history. His new book tells a far more complex - but in many ways no less dramatic \u0026ndash story that covers improvement as well as loss.  \u0026ldquoPrebble and I share the same publisher and it was only while going through the Penguin archives that I discovered his book on the clearances is almost certainly the biggest selling on Scottish history of all time, says the Lanarkshire-born author and academic.  \u0026ldquoIn his terms the Scots are an ancient warrior race betrayed by their leadership class and pushed off their lands. That kind of human experience, that kind of story, is very attractive. It\u0026rsquos got a psychological impact that is dficult to dislodge.  \u0026ldquoBut the historian\u0026rsquos role is to be impartial and get as close to what happened and why it happened as possible. People interested in Scottish history in north America still see it through the prism of Prebble\u0026rsquos works. I quote in the book a fth-generation Scottish Texan lady who hired a genealogy firm to find out where she was from and discovered, like most 19th century immigrants, she came from lowland Scotland, in fact my own place of birth, Motherwell. She was not only displeased but for a time refused to pay them. She wanted Skye, and above all else she wanted a cleared township in Skye.  It will take time to wean north Americans off their overwhelmingly romantic view of Scottish history. But this is a book that is likely to ruffle feathers closer to home, too. Are we Scots ready to face and reassess our prejudices about the clearances?  \u0026ldquoYou get the sense that the Scottish nation is now a more confident and sophisticated place, says Sir Tom. \u0026ldquoPeople may be able to treat the arguments I put forward seriously, without indulging in outrage and invective against the author.

This latest 400-page tome joins the list of definitive \u0026ndash and also thoroughly entertaining \u0026ndash texts written by the historian over the last 40 years, a canon of modern Scottish history that covers rural society and urbanisation, the impact of Scots migrants across the globe, and Scotland\u0026rsquos role in the Empire and slavery, that is devoured and appreciated by academics and wider society alike at home and abroad.

So when Highland Council suggested that, rather than refurbish the dilapidated Strontian Primary School, the 30 or so pupils would be housed in portable classrooms instead, parents decided to take matters into their own hands.  So was launched an ambitious plan to raise enough money to buy a plot of land, construct a new school building and then lease it back to the council to help pay off the debt.  Volunteers brought in \u0026pound155,000 in community shares, which unlocked other funds such as land grants and bank loans.  Now, four years after the council\u0026rsquos original plans were rejected, the brand new \u0026pound900,000 school is finally ready to open its doors.  It is a remarkable moment for members of Strontian Community School Building Ltd who have fought so hard to make their dream a reality.  Jamie McIntyre, the group\u0026rsquos treasurer, said: \u0026ldquoThe council did a statutory consultation on three possible options, but unfortunately, their preferred option was not supported by the parents, so we had a wee bit of a stalemate.  \u0026ldquoQuite casually, we asked Highland Small Communities Housing Trust, which had some land available, how much it would cost to build a new school and, when we saw the costings, we thought it was possible.  \u0026ldquoSo we put it to the council and proposed the model we have here, which is that we finance, design and build the school and we lease it back to them for use as long they need it.  Headteacher Pamela Hill, is delighted with the development, describing the 1970s building as \u0026ldquodated and sad.  She said: \u0026ldquoThere wasn\u0026rsquot much space for us. We really needed a school that was a bit more up-to-date with technology suited for children for the 21st Century as well as somewhere where there is a bit more space for them as well.  The campaign attracted admiration from local politicians. Ian Blackford MP for Ross, Skye \u0026amp Lochaber, said: \u0026ldquoAll those in the community who have made this happen should be congratulated on providing what is a first class facility.  \u0026ldquoThis shows how local people can understand how they can deliver the needs of the local community whether that is education or other vital services.  \u0026ldquoWe need to make sure we give sufficient support to communities on the ground like this and that public authorities are not putting unnecessary hurdles in their way.  Highland councillor Andrew Baxter said the work of Strontian\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquovery talented community could inspire others.  He said: \u0026ldquoI think other communities in the Highlands and across the whole of Scotland could be looking at this and saying that they too could do something like this.  The long term future of the building as a school is still a little uncertain beyond the next decade because there is a break in the lease with the council - although it could run for at least 15 years when the community debt would effectively be cleared.  At that point the council could consider moving the primary pupils into a facility on the grounds of the nearby secondary school - a move which is not possible at the moment under the terms of its PFI contract.  However, whatever the future holds for pupils attending the new Strontian Primary School the building has been specically designed with the longer term in mind.  Part of the design brief was to create a building that could be converted into four affordable homes to benefit the Strontian community further.  Mr McIntyre said the plan is an example of how a community can design services for itself in a joined up way, rather than looking at assets on an inidual basis.  But he also argues there are crucial lessons to be learned about the way communities should be encouraged and supported in development projects.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are all obviously delighted with the new school, but we have had a lot of sleepless nights.  \u0026ldquoThere were times when it seemed it just would not happen and what we want to make sure is that, when communities are working to provide facilities in this way, public bodies do their utmost to support them."},{"url":null,"title":"first-minister-backs-incredibly-valuable-herald-campaign-to-celebrate-stem-innovations","story":"  Her comments come as The Herald launches a campaign to celebrate the remarkable contribution the nation makes to global developments in Stem.  Over the next year our paper will highlight the achievements of our brightest academics and spotlight how research and skills development in our universities and colleges drives progress.  The campaign will also seek to encourage a new generation of enquiring minds to pursue a career in Stem.  Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoI want Scotland to be the inventor and producer of the innovations that shape the future.  \u0026ldquoCampaigns like this are incredibly valuable in helping to tell the stories of how Scots have shaped the world and continue to do so.  \u0026ldquoChange and innovation are happening all around us in the workplace, the economy and our everyday lives - this is driven largely by developments in Stem.  \u0026ldquoWe know these sectors of the economy are growing quickly and it is likely that they will continue to do so and we have an opportunity to have an innovative, growing economy in Scotland.  The First Minister urged Scotland to \u0026ldquoseize that opportunity by supporting the development of a skilled and adaptable workforce that can take advantage of the growing number and evolving range of Stem jobs.  \u0026ldquoI hope this campaign will help inspire young people to do just that, she said.  The Stem campaign, which is run in partnership with Glasgow University and City of Glasgow College, was also backed by Susan Aitken, leader of Glasgow City Council.  She said Stem was a key driver for the development of skills and knowledge that were at the heart of the development of Glasgow\u0026rsquos future economy and prosperity.  She said: \u0026ldquoDeveloping an understanding and knowledge of Stem is important to all of our daily lives and it is essential that we support our young people \u0026ndash tomorrow\u0026rsquos workforce - to become scientically and digitally literate citizens.  \u0026ldquoWe have a very active Stem team at the council with a vision that our young people, educators and partners work collaboratively to support the development of knowledge, skills and opportunities.  CBI Scotland also backed the campaign, saying it was vital more young people were encouraged into Stem.  A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see an approach which encourages young people into these vital subjects.  \u0026ldquoBusinesses tell us access to skills is their number one concern and,  we want to build a successful modern economy, increasing uptake of Stem subjects is the foundation for that.

The warning came after Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, cautioned the EU27 that the UK would \"not keep coming back\" to the negotiating table with more Brexit proposals and that it had to start engaging seriously to avoid a clf-edge Brexit.  In Brussels for a meeting with the EU\u0026rsquos Michel Barnier, Jeremy Corbyn warned that a no-deal risked a \u0026ldquonational disaster and, after his talks with the Commission\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, said: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously not negotiating. We are not in government, we are the Opposition.  \"But he was interested to know what our views are and the six tests we have laid down by which we will hold our government in future.\" These include how any EU deal must deliver the \u0026ldquoexact same benefits as Britain\u0026rsquos current membership of the bloc.  In response to questions over delaying Article 50  there were a snap election or second referendum, the Labour leader added: \"Obviously, it would depend when the election is what the scenario would be. We would want to maintain the relationship with Europe around the six tests.\"  The BCC\u0026rsquos survey of more than 2,500 firms across the UK revealed that one in five would cut back on investment  there were no-deal and a similar number would move part or all of their business to the EU or cut back on recruiting staff.  Adam Marshall, its Director General, said: \"Businesses are clear that reaching a deal with the EU, which addresses the future terms of trade and provides certainty, must be the Government\u0027s number one priority.  \"Our evidence is clear: failure to reach a political agreement would have real-world consequences with signicant decreases in both investment and recruitment.  \"Larger firms and those active in international trade would suffer the most from a disorderly and sudden exit from the EU but there will be impacts across the board.  Mr Marshall said most concerning of all was how a \u0026ldquomaterially signicant number of businesses were considering moving part or all of their operations to the EU in the event of a no-deal.  \"Government must act urgently and decisively to get a comprehensive deal done. They also need to use the levers they have, such as the upcoming Budget, to ensure they provide the right conditions for growth at home.\"  At the United Nation in New York, Mr Hunt stressed how Britain had put practical proposals on the table, which honoured the result of the EU referendum and would ensure there was frictionless trade.  But he pointed out: \"Negotiations require two parties to engage seriously, that hasn\u0027t been happening and Britain is not going to keep coming back with more.  The Secretary of State insisted the UK\u0026rsquos proposals were \u0026ldquosensible and what was needed now was for \u0026ldquosome engagement from the EU.  He told Sky News: \"At this stage in the negotiations it was always going to be like this there was always going to be a moment where everyone was looking into the abyss. But now what we need is calm heads to prevail.  \"We need people to look at the very practical proposals that the Prime Minister has put on the table and when they look at them, they[will] realise that this is a very sensible way to deal with all the dferent tensions, all the dferent trade-offs.\"  Mr Hunt also batted off suggestions that the Prime Minister had been humiliated at the Salzburg summit, when EU leaders publicly rebuffed her plans.  \"Don\u0027t underestimate Theresa May. What\u0027s happening at the moment is that after that very dficult General Election, maybe some people in Britain didn\u0027t appreciate the steel at the heart of that lady.  \"We are led by someone very tough and very resilient,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"maid-of-the-loch-charity-devastated-by-37m-funding-setback","story":"  But it promised that the decision \u0026ldquois not the end of the road and said it still firmly believes in the project.  John Beveridge, Chairman of Loch Lomond Steamship Company, which has spent years restoring the Loch Lomond vessel, said after learning of the news: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely devastated with the Heritage Lottery Fund\u0026rsquos decision not to grant funds to the Maid. It is going to take some time to absorb this news and the reasons behind it.  \u0026ldquoIt was HLF that encouraged us to apply. The West Dunbartonshire area was a top priority for them and we really felt we put forward a strong case for the funding - not just for what the donation would represent in transforming the ship, but for what it would bring to the area and indeed Scotland as a whole  Maid of the Loch was to sail once again. This had been reinforced by an award of almost \u0026pound1 million from the Scottish Government.  \u0026ldquoUnfortunately, this decision jeopardises the whole project, and our vision for refurbishing the ship now hangs in the balance. Our team of dedicated volunteers, our board of Directors, tour guides, maintenance and so many more hard-working and passionate iniduals, have worked incredibly hard over the past 22 years to protect and preserve our much-loved paddle steamer.  \u0026ldquoTo have to explain to them that we won\u0026rsquot be sailing next year after all is extremely tough.  Mr Beveridge said the charity had succeeded in raising the equivalent of \u0026pound2.3m towards the restoration of the Glasgow-built Maid, which was launched in 1953 and carried some three million day-trippers, including royalty and celebrities, before it was decommissioned in 1981.  The group received an HLF \u0026lsquostage 1\u0026rsquo development grant of \u0026pound152,000 in 2015 to enable it to progress the project, and it pledged to raise \u0026pound1.7m in order to bid for further HLF funding of \u0026pound3,640,000.  Mr Beveridge said that for such a small charity, with only nine directors and 40 volunteers to raise the equivalent of \u0026pound2.3m towards the restoration was \u0026ldquosomething we are extremely proud of. Moreover, for the likes of the Scottish Government, West Dunbartonshire Council, the Robertson Trust, the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society and so many other funders to have faith in us and support our cause over the years, is something we are incredibly grateful for, and we are sorry to disappoint them too.  \u0026ldquoThe Maid\u0026rsquos  to sail would have been the single biggest project to take place in South Loch Lomond in more than 20 years, and it\u0026rsquos a huge blow to the area now that this \u0026pound6m regeneration programme will not take place. The effects of this decision will be felt by the whole community.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a very sad day indeed and does not auger well for the future of our industrial heritage. For now, we will take some time to reflect on this news and discuss as a team where we go from here.  Lucy Casot, Head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe understand this will be very disappointing news for the many dedicated volunteers involved with the Maid of the Loch. Returning the paddle steamer to full operation is a complex and specialised project with many challenges and risks.  \u0026ldquoHLF has a high level of competition for grants at every stage of the applications process and we are unable to support all of the applications we receive. We have to make dficult decisions and weigh up benefits with risks. Unfortunately, in this competitive situation the Board felt that other applications for funding were stronger and they were unable to support this project. We recognise the heritage importance of the Maid of the Loch and remain supportive of its long-term sustainability as a visitor attraction  Yesterday, after a scheduled board meeting of the Loch Lomond Steamship Company, Mr Beveridge told The Herald: \u0026ldquoWe felt so confident that we had everything all ticked and wrapped up. We\u0026rsquod done everything we thought we were supposed to do with them, but we understand that the decision was taken by HLF in London. We\u0026rsquoll be meet HLF next week in Edinburgh so we\u0026rsquoll get some feedback then.  \u0026ldquoThis would have been a \u0026pound6 million investment in West Dunbartonshire, the biggest in the area for 20-odd years.  Asked  there were alternative funding sources to be explored, he said: \u0026ldquoWe will need to look at that, because a lot of our current funding sources were there on the basis of our getting the full HLF funding. We will need to go back to existing funders and explain the situation and find out what their reaction is.  \u0026ldquoThe board is determined to fight on. We believe so much in the project and what it can do for the area, that we will not let this get in our way. It\u0026rsquos a setback, but we will have to come up with a dferent route.  Martin Docherty-Hughes, SNP MP for West Dunbartonshire, tweeted: \u0026ldquoDevastating news that the @heritagelottery has not approved the funding promised to help get the Maid of the Loch sailing again. The Maid is an important part of West Dunbartonshire\u0026rsquos cultural heritage, enjoyed by many people from across Scotland and all over the world. I will be offering my full support to ensure the ambitious efforts to restore the Maid to her former glory are not derailed as a result of this baffling decision."},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-the-political-diary","story":"  OUR item about Tory chair Sir Edward Mountain hunting a mole on Holyrood\u0026rsquos rural committee has caused ripples.

A majority of SNP councillors banded together with some Liberal Democrat, Green, independent and Labour members to defeat the ruling Tory administration.  Now\u0026nbspthe Scottish Tories\u0026nbsphave accused the SNP of \"betrayal\" after some nationalists backed the move for a vote on the Brexit deal terms.  The symbolic council decision - the first of its kind in Scotland - puts the SNP councillors who voted in favour at odds with their party position on a \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she will not stand in the way of a People\u0027s Vote but has not backed the campaign, raising concerns over the possibility of Scotland again voting to remain but the UK as a whole voting to leave.  However constitutional relations secretary Mike Russell told MSPs he has had \"very constructive\" talks with the People\u0027s Vote campaigner Hugo Dixon.  Tory MP David Duguid, who represents the Aberdeenshire constituency of Banff and Buchan, said he was \"astonished\" some SNP councillors representing fishing communities backed the People\u0027s Vote.  He said: \"The British people - including those here in Banff and Buchan - voted to leave the EU.  \"People voted to leave for a number of dferent reasons.

The Tories accused the SNP of \u0026ldquobetraying the fishing communities of the north east, who voted heavily for Brexit in order to leave the Common Fisheries Policy.  The LibDems also said the vote was embarrassing for Nicola Sturgeon, as it showed her councillors had shown more leadership on a People\u0026rsquos Vote than she had.  Both the original Green motion and an SNP amendment included the demand for \u0026ldquoa further referendum to give the UK public the final say on any terms agreed for Brexit, that referendum to include the option of the UK remaining in the EU.  Among those SNP councillors supporting it were representatives from the coastal wards of Fraserburgh, Banff, Troup and Peterhead.  As the council has no power over another referendum, the vote was symbolic, but was still the first of its kind in Scotland and pointed to a potential sht in SNP attitudes.  Ms Sturgeon has refused to endorse a People\u0026rsquos Vote on the final Brexit deal, apparently worried about setting a precedent that could lead to re-run of a Yes vote on independence.  However with the Labour party edging toward the LibDem position of backing another referendum, the First Minister does not want to be left closer to the Tories, who oppose it.  David Duguid, the Tory MP for Banff and Buchan, said he was \u0026ldquoastonished that SNP representatives in fishing communities would try to revisit the 2016 result.  He said: \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave for a number of dferent reasons. But in coastal communities like those across Banff and Buchan, many people just wanted out of the CFP.  \u0026ldquoFailure to respect the outcome of the vote would be an utter betrayal of our fishermen and a travesty for democracy in this country.  \u0026ldquoThe question for Nicola Sturgeon is \u0026ndash does she agree with her SNP councillors in Aberdeenshire and is she also willing to disregard the views of our fishermen?  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: \u0026ldquoThis is a lightning bolt from the grassroots targeted right at the SNP and Labour leaderships.  \"The First Minister says she will not stand in the way of a People\u0027s Vote but she is having to be dragged to the table when she should be out front passionately making the case for the whole of the UK to remain in the EU. The public must be given their right to avert economic disaster with a final say on the Brexit deal.\"  Aberdeenshire SNP councillor Richard Thomson said his group had recognised the severe damage Brexit would have upon Aberdeenshire, which the Tories seemed to be ignoring.  He said: \u0026ldquoThat damage will be acutely felt by key North East industries such as our food and drink and oil and gas sectors.  \u0026ldquoWhen jobs are lost, the Tories will be to blame.  \u0026ldquoWhen exports of Scottish seafood face y delays at the border, the Tories will be to blame. And when our fishing fleet is sold out as part of a Brexit trade-off, the Tories will be to blame.  \"It is simply a fact that to protect jobs and household incomes after Brexit we must remain in the single market and customs union.  \"Meanwhile, we\u0027ll leave the Tories to act as cheerleaders for Theresa May\u0027s botched negotiations, as they ignore the will of people in Aberdeenshire and across Scotland who voted to Remain in the EU.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8747311.jpg?type=article-full","title":"commercial-focus-when-you-want-quality-and-expertise-make-sure-its-made-in-scotland","story":"  Blair and Sheridan were formed by Douglas Blair \u0026amp Roddy Sheridan back in 2012.

Co-founders of Essence of Harris, Jamie and Deenie started their journey into candle and home fragrance by pouring around 12 candles a day on their kitchen table for a small following of island locals. Since the beginning, they have followed the ethos of keeping the brand natural, local and affordable using their beautul island home as inspiration for their products.  They have grown their beloved craft into a bustling candle business, boosting employment within the fragile island economy on the Isle of Harris. Candles were one thing that they both immensely enjoyed having in their home yet there wasn\u0027t anyone creating the products in the Hebrides.  Inspired by the elements of the island, particularly the beaches, they started experimenting with dferent scents and candle making at home. However as the company grew, In its very first year they gained their very own production unit, allowing them to employ a great close-knit team, and supplying to a number of Scottish stockists including the departure lounge of Inverness Airport.  Indeed, with five luxurious scents each named after the stunning west Harris beaches, the \u0027Essence of Harris\u0027 brand is now stocked in over 40 retailers across Scotland with sales abroad also on the increase via sales reps.  There\u0027s a real interest in the candles and home fragrance among tourists who are blown away by the scenery on Harris and want to take a part of Harris home!  \u0026ldquoThe rugged natural beauty of the island inspires everything we do.

Pupils enrolled in Higher English are increasingly choosing to study horror films instead of more traditional literary texts.  The Scottish Qualications Authority  said classic literature such as Shakespearean plays were still by far the most common choice alongside works by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.  But the SQA said: \u0026ldquoAn increased number of candidates chose to write their essay on a media text.  \u0026ldquoIn this genre, popular choices were the films The Dressmaker, The Shining, The Sixth Sense, Psycho, The Prestige, Shutter Island and Pleasantville.  The wider trend towards films is also apparent in National 5 English qualications, with ten per cent of pupils choosing films including The Dark Knight and Psycho.  Author Raymond Soltysek, a former teacher and co-ordinator of the Scottish Association for the Teaching of English, believes the trend is a positive one in a world where most communication is delivered through some form of visual medium.  And he argues that studying a film rather than a book is just as complex and rewarding.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are saying to pupils that what they have before them is a text and the fact they are watching it rather than reading it is really immaterial.  \u0026ldquoPupils still have to use a whole range of literacy skills to understand and interpret it so, just as in a printed text, they would have to look at metaphor and simile, characterisation and setting.  \u0026ldquoGiven the vast majority of people in western society now get their messages in some kind of visual form it is really important that we recognise that.  Mr Soltysek said the use of films in Higher English, which was established more than 20 years ago, would grow, but it would never replace literature. And he dismissed suggestions it was an \u0026ldquoeasy option.  \u0026ldquoThe core of an English teachers work will always be literature, but I have alway avoided film because it has been too hard for me to do.  \u0026ldquoIt requires an awful lot of technical knowledge of filmmaking skills that I find dficult. I would much rather teach Shakespeare than a film to any level of pupil.  Dr David Sorfa, a senior lecturer in film studies at Glasgow University, said films and the moving image more widely deserved their place alongside classic literature.  He said: \u0026ldquoEven great Shakespeare lovers basically know his works from film and television.  \u0026ldquoThey may have half red Hamlet when they were forced to at school or university, but, like Shakespeare, a lot of our knowledge about history, literature and the world comes from cinema and television.  \u0026ldquoThe sense that film or even television is in some way a lesser art form or something that isn\u0026rsquot as interesting is wrong because it opens up the world of literature which can be very closed to young people.  Dr Catriona Miller, senior lecturer in media policy, history and theory of film at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the horror genre had always been associated with teenagers as far back as Gothic literature.  She argues such films serve an important purpose because they help teenagers decode who they are.  She said: \u0026ldquoTeenagers are dealing with an emerging sense of self in terms of who they are and who do they want to be and, at the same time, they are having to negotiate who they are inside and what do they want to show the world.  \u0026ldquoThat is tough and scary to deal with and the horror genre deals with a lot of these questions in a very direct way, but with the added safety net that it is not real.  \u0026ldquoYou can risk staring the monster in the face and how to deal with it because it is not a real thing.  Ms Miller does not believe films like The Shining, which is rated 18, are too scary for teenagers, arguing they crave a real fright rather than one which is \u0026ldquodesigned for them.  \u0026ldquoSome of the films that are made specically for teenagers are not actually scary enough. They have to feel a real sense of jeopardy.  Filmmaker and critic Mark Cousins also welcomed the greater use of horror films.  He told the Times Educational Supplement Scotland: \u0026ldquoThese are works of art which allow pupils to engage with deep questions of fear and identication. It\u0026rsquos snobbery to suggest that great horror cinema shouldn\u0026rsquot be used in teaching."},{"url":null,"title":"private-school-drama-teacher-sacked-over-deeply-disturbing-allegations","story":"  Daniel McLean-Steel, 49, was suspended by the headmaster of Loretto School in Musselburgh two weeks ago.  Dr Graham Hawley said in a statement issued on September 12 that he was \u0026ldquodeeply disturbed by these allegations and I take them very seriously. The alleged behaviour is unacceptable. It is everything that we are not.  Hawley contacted parents today to inform them that McLean-Steel\u0026rsquos employment had been \u0026ldquoterminated.  Hawley said: \u0026ldquoThe investigation has necessarily been a complex, detailed, and thorough undertaking, and we have worked as expeditiously as we have been able.  \u0026ldquoUnderstandably, during this period there have been a range concerns and questions, and I hope that our personal responses to each have, wherever possible, served to inform and reassure you and others in so far as we have been able.  \u0026ldquoThe investigation has now been completed, and the outcome of the process has been to terminate the employment of a member of staff, Mr Daniel McLean-Steel.  Hawley told parents he expects questions about the \u0026ldquonature of the complaint but he did not reveal any details in his statement \u0026ldquofor legal reasons, despite also confirming that there is no active police investigation.  He said: \u0026ldquoAs I have already indicated in my letter and statement of Wednesday 12 September 2018, the allegations were in relation to behaviours which are unacceptable and have no place in our community, and the investigation has found this to be the case.  \u0026ldquoI can confirm that there is no active police case in association with this matter at this time, and I can also confirm that the allegations presented did not relate to current pupils of the school. For legal reasons, it is not appropriate that I make further comment on this.  The headmaster told parents he has begun a recruitment process to find a new head of drama.  He also urged parents to contact him with further concerns.  When the allegations emerged Hawley said he had alerted the Care Inspectorate.  A spokesman for the Care Inspectorate said today: \u0026ldquoWe are aware of an alleged incident at this school and are satisfied that the school have responded appropriately. We remain in close contact with the school. Anyone with a concern about a care service is encouraged to contact us.  McLean-Steel could not be reached for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"kezia-dugdale-gets-new-help-to-defend-wings-legal-case","story":"  The former Scottish leader is being aided by the Daily Record as she defends a \u0026pound25,000 defamation suit brought by Stuart Campbell, who runs the Wings Over Scotland website.  In a Record column last year, Ms Dugdale accused Mr Campbell of making a homophobic remark about gay Tory MP David Mundell - something Mr Campbell vigorously denies.  The development comes amid growing ision in Scottish Labour over the party\u0026rsquos decision to end funding to Ms Dugdale, and criticism of current leader Richard Leonard.  Many in the party are appalled at Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos apparent failure to stand up to Labour HQ on Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos behalf.  One source said: \u0026ldquoPeople are starting to wonder  he\u0026rsquos spineless or powerless. It\u0026rsquos probably a bit of both. He could pick up the phone to Jeremy Corbyn at any time, but he seems to think he won\u0026rsquot be listened to.  Clare Lally-Steel, Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos Carer\u0026rsquos Champion under leader Johann Lamont, publicly announced on Friday that she was leaving the party over Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos treatment.  She tweeted: \u0026ldquoThis makes me weep!! I am appalled that the Labour Party have treated her like this after everything she has done \u0026amp continues to do. This was the final nail for me, I will be cancelling my membership.  But the pro-Corbyn Campaign for Socialism said it supported the withdrawal of funding.  \u0026ldquoThe use of vast amounts of money to fight a court case that was triggered by an MSP in their own private column is neither prudent nor fair, it said in a statement.  After Mr Campbell, 50, launched a defamation action at Edinburgh Sherf Court, the Record initially offered to support Ms Dugdale, but Labour took over the case.  Ms Dugdale says then general secretary Iain McNicol agreed all her costs would be met.  However earlier this month, with the legal bill approaching \u0026pound100,000, new general secretary Jennie Formby pulled the plug.  It left Ms Dugdale facing large fees to carry on, as well as potentially ruinous costs for Mr Campbell\u0026rsquos damages and expenses.  It is understood the Record\u0026rsquos support for Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos defence is step-by-step, starting with an appeal against a recent sherf\u0026rsquos decision to hold an evidential hearing, and does not cover damages and expenses  she loses.  Ms Dugdale, a Lothians list MSP since 2011, this week said she felt \u0026ldquocrushed and suffered one of her \u0026ldquolowest personal moments when she heard Labour had ended its support.  She said she feared she would be made bankrupt and be disqualied as an MSP.  She also revealed she had texted Mr Corbyn about the matter, but he had not replied.  Ms Dugdale opposed Mr Corbyn becoming UK Labour leader, and her supporters suspect the end of the party\u0026rsquos legal support is connected to her lack of support for Mr Corbyn.  Amid accusations of a \u0026ldquobetrayal, and facing calls to reverse the decision in a high-profile vote at the party conference in Liverpool, Labour bosses this week agreed to reconsider the decision, referring it to the National and Scottish executive committees.  However this is likely to take several weeks.  Labour defended its action, and said party funds were better spent on campaigning,  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoKezia Dugdale has received signicant support from the Labour Party. The Party has a responsibility to all our members and that must mean spending our members\u0026rsquo fees responsibly and appropriately.  \u0026ldquoWe have to present and campaign around our message of hope and the need to Rebuild Britain and that is where we believe our members wish to see their fees spent."},{"url":null,"title":"senators-vote-for-kavanaugh-nomination-but-only-after-weeks-fbi-investigation","story":"  But his confirmation still remains uncertain as Republican leaders agreed to ask for a new FBI probe into sexual assault allegations facing the judge.  Jeff Flake, the senior Senator from Arizona, supported the vote to pass the nomination from the Judiciary Committee to the full Senate.  After dramatic last-minute negotiations, though, the key Republican senator said he wanted a week\u0026rsquos delay in confirmation hearings for Judge Kavanaugh to enable the investigation to happen.  Mr Flake said he would not support his confirmation without this. The final vote went ahead and was 11-10.  It came after testimony from Christine Blasey Ford \u0026ndash a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University in Calornia \u0026ndash transfixed the United States, as she claimed Judge Kavanuagh sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when they were teenagers.  Ms Ford said the attack was burned in her memory and she was \u0026ldquo100% certain that it was Judge Kavanaugh who attacked her.  He also testied on Thursday, furiously denying he had ever assaulted her or anyone else. He also accused Democrats of politicising the process and said that his family and his name \u0026ldquohave been totally and permanently destroyed.  President Donald Trump has nominated Judge Kavanaugh for a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the body that has the final word on key issues like abortion and same-sex marriage.  If he succeeds, his appointment could sht the balance in favour of conservatives for years to come. Judges are appointed for le, and as he is relatively young at 53, he could serve for decades.  Mr Trump yesterday said the hearing was an incredible moment in the history of the country and called Ms Ford a \u0026ldquovery credible witness.  \u0026ldquoI just want it to work out well for the country. If that happens, I\u0026rsquom happy, he added.  He continued to support Mr Kavanaugh, saying he had not thought \u0026ldquoeven a little bit about a replacement.  Last night, the President officially ordered the FBI to conduct a \u0026ldquosupplemental investigation into the allegation, saying the probe \u0026ldquomust be limited in scope and completed in less than one week."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie pub listed in camra good beer guide","story":"        An Inverurie pub has been acclaimed for the quality of its real ale by members of the town\u0026#8217s Campaign for Real Ale  branch.

The Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland is performing at venues across the country as part of its ‘Walking with Heroes’ centenary tour which is aiming to raise tens of thousands of pounds for Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.                                                    Fresh from another incredible month of spectacular performances at the world-renowned Edinburgh Tattoo, Scotland’s State Band, as it is also known, will be performing at the Beach Ballroom on Friday, September 28.                                                     Members of the band local to the area recently joined Aberdeen Provost Barney Crockett and the Poppyscotland team to spread the word about the eagerly anticipated concert.        Lord Provost Crockett said: “It is an honour to welcome the Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland to Aberdeen. “We are very fortunate that the Beach Ballroom has been chosen as one of the venues for the band to play on its seven-date centenary tour. “I would also like to take this opportunity to wish them well in meeting their fundraising targets for the very deserving Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.”Starring in the Beach Ballroom show will be hometown heroes LCpl Mark Angus and LCpl Natalie Mair.                                                                                                         Both hail from Aberdeen originally, and the September concert will mark the first time either has performed during their military career in the Granite City.LCpl Angus, who has played the tuba in ious military bands during his 16-year Army career, said: “The last time I performed in Aberdeen was with the brass band at Cults Academy, so I’m really excited to be back home as part of the Walking with Heroes tour.”LCpl Mair added: “I’m looking forward to having my local fan club – well, my mum, sister and aunties! – coming along to show us their support. It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

Other areas of strength include the University’s role in supporting the local and national economy through its energy-related teaching and research activities, recently demonstrated by the creation of a National Decommissioning Centre.The Guide has also taken into account Aberdeen’s activities in areas of importance including widening access, investment in facilities, student welfare, and internationalisation – the University opened its first overseas campus in Qatar last year.Professor George Boyne, Principal, said: “This is a major honour and a testament to the efforts of our staff and students, as well as the great sense of identity and community that we have at Aberdeen.“As an institution we consistently attract students with exceptional ability and potential, and this - along with the quality of our teaching - has been an important factor in our success in areas such as degree outcomes and graduate employability.                                                                                                         “In addition, our strength in research - exemplied by the Queens Anniversary Prize for our contribution to health services research - places us at the forefront of innovation in key areas of economic, environmental and societal importance.“This University was founded in 1495 with the purpose of being open to all and dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the service of others, and this continues to inspire our academic achievements.“Our focus on widening access and inclusivity, strength in interdisciplinary teaching and research, and international outlook are the modern-day interpretation of our founding principles, which have played a major role in Aberdeen being named Scottish University of the Year.“I’d like to congratulate everyone at the University who has worked so hard to help us achieve this honour.”                                                                                                        Alastair McCall, editor of The Sunday Times Good University Guide, said: \"Aberdeen\u0027s sharp rise up our league table this year is the biggest of any university in the top 30 and gives it a ranking commensurate to its status as one of the UK\u0027s leading academic institutions.\"It was a clear winner of our Scottish University of the Year award and earned a shortlisting for the UK University of the Year title off the back of improved performances in most of the metrics used in our tables.

He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Saturday 29 Sep 2018 6:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

My organisation, Walking to Save Dogs, raises funds to support carefully selected local shelters and projects that rescue dogs from these Festivals and the meat trade.\u0026ldquoThe ultimate goal is to put an end to the dog-meat trade through education that dogs are sentient beings, changing legislation, and providing dog-meat traders with alternative means to support their families.Robert aims to reach John O\u0026rsquoGroats by September 18, although he has already lost one of his canine companions.He added: \u0026ldquoSadly, Madeleine recently developed an eye problem so has gracefully pawed out.\u0026ldquoShe continues to support the rest of the pack from a comfy armchair at home.\u0026ldquoMy pets are the voice of millions of less fortunate dogs.\u0026ldquoThey have been well-prepared for this task and they love the outdoors.\u0026ldquoWe have been walking 12 miles a day on average and hope to finish our walk within a couple of weeks.\u0026ldquoI am touched beyond words at the kindness and generosity of the Scottish people I have met along the trail and look forward to meeting lots more on the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats.To follow Robert\u0026rsquos progress and to donate, go to: www.walkingtosavedogs or www.justgiving/crowdfunding/walkingtosavedogsSaturday 29 Sep 2018 6:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117727.jpg","title":"Grand Tour takes Paul to Altnabreac and Kildonan","story":"\u0026nbspTV presenter Paul Murton makes his way to Caithness and Sutherland in next week\u0027s edition of his current series, Grand Tours of Scotland\u0027s Lochs.During the course of the half-hour programme Paul heads to one of Britain\u0027s remotest railway stations, Altnabreac.

Westminster itself would see its total number of MPs cut from 650 to 600.One ramication includes the expansion of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat, which has Mr Stone of the Liberal Democrats as its sitting MP, to include a part of Lochaber.Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoThese changes would make our constituency a monster in terms of size.\u0026ldquoPeople have a right of access to their local MP but that representative can only do so much and only drive so many miles to serve the electorate.\u0026ldquoThe journey from Evanton in the south-east to John O\u0026rsquoGroats is 103 miles.

Ministers must now learn the lessons of the previous tendering process and make sure that they listen to local stakeholders and respond to the needs of our island communities.\u0026#8220This contract needs to drive service improvements and improved capacity on these leline routes. This needs to happen both in relation to freight and restoring the cuts to services on the Pentland Firth ushered in under the current contract.“It is imperative that the Pentland Firth and Aberdeen services continue to operate as one and are not ‘unbundled’. I also believe that we need to see Stromness and Scrabster as designated ports again under any future contract.”“Getting the detail right will require the minister and his officials to engage early and on an ongoing basis with the island councils, local businesses and other key stakeholders.

In the end, it was the kind auspices of the Harcus family that saw the OMS safely installed in Maitland Place last September.The early days of converting the former fishing shed to its current layout has taken lots of volunteer time and energy and will be ongoing for some time yet. In the meantime, the shed is set up with a tea/meeting room, a kitchen and facilities, and working space, and early projects have included the new shed at The Blue Door, outdoor musical equipment for Glaitness School and the livestock signs for the County Show park — amongst a myriad of others.As a self funded group in these dficult times we are grateful for those who have supported us: from the larger organisations including: Age Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture, Orkney Partnership Board Positive Ageing Delivery Group, Orkney Rotary Club, Orkney Seafarer’s Association and RVS Asda, through to each and every member of our 200 club, and everyone who has supported our fundraising events, including a very successful week in the Blue Door last week and at the local Shows.All are invited to attend the celebrations at The Shed at Maitland Place in Finstown, which will be open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 10am to 4pm.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor.

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a 6km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature \u0026ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said \u0026pound500,000 in total\u0026nbsp would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat \u0026ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotSaturday 29 Sep 2018 6:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgSaturday 29 Sep 2018 6:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would close  the new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed store\u0026rsquos grounds \u0026ndash another 6000 sq ft building and one covering 2500 sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for 79 cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the future  the site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: \u0026ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shop\u0026rsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move \u0026ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community council\u0026rsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new \u0026pound4million care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community council\u0026rsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: \u0026ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Street  allowed. The care home  has set a precedent so can\u0026rsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: \u0026ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care home\u0026rsquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar panels was incomplete and that some \u0026ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, \u0026ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: \u0026ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar panels.Mr Black offered an apology for the audit\u0026rsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: \u0026ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and it\u0026rsquos costing us a lot of money. That can\u0026rsquot be changed unless we\u0026rsquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to \u0026ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: \u0026ldquoThe council\u0026rsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. It\u0026rsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change. A commitment that \u0026lsquoit would not be allowed to happen for a fourth successive year\u0026rsquo is cold comfort. It should not have been allowed to get to this stage.\u0026ldquoPerhaps I shouldn\u0026rsquot be surprised.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

It is where direction is set, policy is \u0026#173formulated, and political leadership is given, based on the everyday lived experiences of people in workplaces, and communities right across the country.                It is the forum where ideas are exchanged and tested – and nowhere is that more the case than at conference fringe events, such as The World Transformed series, held in a brewery converted into a ­theatre space just a few miles from the main conference venue.            It is always a pleasure and a privilege to participate in this ­cauldron of ideas – and this week was no dferent. The fringe ­meeting was chaired by Ed Miliband and included economic thinkers ­Martin O’Neill and Grace Blakeley, and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy.             Some of the ideas were radical, like the call to revolutionise the UK banking system. Others were reconnecting with Labour’s socialistic traditions, like economic democracy and co-operative ownership, whilst yet others looked to a future built on automation, new science and reduced and shared working time. That these ideas were aired at the conference fringe was perhaps not exceptional, that they found a ready echo in platform speeches in the main conference hall was.It was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell who embraced much of this radical thinking, converting it into concrete policy proposals for an incoming Labour government. In his main address, he outlined plans to increase public ownership, including building a new frontier of worker ownership. He pledged to establish a Public and Community Ownership Unit in the Treasury. The unit will bring in external experts to advise on and implement the transfer of PFI schemes out of the private sector. That means public services will once again be owned by the public, because ­people have had enough of being ripped off by privatisation.His plans for the private sector also include action to clamp down on the industrial scale tax avoiders who are denying our hospitals, our schools and carers of the resources they need. Mobilising shareholder power to demand that companies uphold basic tax justice standards and ensuring that they meet the Fair Tax Mark standards is a central part of this approach.In a bid to rebalance power in the economy, he has outlined ­proposals to promote employee ownership in larger companies through share issues.This has some resemblance to the ideas designed by Hans Meidner in Sweden some years ago – an approach which I have championed for some time. In most European economies these ideas are mainstream – and it is a measure of how desperately our country needs real change that they are considered by some to be “left-field”.            In my main address to conference, I built on this radical thinking and applied it to Scotland, because it is clear we need Scottish solutions to Scottish problems and Scottish challenges. So, for instance, there is no Scottish Government ­industrial strategy. We need one with an enhanced role for workers and their unions in a more planned approach to the Scottish economy. Taking water back into public ownership is a pressing demand in England, but – thanks to a ­dramatic intervention by Labour in the then Strathclyde Regional Council, who famously ran a referendum to oppose water privatisation with a 71 per cent turn out and a 97 per cent rejection rate in the 1990s – we don’t need to take water into public ­ownership here. But that is not to say though that we may not need to reform the lines of its accountability and democratic oversight. One area where we ­definitely need change is on the long-standing question on the ­ownership of land. Fewer than 500 landowners own half of all private land in Scotland. To find more just land solutions means we will have to give some consideration to tax ­measures, ownership limits and residential qualications. We should certainly take the railways into public ownership, and look at the ownership and provision of bus and ferry services. With so much of our economy over dependent on overseas ownership and foreign direct investment – meaning it operates largely a branch plant – we need to look urgently at what we can do to rebalance economic ownership. One way is by taking the lead on measures like a statutory right for workers to own the company that they are employed in when it is put up for sale or facing closure. Such a boost to co-operative and employee ownership would ­relocalise ­control and lock in more local accountability.             Scotland is, after all, the birthplace of the first workers’ co-operative, in Fenwick, Ayrshire, and became the home of father of the co-operative movement, Robert Owen. Rebalancing the distribution of financial instruments like regional selective assistance to target investments by indigenous rather than overseas businesses is also the right thing to do. So the idea of a world transformed is therefore central to the mainstream thinking of the party. These policy proposals are not made in the abstract, but in the real-world context of Brexit, the May Government’s failing negotiations and the growing likelihood of a UK general election in the next few months. This week, John McDonnell said: “The greater the mess we inherit, the more radical we have to be the greater the need for change, the greater the opportunity we have to create that change, and we will.”As this week underlined, a Jeremy Corbyn-led government is up to that challenge and in Scotland the radical economic and social programme that the people need is finding new vitality and relevance.         \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806919.1538144394!/image/image.jpg","title":"kezia dugdale labour s decision to stop funding wings over scotland case political","story":"        Kezia Dugdale says she has questioned how anyone can trust the Labour Party after it decided to stop funding her defence in a defamation case.

The accusation was made as  Aberdeenshire Council became the first local authority in Scotland to vote for a so-called People’s Vote.            A majority of SNP councillors banded together with some Liberal Democrat, Green, independent and Labour members to defeat the ruling Tory administration on the issue.            The council voted by 33 to 26 in favour of a motion by Green councillor Martin Ford to back another referendum, which in this case would include a Remain option.SNP councillors to back the referendum motion included members for coastal wards including Fraserburgh , Troup , Banff  and Peterhead .Their support for the referendum puts them at odds with the official SNP view on the issue. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she will not stand in the way of a People’s Vote, but has not backed the campaign,Two years ago there was a strong Brexit vote in Scotland’s fishing communities where EU withdrawal was seen as a means to exiting the much-criticised EU common fisheries policy. Scottish Conservative MP for Banff and Buchan, David Duguid, said: “I am astonished that SNP members representing fishing communities in the north-east would seek to revisit the 2016 referendum.            “The British people – including those here in Banff and Buchan – voted to leave the EU. People voted to leave for a number of dferent reasons. But in coastal communities like those across Banff and Buchan, many people just wanted out of the common fisheries policy.“Failure to respect the outcome of the vote would be an utter betrayal of our fishermen and a travesty for democracy in this country. The UK Government is delivering on the will of the British people and we are at a critical stage in negotiations. The question for Nicola Sturgeon is – does she agree with her SNP councillors in Aberdeenshire and is she also willing to disregard the views of our fishermen?”SNP councillor Richard Thomson said: “The SNP moved an amendment recognising the severe damage that Brexit will have upon Aberdeenshire – something which the Tories seem to be recklessly ignoring. That damage will be acutely felt by key north-east industries such as our food and drink, and oil and gas sectors. We’ll leave the Tories to act as cheerleaders for Theresa May’s botched negotiations.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793856.1538165899!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp activists step up independence drive on national action day","story":"        SNP depute leader Keith Brown will today move the party on to a \u0026#8220campaign footing\u0026#8221 as activists attempt to reach 50,000 people across Scotland to promote independence.

Mr Brown said his party was building a fresh case for independence, but his opponents claimed the SNP was “stoking up ision”.            “We are excited about the conversations that we are going to be having with people up and down the country today,” the SNP leader said.\u2028“I’m keen to understand better how the people of Scotland view the UK leaving the EU within the context of ‘no deal’, and what impact these outcomes have on the voters’ feelings towards the opportunities of an independent Scotland.\u2028“The Tories are deeply ided and on the brink of implosion over Brexit. And Labour still, incredibly, don’t know what they are doing. Meanwhile our party and the independence movement have our sights on a far more positive future for Scotland as an independent country.            “The polls show a majority would vote for Scottish independence after the UK leaves the European Union. And the number of people who view independence as a positive for Scotland’s economy now outnumber those who think otherwise.”Mr Brown added: “This day of action moves the SNP onto a campaign footing. We are building a fresh case for independence and we are also campaign-ready for any possible snap general election.”\u2028The SNP’s national day of action will take place as Labour activists take their party’s plans to rebuild communities to the streets. Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw criticised the SNP’s latest bid to put Scottish independence at the forefront of the political agenda.Mr Carlaw said: “All this day of action is going to achieve is to remind people the SNP is a single-issue party and that issue has already been put to bed.“After more than a decade of a nationalist government talking of nothing other than breaking up Britain, people are fed up.“They want to see the Scottish Government focusing on what matters, not touring the country rabble-rousing and stoking up ision.”            Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “Our NHS is creaking under the strain, education standards are falling and our economy is flat-lining yet SNP politicians are spending their Saturdays iding our communities.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806731.1538130515!/image/image.jpg","title":"port of cromarty on crest of a wave","story":"        The Port of Cromarty Firth has recorded its best ever year after turnover jumped by \u0026#1631 million, helping to fuel further investment.                Annual turnover rose to £9.9m – the highest in the port’s 40-year history, new figures have revealed.            Bosses said the strong financial position would enable the business to continue to invest in major developments, such as the new quayside and laydown space, which is in the planning stages to be built through the next couple of years.            The past year was described as an “extremely busy one” for the port, which saw it ersy from its core business of oil and gas to renewables, decommissioning and cruise.Chief executive Bob Buskie said: “At the start of 2016, with low oil and gas prices, we knew the port had to adapt to sustain our growth and help keep local people in work.“Firstly, supporting our core customers in oil and gas was a key concern. After the necessary consultation, we introduced a new pricing for statutory dues in January 2017, which meant an average 5 per cent reduction in fees for most clients, supporting them through the downturn.  “Secondly, the port had to look to the future and see what we could do to help sustain jobs and growth. This is where our ersication strategy came in, with 2017 seeing us undertake a project to introduce decommissioning to the port in an open port policy, where our supply chain could bid for work under our licences.”Cruise continued to be a success story in 2017, with the port being named as the busiest in Scotland. In another record-breaking year, the facility welcomed 93 ships and more than 150,000 passengers to the Highlands. This represented a 54 per cent increase on 2016.            The direct spend from these passengers was worth more than £15m to the local economy and provided a boost to a range of attractions.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806879.1538141793!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotrail were not consulted over hampden semi finals decision","story":"        The SPFL\u0026#8217s decision to schedule both Betfred Cup semi-finals at Hampden on the same day will present a \u0026#8220signicant logistical challenge\u0026#8221, ScotRail have admitted.

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

He could not understand why locals should not be able to access the pool facilities at this time.\nHe said: \"I work with sustainable tourism myself.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in 2018, having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.\nAfter a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on 29 minutes, and never looked back.\nEvan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from 20 yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parry  from Gairloch, Ian MacLeod  from Inverness, and 75-year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a Lucky2Bhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.\nOn Saturday 9th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week.

partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards

the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a

Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who

changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew

have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €60. \nLike Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. \nIf the film ‘Black 47’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview \n Ruairí Doyle\n\n“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TD\nSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. \nHe also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. \nSpeaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.\nThe Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the 1980’s. \nThis informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, even  it were 40 or 50 years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.\nPearse, who has been a TD since 2010, talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. \nThe Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. \nHe said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,  I am in thatposition.”\nSinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.\nPearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. \nThis is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”\nHe continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €2.5 billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”\nAs Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.\nDeputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  \n“What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  \n“It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”\nTouching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the 26 Counties.\nPearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. \nHe continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  \n“And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”\nSinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. \nThis Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. \nTeachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athome  that’s what they wish.” \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"happiest places in northern ireland revealed and the most miserable","story":"                \nScores were produced for council area by the Office of National Statistics  based on four measures of personal well-being - le satisfaction, feeling that the things done in le are worthwhile, happiness and anxiety.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHealth, employment and relationship status are key determinants of personal well-being according to previous research done by the ONS.

McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio\u0027s 10th anniversary are  Millie Moore , Dr Riann Coulter  and Roger Wilson .\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“McWilliam’s work remains the key attraction within our artistic programme and we complement our outstanding collection of his work with at least four major modern and contemporary exhibitions every year.”\n\nOver a decade, the gallery has hosted hugely popular exhibitions from some of Europe’s most celebrated artists including William Scott, Basil Blackshaw, Rita Duffy, Margaret Clarke, Susan MacWilliam and, recently, Neil Shawcross. Local groups including Banbridge Camera Club, Banbridge Art Club and local schools and colleges have also had the opportunity to exhibit at the gallery, ensuring its popularity with local visitors and supporters.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere also big plans ahead, with a major exhibition of Scottish art from the Fleming Wyfold Collection scheduled for summer 2019. An exciting collaboration with the British Museum is already under way too, in addition to plans for a unique exhibition of award-winning works from the internationally celebrated local contemporary painter Colin Davidson.\n\nLord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Cllr Julie Flaherty, said: “With a stunning sculpture garden and an authentic recreation of McWilliam’s studio, we’re delighted and proud to celebrate a decade of work, commitment and success and look forward to the many more great things ahead. We’d like to thank everyone for their patronage and loyalty to the gallery and look forward to seeing faces old and new in this celebratory year.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nPresent and past serving staff at the F.E. McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio at the 10th anniversary celebrations.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nOne of the gallery’s closest collaborations has been with its cross-border partner, Highlanes Gallery, Drogheda. Jointly funded through East Border Region Interreg funding, the two galleries have both become established as leading visual arts venues and are currently working on a new, joint exhibition for November 2018 which features work by top international artists from the Arts Council Collection, London and National Museums Northern Ireland.\n\nF.E. McWilliam Gallery and Studio also incorporates an award-winning restaurant – Quails Café – which adds huge weight to its appeal as a major cultural and hospitality destination which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTo celebrate its 10th year, the F.E. McWilliam Studio and Gallery is presenting two very special exhibitions, both of which run until November 10.\n\nLucienne Day: Living Design Celebrating the le and work of one of most influential designers of the post-war generation, Lucienne Day, and tells the story of her thrilling design career, unfolding in a sequence of photographs drawn from the archives of the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation. Curated by Professor Emma Hunt, Arts University Bournemouth and Day’s daughter Paula Day, the critically-acclaimed exhibition has attracted thousands of visitors from across the UK, featuring in Elle Decoration and the  Magazine.\n\nOpen 18 Sculpture: Showcasing the stunning 30 outdoor sculptural works by acclaimed contemporary artists including Sandra Bell, Orla de Bri, Paddy Campbell, Drydan Wilson, Helen Hanse and Anthony Scott.

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n

The UK average was 7.7.\n\nOverall Northern Ireland continued to report the highest average le satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness ratings, and the lowest anxiety ratings, when compared with the UK and the other constituent countries of the UK.\n\nCommenting on the figures, Silvia Manclossi, head of the ONS Quality of Le Team, said: \"An important part of our work is looking beyond the economic health of the country to how its people are faring and inequalities in society.\n\n\"Today, for the first time, we have identied how factors such as health, access to services, and crime levels may affect how people rate their well-being in dferent parts of the UK.

At a crucial juncture in the Brexit negotiations it is hugely important that we sustain and build further links, cooperation and engagement across all of Ireland. I have no doubt the Seanad will be keen to hear what the Mayor has to say and continue to play our part in supporting the work of councillors across the country.\n\n“The memorandum between Belfast and Dublin city councils can act as a positive catalyst for cross-border relations and delivery. Given the role of the Seanad in relation to local government it is vital we engage with councils across Ireland who are very often at the coal face of political and community le.”\n\nSeanadóir Ó Donnghaile continued: “I am delighted too that the Seanad will also hear from the Mayors of Dublin and Cork in the coming months off the back of this initiative \u0026#8211 we should build on that engagement and facilitate more.\n\n“Ard Mhéara Hargey is a proven community, political and civic leader, I look forward to welcoming her and hearing her message to the Seanad on behalf of the people of Belfast at what is a deeply uncertain period for our all-Ireland economy, our peace process and the rights, wellbeing and prosperity of all our people.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"threes a shroud resurrection a triumph","story":"\n\nIT’S\n back on stage and it is better than ever before. Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"\nTHE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted 6000 responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.\n\nMr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation. The campaign also took the opportunity to highlight their campaign objectives: raising awareness of the Time for Truth advice clinics across Belfast on Saturday, September 29 and working to see  institutions for dealing with the past up and running.\n\nCampaign spokesman Ciarán MacAirt said: “We were very grateful for the time that the Deputy Director of the NIO took to listen to the families of the Time for Truth campaign. After handing over 6000 responses to the legacy consultation, we discussed how we supported the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in full and the proper resourcing of the coronial inquest system and Office of Police Ombudsman.”\n\n“We also told Mr Flatt that we planned to gather even more responses before the close of the consultation on 5th of October, especially during the advice clinics we are running across Belfast on Saturday to support any citizens who wish to respond.\n\n“We were also keen to discuss how long after the consultation closes that our families will see the British state’s response to the consultation, its passing of appropriate legislation at Westminster, and the structures in place and working. Although we want to ensure that the work is done properly, unlike it was in the past, families have longer to wait for any prospect of truth and justice under the proposed mechanisms, so the proper resourcing of the legacy inquests and the Office of the Police Ombudsman could help begin the process now. Any other delay will see the families of the Time for Truth campaign take to the streets as we did in February of this year when 7000 victims and survivors, friends and supporters joined our March for Truth.” \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36596884.ece/e32d5/AUTOCROP/w140square/ks%20at%20Stormont%2002.jpg","title":"free belfast telegraph transfer test answer booklets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit 60 back special status for northern ireland in poll of 4000 online belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Primark Belfast - August 29th 2018 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, a meeting took place between business groups Belfast Chamber of Commerce, Hospitality Ulster, and Retail NI, as well as the head of the Civil Service David Sterling, permanent secretaries from the dferent Government departments, and representatives from Belfast City Council. \n\nIn a joint statement following the meeting, the business groups announced the focus would be on reducing the size of the cordon before the end of October. \n\nDecision-making power on how to deal with the recovery effort lies with Primark, and the retail giant is expected to make an announcement next week. \n\nIn a joint statement, Rajesh Rana, President of Belfast Chamber, Glyn Roberts, CEO of Retail NI and Colin Neill, CEO of Hospitality Ulster said: “We welcome the investment Primark, Belfast City Council and Department for Communities have made in the City Recovery Fund and the work that BCC has done to date.\n\n“However, the priority now is to get the cordon reduced to allow pedestrian flow to resume across all the affected streets.\n\n“We, and our members of whom make up the majority of businesses in the retail core and beyond, are extremely frustrated that there is still no firm plan for doing this.\"\n\nThe business groups called for action to be taken as soon as possible to reduce the cordon, saying any delay beyond the end of October would \"seriously detrimental to the long-term viability of many businesses in city centre as this would seriously impact on the Christmas trading season\".\n\nEfforts have been made to reduce the impact on businesses of the reduced trading area, with those unable to open having their rates liability reduced to zero, and funding commitments of £1.25m from Belfast City Council and £500,000 from Primark to help the businesses affected - with this money going into the Council-managed City Recovery Fund. \n\nRegardless, those inside or near the cordon are continuing to face an uncertain financial future, with revenue in shops able to open near the cordon down as much as 85%.\n\n\n\n\nBusinesses behind Primark fire cordon in Belfast will pay no rates\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth after Belfast Primark blaze, no-go zone traders fear for survival\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the Belfast  earlier this week, Michelle Chichirim - owner of Phone Boutique on the edge of the safety cordon around the gutted Primark store - said she was \"shocked and angry at how bad business is\". \n"},{"url":null,"title":"dups ian paisley asked council to pay for 1500 table at dinner council chief embarrassed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

At the museum it took six days, a team of 10 people working eight hours a day, to reconstruct him.\"\n\nBut she stressed it was all worth it to see the look of amazement on children\u0027s faces.\n\n\"It\u0027s so exciting for them. We had some children in earlier this week to see Dippy and they had a great time,\" she added.\n\nThere were audible \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" from excited primary four and five pupils from Botanic Primary School, who got to experience a sneak preview of Dippy yesterday.\n\nEight-year-old Christopher Killen said it was the second time he was seeing Dippy, but he loved the fact it was now in Belfast.\n\n\"When I was in London when I was three I got to see him then, but it was just as exciting to see him today,\" he said.\n\nClassmate Nadia  said she had been impressed by the sheer size of the mighty prehistoric beast.\n\n\"He\u0027s the biggest dinosaur that I\u0027ve ever seen. He\u0027s gigantic,\" she added.\n\nOn hand to explain what Dippy was like when he roamed the Earth around 150 million years ago was palaeontologist Dr Susannah Maidment.\n\n\"Dippy was a plant eater and would not have been a fast runner,\" she said.\n\n\"He would have been slow and rumbling along.\"\n\nUrging people to come along and see the exhibit, Dr Maidment said that when Dippy was alive all those millenia ago he would have weighed the equivalent of 10 cars.\n\n\"I think he\u0027s amazing,\" she added.\n\n\"I remember seeing him as a child, and Dippy\u0027s a great way to get children interested in natural sciences.\"\n\nDippy the dino in numbers\n\n26m in  The equivalent to two double-decker buses\n\n292 bones make up the dinosaur replica\n\n150m years ago he roamed the Earth\n\n4m in height\n\n10 The number of cars he would have weighed\n\n50cms in  and 25cm wide His skull is tiny in comparison to his body\n\n1905 The year he first went on display in London\n\n200,000 pre-bookings received by the Ulster Museum\n\n120,000 visitors are expected to view Dippy in Belfast\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 250 northern ireland people aged over 100 and 37000 aged","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon. He was not able to tell them how he was going to get the man on the moon.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister backs bid to bring world cup to uk and ireland in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Alex McLeish is building an exciting young Scottish side.\n\n“Wales are going from strength-to-strength under my old mate Giggsy .\n\n“And who can forget Gareth Southgate and England’s unbelievable performance this summer in Russia?\n\n“I made my Premier League debut in 1996, the last time there was a major football tournament on these shores, and the excitement across the country was something else.  So I really welcome the support the Government is offering.”\n\nLondon and Glasgow will host eleven games in the UEFA European Championships in 2020 with Wembley hosting the semi-finals and the final.\n\nIn the last six years the UK has successfully hosted the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the 2014 Tour De France Grand Depart and the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\nAny England bid would face opposition from the joint campaign of Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay which could be buoyed by the fact 2030 marks 100 years since the first World Cup, held in Uruguay in 1930.\n\nIt is also possible there will be an African bid, especially in light of Morocco’s defeat to the USA for the 2026 tournament.\n\nLabour also welcomed the announcement, with shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary Tom Watson pointing out it had also backed the plan in July.\n\nThe deputy party leader added: “I’m delighted that the Prime Minister has followed Labour’s lead and is willing to back a bid.\n\n“This summer’s World Cup and the performance of England inspired the nation.\n\n“In 2030, it’s time for football to come home.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"senior dup official denies delaying costcontrol on botched energy scheme","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The RHI scheme was aimed at encouraging the use of green energy.\n\nThe RHI inquiry is also looking into allegations that some DUP special advisers attempted to delay the introduction of cost control measures in 2015.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr Johnston was described as the “second most powerful person in the DUP” behind the leader of the party.\n\nIt came after he was accused of sending a “blunt and not respectful” email to former DETI minister Jonathan Bell, which the inquiry’s junior counsel Donal Lunny said suggests he is above Mr Bell in the rank structure.\n\nEvidence was put to Mr Johnston to reflect his seniority within the party including an email exchange with former Stormont Executive press officer David Gordon, in which Mr Gordon suggests to make a “scary TJ call to  Nolan” over queries from his BBC radio programme about RHI.\n\nMr Johnston said he has worked within the DUP structure for a long time and with that came a “greater sense of knowledge”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wait wait he screamed ryanair passenger tackled to ground making late dash across tarmac at dublin airport","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

this year to accommodate the greater quantities of stocks being landed on the quayside at Peterhead, the UK’s largest white fish and pelagic port.\n\nIt replaces the former market at Merchants Quay and is part of Peterhead Port Authority’s £51 million project to redevelop the harbour.\n\nIn the first nine weeks of its operation, more than 250,000 boxes of fish were sold in the new fish market, rising to just short of 340,000 boxes in the first 11 weeks.\n\nThe new market has a capacity of 10,000 boxes and the latest refrigeration technology which, combined with good access for boats on the quayside and articulated lorries on the shoreside, ensures that product quality is maintained as fish pass through.\n\nIt also new has office space and a cafe.\n\nCharles, who is known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland, will attend the opening ceremony on Saturday along with more than 500 invited guests.\n\nThere will be entertainment from local school pupils, Turrf Pipe Band and musicians Fiona Kennedy and Maggie Adamson.\n\nThe prince will also view exhibition stands and meet contractors who worked on the project, fisheries organisations and heritage groups.\n\nHe will also tour fishing vessels moored at the quay.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"facebook security breach all you need to know","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Here is everything you need to know about the cyber attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\n\nIn a post on the social network’s news site, Facebook vice president of product management Guy Rosen said a security breach affecting 50 million users had been discovered on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the investigation is in its early stages, the firm said the hackers had exploited a vulnerability in Facebook’s code involving the “View As” feature, which lets people see what their own profile looks like to someone else.\n\nIn a later post, Facebook said the vulnerability had arisen from a combination of three distinct bugs, which meant the hackers were able extract other users’ access tokens – the equivalent of digital keys that keep people logged in to the Facebook app.\n\nIt explained that when using the “View As” feature, the code had not removed the box that allows people to wish friends a happy birthday and incorrectly provided the opportunity to post a video.\n\nIn turn, the video uploader incorrectly generated an access tag that had the permissions of the Facebook mobile app. The third bug meant that the access token generated was for the user being looked up, instead of the person doing the viewing.\n\nPedro Canahuati, vice president of engineering, security and privacy, said: “The attackers were then able to pivot from that access token to other accounts, performing the same actions and obtaining further access tokens.”\n\n\nWho was affected?\n\n\nFacebook has not revealed whether any UK users were hit, or where the hacked accounts were based, only saying that it had affected almost 50 million of its more than two billion users.\n\nMr Rosen said the attack could have given the hackers access to other apps  a user had logged into them using their Facebook name and password – and said the firm was investigating whether there was any access to Instagram accounts. He confirmed, however, that WhatsApp was not impacted by the breach.\n\n\nWhat has Facebook done?\n\n\nFacebook says it has already fixed the vulnerability and has informed law enforcement of the attack.\n\nIt has reset the access tokens of the hacked accounts, as well as another 40 million accounts that have been subject to a “View As” look-up in the last year. \n\nAs a result, around 90 million people were having to log back in to Facebook, or any of their apps that use Facebook Login.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSome users may see a warning message when logging back into Facebook \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I do to protect my account?\n\n\nFollowing the announcement of the breach, Facebook issued guidance on the next steps to take.\n\nWhile some accounts have been automatically logged out, no one needs to change their passwords, the firm said.\n\nThose who were not logged out automatically, but want to log out as a precaution, should visit the “Security and Login” section which lists all the places a user is logged in to Facebook.\n\nPeople can use the one-click option to log out of Facebook on all PCs and devices it may have been accessed it on.\n\nAnyone who has dficulty logging back in should visit Facebook’s help centre.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say september","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

And while it looks rather unsurprising, it also goes some way to indicating how the algorithm works.\n\n\nLionel Messi\n – 94, striker, Barcelona\n\nNeymar\n – 92, left wing, PSG\n\nMohamed Salah\n – 88, right wing, Liverpool\n\nKevin De Bruyne\n – 91, attacking midfielder, Manchester City\n\nLuka Modric\n – 91, central midfielder, Real Madrid\n\nN’Golo Kante\n – 89, central defensive midfielder, Chelsea\n\nJordi Alba\n – 87, left back, Barcelona\n\nKyle Walker\n – 84, right back, Manchester City\n\nSergio Ramos\n – 91, centre back, Real Madrid\n\nDiego Godin\n – 90, centre back, Atletico Madrid\n\nDavid De Gea\n – 91, goalkeeper, Manchester United\n\nThere are a number of right-backs with an overall rating of 84 for example in Fa 19, but Kyle Walker is the pick of the bunch based on the algorithm.\n\nIt is also notable that Cristiano Ronaldo, the highest rated player in Fa, is missing from this first group, but Messi scores higher on our algorithm in the key attributes for strikers – where both players are positioned.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nMessi is the best striker in the game, according to the algorithm \n\n\n\n\nTeam chemistry is not taken into account – instead, each XI represents a pool of the best players for each position within each price bracket, based on the algorithm.\n\nThe next batch of players occupy the mid-price range, with a buy-it-now price of less than 50k Fa Coins on launch night.\n\n\nRodrigo\n – 84, striker, Valencia\n\nKingsley Coman\n – 83, left wing, Bayern Munich\n\nRiyad Mahrez\n – 85, right wing, Manchester City\n\nNabil Fekir\n – 85, attacking midfielder, Lyon\n\nMarek Hamsik\n – 87, central midfielder, Napoli\n\nArturo Vidal\n – 85, central defensive midfielder, Barcelona\n\nAlex Telles\n – 84, left back, Porto\n\nAntonio Valencia\n – 82, right back, Manchester United\n\nKostas Manolas\n – 85, centre back, Roma\n\nMedhi Benatia\n – 86, centre back, Juventus\n\nEderson\n – 86, goalkeeper, Manchester City\n\nThis batch of players recommends the best options for when you’ve got a bit of money to spend but not enough to go for the obvious choices – with each player highly regarded by frequent players of the game. \n\nIf you can afford a Riyad Mahrez or Nabil Fekir you can then build a team with good chemistry around them by picking players from the same country, league or even team to play alongside them. \n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nLyon’s Nabil Fekir is an excellent option in midfield \n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most invaluable tip offs of all are the budget batch however, made up of players worth less than 5k Fa Coins on launch night.\n\n\nCedric Bakambu\n – 82, striker, Beijing Guoan\n\nGoncalo Guedes\n – 82, left wing, Valencia\n\nEdin Visca\n – 82, right wing, Basaksehir\n\nHakim Ziyech\n – 82, attacking midfielder, Ajax\n\nKevin Strootman\n – 82, central midfielder, Marseille\n\nIdrissa Gueye\n – 82, central defensive midfielder, Everton\n\nAlex Grimaldo\n – 81, left back, Benfica\n\nAlo Odriozola\n – right back, 80, Real Madrid\n\nJose Gimenez\n – 84, centre back, Atletico Madrid\n\nClement Lenglet\n – 82, centre back, Barcelona\n\nTimo Horn\n – 83, goalkeeper, FC Koln\n\nWith Fa 19 just released it is this collection of players that is perhaps the most important: a collection of names you might not recognise, but that could act as a starting point when funds are low. \n\nNames such as Goncalo Guedes and Clement Lenglet stand out should you want to build a La Liga-themed team, or  you wanted to stick to the Premier League why not start with Idrissa Gueye of Everton?\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nIs Senegalese Gueye a good place to start in central defensive midfield? \n\n\n\n\nWhatever your budget, there are bargains and savvy buys to be made – happy team building.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derrys council provide free female sanitary products buildings part campaign address period poverty","story":"\nSinn Féin Councillor Sandra Duffy has welcomed the decision by Derry City and Strabane District Council to back her motion which called on the Council to become the first in the North to support the “On the Ball” campaign.\n\nThe aim of the campaign is to provide free sanitary products in as many sporting grounds and public buildings as possible to combat the ever growing issue of period poverty.\n\nAnd as an initial step that the council looks at the feasibility and implementation of providing free sanitary products in Council facilities in keeping with the “On The Ball” campaign.\n\nSpeaking after the announcement tonight Councillor Duffy said “It’s great news that the council have backed my motion and has now become the first council in the North to embrace the “On the Ball” campaign to help prevent Period Poverty.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“I hope that more councils adopt my motion and support the growing efforts to eradicate Period Poverty and highlight the issue at every opportunity.\n\n“Since I embarked on highlighting the “On the Ball” campaign locally it’s amazing to see just how quickly things have moved and how much support I have received.

hours ambulance collapsing derry cinema","story":"\nConcerns have been raised over ambulance cover in the city after a woman who collapsed at a Derry cinema was forced to wait two hours for an ambulance to arrive.\n\nThe incident happened at the Brunswick Moviebowl in the Pennyburn Industrial Estate on Saturday, September 21.\n\nEamonn McLaughlin, Manager of the cinema at Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn, said that an ambulance took a full two hours after a female customer became ill and collapsed before 4pm. \n\nIt was almost 6pm before an ambulance arrived.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News, said that when they contacted the emergency services, the operator said they were ‘inundated’.\n\nIt was brought to our attention that a customer was feeling unwell.\n\n“We always have quite a few first aiders on site so the lady was assessed and we decided we needed to ring for an ambulance while the customer was left in a comfortable position with a blanket and pillow.\n“The ambulance was first called at 3.45pm and didn’t arrive until 5.45pm. \n\n“We rang again at about 4.20pm and we were told that they were inundated with calls and they couldn’t tell us how much longer it would take, but that  there were any further concerns to ring back.\n\n“At about 5pm we were quite concerned because she was getting very weak and we wanted to know  we should try to have her gently lted into a car to get her to hospital.”\n\nMr McLaughlin said that after contacting the operator again, they were told that the ambulance was coming from Strabane.\n\n“We wanted to know what the best thing to do was so we rang again at about 5pm and were told that an ambulance was on its way but that it was making its way from Strabane so was still quite a way off,” he added.\n\n“I had discussed it with the telephone operator and with the family and we decided to make the customer comfortable as we didn’t want to move her.”\n\nMr McLaughlin said that he understood that the serious delay was down to the fact the ambulance service was ‘inundated’ with calls and didn’t have the resources to cope.\n\nHowever, he said he was happy that the woman was recovering well and that it had not been more serious.\n“Thankfully, she is doing well,” he said.\n\n“But  it had been more serious, it could have been a very dferent story.”\n\n\nDeteriorating position \n\n\nA spokesperson Northern Ireland Ambulance Service  confirmed that they received a call at 3.46pm last Saturday and, based on the information given, ‘the call was determined to be Category C, neither serious, nor immediately le-threatening’.\n\nThe spokesperson said that the call was referred to the Clinical Support Desk  Paramedic based in the Emergency Control Room, which ed a call at around 4.15pm to establish further details and advice was given  the patient’s condition deteriorated to call 999 again.\n\n“An ambulance had already been despatched by 5.04pm when a further 999 call was made at 5.16pm relating the deterioration of the patient’s condition and the call was upgraded to Category A, potentially serious or le-threatening,” the spokesperson added.\n\n“The ambulance then arrived at the scene at 5.44pm and the patient was assessed, treated and discharged at the scene.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot =

in demand\n\n\nThe NIAS spokesperson apologised for the wait and said that, in the last five years, there has been an increase in demand for ambulances with calls going up by almost 50 per cent.\n\n“NIAS would like to apologise for any discomfort and distress caused to the patient during her wait for the arrival of an ambulance,” the spokesperson added.\n\n“There has been an increase in ambulance response times over recent years and the main reason for this is the year on year increase in demand for our service.”\n\n“The number of calls to the Ambulance Service has increased from 150,093 in 2012/13, to 220,090 in 2017/18, an increase of 46 per cent.”\n\nThe NIAS spokesperson said that there has been a system in place to respond to the most serious cases first and urged the public to engage in a public consultation on the new model, was launched on Thursday.\n\n“In order to address this deteriorating position, NIAS has undertaken a detailed demand and capacity analysis which has established the level of additional capacity required to meet demand within the target timescales, and is developing proposals for a new clinical response model to provide the most urgent response to the most clinically urgent patients,” she said.\n\n“This proposed new model is based on similar models introduced elsewhere in the UK which have proved effective and indicate improved patient outcomes. \n\n“A public consultation on this proposed new model will be launched today and will be available on our website \nwww.nias.hscni.net\n. \n\n“NIAS would encourage all stakeholders to engage during the consultation process.”\n\n\nHeroes\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Foyle MLA and SDLP Health spokesperson Mark H Durkan, said that he had spoken to the Chair of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service with regard to shortages in the emergency service.\n\n“I recently met with the newly appointed Chair of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, Nicole Lappin, to highlight my concerns about the shortage and lack of cover in the North West area, which she accepted the merit of,” he said.\n\n“She outlined her desire to transform the service and make it fit for purpose. \n\n“The problems aren’t to do with the state of the fleet it is actually the shortage of human resources available.” \n\nHe added: “There are just not enough people in the job and I do not think the people doing the job have adequate support.\n\n“In fact, it is usually people who work on ambulances who share their concerns with me about the state of affairs that prevents them from doing their job and getting to people on time.\n\n“This is no reflection on the staff, they are absolute heroes but at times they are covering distances from Limavady to Omagh, leaving only one ambulance in this area.”\n\n\nPictured above: Brunswick Moviebowl where a woman who collapsed last Saturday had to wait two hours for an ambulance to arrive. \n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures colourful day out

In Downpatrick, 335 are on the waiting list, with 227 in urgent need.\n\nLast year, a total of 95 social homes were allocated in both towns, with the Executive confirming work is currently underway to build 30 new homes in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick as part of the first phase of the redevelopment of the former Downe Hospital site.\n\nThe waiting list figures were outlined at Monday night\u0026rsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with politicians saying they are acutely aware of the pressure on housing officials to meet increasing need.\n\nThey say they are willing to do all they can to help and hope land can be secured to build more social homes to help reduce waiting list numbers.

Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has labelled the behaviour of Lord Melchett as \u0026ldquodisgraceful and called for immediate action.\n\nThe furore centres around a five year-old girl whose father wants her to attend a state controlled school in Dundrum or Castlewellan. However, because she lives in the country outside Castlewellan she would need to have school minibus transport provided for her.\n\nAccording to Mrs Smyth, she has been told by the South Eastern Education and Library Board that the child will have to go to a maintained school in Annsborough which would exclude the need for transport arrangements.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe child\u0026rsquos father wants her to go to a controlled school and he is entitled to have her do so, Mrs Smyth said. \u0026ldquoI am thoroughly disgusted and I think that the Department of Education must be totally inefficient  they don\u0026rsquot answer within a month.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash There just seems to be no stopping the Downpatrick supergroup Rosetta Stone, who recently completed another dynamic tour of Japan and will be setting off on a trip to Thailand later this year.\n\nThe five members of the group \u0026mdash Damien, Terry and Colin McKee, Andy LeGear and Ian Mitchell \u0026mdash are just back from their second conquering trip to Japan where their latest hit, Sheila, is currently number one.\n\nIn the last year the band have been playing constantly across the globe and have built up a huge following in many countries, including Germany and Canada. But it has been in Japan that Rosetta Stone have really shot to stardom.\n\nThis was one of the first countries which the band visited after its formation and it became clear from the start that the young Irish lads obviously had something which appealed to Japanese girls.\n\nAt the end of their first Japanese tour each member of the group received a gold disc for mass sales of their LP, Rock Pictures, and their first two singles also thundering into the Japanese charts.\n\nNow they have gone and taken Japan by storm again where they are playing to crowds of between 11,000 and 15,000 twice a day.\n\nKILCLIEF \u0026mdash Strangford police have appealed to the public to help them trace keys which were stolen from a car on Saturday.\n\nThe car, a Chrysler Hillman Minx, had been parked in a field at Kilclief between 1.30 and 2pm while\u0026nbsp Mr John McMullan, of Drumroe Road, was working. When he arrived back at the vehicle an ignition key and a boot key had ben taken.\n\nPolice in Strangford have since been informed that a children\u0026rsquos sponsored walk was passing through the area at the time and they have appealed to parents to ask the children who took part  they know anything about the theft.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash A burning interest in art has led Newcastle couple Margaret and Gerry Grant into an unusual project \u0026mdash the opening of a new art gallery in their own home.\n\nWith over 200 paintings and sculptures of their own they have opened the gallery in an extension to their Bryansford Road house.\n\nBut it isn\u0026rsquot only for the fun of it. The Grants will be buying and selling works and promoting exhibitions. Already they have lined up an autumn show with exhibits from a Spanish painter and an Italian sculptor.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are aiming at the professional rather than the amateur, Mrs Grant said. \u0026ldquoOur main aim is to share our interest in art, but we do see the commercial and promotional sides to it.\n\n\u0026ldquoReally there is a wide range of work on show. My husband and I have been interested in art for a long time.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash A phantom clothes line thief has struck again \u0026mdash this time in Dundrum. The thief, who has been confining his acts to the Newcastle and Dundrum area, struck during the night at a house on the Dromara Road.\n\nA considerable number of children\u0026rsquos clothes were taken from the line, making it a profitable night for the thief.\n\nPolice in Dundrum and Newcastle are anxious to catch the thief, who must have a considerable wardrobe stocked up by now. Anyone with information or who sees anyone acting suspiciously around houses at night should contact them immediately.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash Plans for a new primary school in Killinchy have brought a \u0026rsquono go\u0026rsquo sign from local residents. In a petition to the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the residents of Ardview Park have expressed serious concern about the plans.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos not the building of the school they object to, but rather the fact that access to the site will be off Ardview Park. They say they are concerned about traffic which will be using the road, both during the construction of the school and when it is opened.\n\nTheir petition was recently shown to members of the Board\u0026rsquos Finance Committee. Afterwards it was agreed to set up a special sub-committee to visit the school and report back on the plans.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash A Ballygowan housewe will be one of eight ladies who will be taking part in the national finals of the Cook of the Realm contest.

The top prize is valued at more than \u0026pound4,000.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Ardglass boxer Ray Ross has been offered a wonderful chance to make an impact on the British lightweight scene.\n\nEvery since he lost a close decision to Charlie Nash for the Irish title two years ago, the 28 year-old slugger has shown indferent form. But now the Ardglass golf course greenskeeper has a chance to make the top before he runs out of fight time and interest.\n\nRoss has been matched with the experienced Jonnie Elliott, of Bournemouth, over eight rounds at Maysfield Leisure Centre in Belfast on October 11 and a win would hoist Ross up the lightweight ladder and on to bigger punch for paydays.\n\nRay is part of a big British title fight night involving Antrim southpaw Jim Montague against Clinton McKenzie for the vacant light welterweight title.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Kilclief in full flow as ‘Fin are bottled up  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA RESILIENT Kilclief outfit produced a rousing second half display to shatter Aughlisnafin\u0026rsquos championship dreams at St Colman\u0026rsquos Park, Drumaness, on Saturday.\n\nDespite going into the break only 0-6 to 0-4 down, Kilclief were staring down the barrel of an ignoble defeat after losing the influential Louis McMullan and James McGrath to early black cards.\n\nTo make matters even worse, they also lost the talismanic Ciaran Sloan to a hamstring injury and almost down to the bare bones, they looked vulnerable and there for the taking.\n\nHowever, led brilliantly by Aiden McCann and Eoin King they took the game to Aughlisnafin with a swagger and sparkle that Willie Megoran\u0026rsquos side were unable to contain.\n\nAughlisnafin were impressively out of the traps first.

The all-weather leboat under coxswain William Chambers launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali as it unleashed its devastating power.\n\nThe challenging weather conditions the crew was going to face en route to Newtownards were immediately apparent after launch, with the coxswain requesting the closure of main water tight doors as the vessel was battered by eight metre high waves.\n\nA Force 8 gale was blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough some 90 minutes after the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.\n\nOn arrival at the yacht club, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but it was subsequently confirmed there wasn\u0026rsquot.\n\nThe leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from Whiterock and Kircubbin. Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nThe  to Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at 6pm, ing home one hour later.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. \u0026ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.\n\nSome of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekend\u0026rsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellan\u0026rsquos Lower Square for generations.\n\nSlieve Croob councillor Ro\u0026iacutes\u0026iacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the town\u0026rsquos permanent Christmas tree.\n\n\u0026ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.\u0026nbsp\n\nSenior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.\u0026nbsp\n\nDuring the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland  presented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.\n\nLocal authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent platform to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.\n\nIn addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.\n\nSince March last year, the local authority\u0026rsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.\u0026nbsp\n\nGeoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.\n\nSecuring the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos tourism strategy.\n\nThe current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.\n\nThe local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.\u0026nbsp\n\nOfficials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the area\u0026rsquos signicant geological and other heritage.\n\nThere are currently 127 geoparks found in 35 countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.\n\nHowever, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurther information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/8725258.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"\n\n  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper \nStratton\n  \n    THE.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

Sir Patrick Coghlin after the Spad defended not telling the BBC the full truth of what he knew about RHI.\n\n                \nIn late 2016, the Nolan Show had asked him: “Did you or any member of your family benefit from the RHI scheme?”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nStephen Brimstone in front of the RHI Inquiry yesterday\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHis answer said that he had personally benefited from the scheme – but left out that his brother and his parents-in-law were also claimants.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone defended not answering that question fully, saying: “I didn’t feel I had to get into that [or] I was under any obligation to get into that.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe BBC also asked about a meeting between Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell which Mr Brimstone says he recalls as “angry”, but he thought it had not been about RHI.\n\nThe BBC asked him: “Did you witness a heated exchange between Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell in which Arlene Foster ordered Jonathan Bell in a highly agitated manner to keep the RHI scheme open in January 2015 [actually 2016]?\n\nMr Brimstone responded to that: “No. I did not witness any such exchange between Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell.”\n\nCounsel to the inquiry Joseph Aiken asked him: “Now, is that answer accurate to the extent that you’re saying the heated exchange was not about RHI, but you’re not acknowledging ‘well, there was a heated exchange – it just wasn’t about RHI’. Do you understand the impression that might convey is simply ‘there’s no heated exchange’?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone said: “To be honest, I was asked a question and I answered the question...the context of that question was ‘in which Arlene Foster in a highly agitated manner ordered Jonathan Bell to keep the RHI scheme open’.”\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin asked: “Were you in any way prevented from saying ‘I was present during a heated exchange, but the subject matter of that exchange was not RHI it was Bombardier and Canada?’”\n\nMr Brimstone said: “No, I wasn’t prevented from saying that.”\n\nSir Patrick said sternly: “That, according to you, is an accurate... account. Now were you in some way being inhibited because you were being talked to by the BBC? If you weren’t, why not give the full account?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone said: “I didn’t think that they needed to know about any other matters that were being discussed at that meeting. The question was specic to the RHI scheme.”\n\nSir Patrick said the answer “could be seen as highly misleading,  what you say now is true”. He added: “You know the importance of being accurate. Why not answer that question accurately?”\n\nMr Brimstone said: “Forgive me, chair, but I do believe I answered it accurately.”\n\nSir Patrick said: “For myself, I find great dficulty in understanding why  you’re asked a question that is a very important question you don’t answer it properly. You say you did answer it properly.”\n\nMr Brimstone said he did not want to volunteer the full story in case it led to follow-up questions.\n\n                            \n            \n
