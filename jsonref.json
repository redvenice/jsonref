Here he talks about growing up in working-class Ayrshire, going against the grain and the spirit of 80s post-punkEvery teenager, or every teenager who is lucky, has a Keith. Keith is the friend who jokes and dresses with more swagger than anyone else, who looks out for misfits and makes them feel understood, who is the scourge of bullies and bigots and the master of revels, who can conjure laughs from thin air on nights when you are bored and skint.Andrew O’Hagan met his Keith – Keith Martin – on the council estate near Irvine new town, on the coast of Ayrshire, 20 miles from Glasgow, where they both grew up. In the 1980s they went on CND protests and miners’ marches together, they were a wayward double-act chatting up girls, and while O’Hagan was still at school and Martin was working as a lathe-turner in a local factory, they formed a band. Thirty years later, with none of that history forgotten, it was O’Hagan who Keith Martin first called with the news no one wants to share that he had been diagnosed with inoperable cancer, and that they had at best only four months of friendship left.By then, Martin, largely at O’Hagan’s prompting, had long ago left his factory job to become an inspired and inspiring English teacher in a Glasgow secondary school. He died in 2018 aged 51. Two years on O’Hagan is publishing a novel, Mayflies – both life-loving and elegiac – written with his mate closely in mind. The book is in two halves. The first inhabits that 1980s world of record shops and dole queues and teenage kicks, and centres on a memorable weekend when Martin and O’Hagan (Tully and Jimmy in the novel) ventured south on pilgrimage to a music festival featuring the Fall and the Smiths and New Order, organised by Factory Records. “We came into Manchester like air into Xanadu,” O’Hagan writes.The second half of the novel begins in another place entirely – O’Hagan’s own current London literary world – with Jimmy coming home to his house in Primrose Hill from the book launch of a dissident Hungarian novelist in Eaton Square. It is there, armed only with a glass of scotch, that he gets the call from Tully with the fateful news.When novelists write books that are intimately close to home, they tend to lean on the clause that it’s all made up O’Hagan is keener to stress that this one – much more than his previous five novels – is nearly all true. The death of his oldest friend gave him no choice, he says, but to put aside the fiction he had been writing for several years – a big Dickensian-sounding novel, set in the present-day isions of Islington’s Caledonian Road – to make some emotional sense of those last months. As Jimmy observes, when Tully was not around, the rest of the gang always unravelled too: “That’s teenage love isn’t it? When the party is less fun because your mate is the party.”You can see some of that lost love in the photos that O’Hagan has kept of their band, which had a name for the ages, the Big Gun. Martin was spike-haired on vocals, O’Hagan shoehorned in as percussionist “shaking a tambourine and trying to look cool”. Despite a brilliant writing career that has included international prizes and visiting professorships, O’Hagan says no accolade has come close to matching the excitement he felt on hearing the Big Gun’s one and only single played on John Peel’s Radio 1 show in 1986.“The five of us were all gathered round the radio in Irvine with our quiffs when the record came on,” he recalls. “At the end Peel said, and I quote: ‘Melody arrives unheralded into the programme, that’s the Big Gun from Ayrshire. I must say I like that immoderately.’ The five of us were punching the air, and wondering what ‘immoderately’ meant.”Smash Hits magazine said the track “was the kind of single that made England great”. (O’Hagan wrote in immediately, of course: “Dear Smash Hits, we come from Scotland, so fuck you.”) The Big Gun went on a mini-tour that took in gigs in Carlisle and at a pub on London’s Seven Sisters Road, but that was the end of it. “The boys all worked in factories, we didn’t have any more tunes, and I went off to university at Strathclyde,” O’Hagan says. Still, the band had briefly done what bands used to do: it had made anything seem possible, not least the chance of escape from the bitterness of unemployed fathers and fractured families and uncertain futures, the process that O’Hagan and Martin used to dream of as “deliverance”.I’ve known O’Hagan a little for 25 years or so – we started out working on literary journals at about the same time, he at the London Review of Books, I at Granta, and drank with some of the same friends. Sitting chatting about his book a couple of weeks ago around the dining table in his beautiful house in Primrose Hill, hidden in an enclave of 19th-century artists’ studios, we talked first about male friendship.We are both of that generation that came of age between national service and social media. “Our fathers may have found their friendships in the army or in a factory,” O’Hagan says. “Our children may find them online. In between was that moment when you made half your friends at bus stops with people who had the same mission as you: heading into town to buy the new Smiths record.” There was, it turns out, a lasting camaraderie in that. “Keith was the leader of our gang,” he says. “He taught us to love the Jesus and Mary Chain and Martin Scorsese, and then, fuck me, 30 years later he was teaching me how to die.”That story is more poignant, I suggest, because their friendship already had a happy ending – they both, in different ways, had made good on their pact of deliverance. That journey, the gap between the two halves of O’Hagan’s book, is still fairytale in some ways, isn’t it?“It is exactly that,” O’Hagan says, “and I have never taken it for granted. The most dramatic ways out of childhoods like mine were boxing, a pools win, or making it in a band. My grandfather was a boxer, who died at 34. For our generation the most reliable was music. We could watch all those brilliant scallies like, say, Echo and the Bunnymen, become genuine heroes, creative, political, articulate. They showed us that it could be done.”In his writing over the years, O’Hagan has painted an affectionate portrait of himself as a young man. He was the boy who stowed books in a bread tin under his bed, hidden from the sneers of his dad, a violent alcoholic the kid with more interest in “history and flowers” than Celtic FC. Having three older brothers helped him survive. “I mean I was openly expressing interest in Virginia Woolf at school – that was basically asking to be battered. But they were quite tough my brothers, so kids left me alone.”There is a scene in this book – another true story – where O’Hagan, at 17, goes for a job interview at a yard where they make fence posts. He is given the bum’s rush halfway through explaining to the site owner why he has Jean-Paul Sartre’s Nausea in his jacket pocket. His eventual saviour – who assured him that there actually were places in the world where he would not seem deviant or worse for quoting Edith Sitwell – was an English teacher who persuaded him to stay on at school and try for university. A decade later, that teacher came to a reading O’Hagan gave in Glasgow from his first novel, Our Fathers, which had been shortlisted for the Booker prize. She told him afterwards”: “I always knew it about you, you were never going to settle for anything less than scandal or glory.”In trying to locate that place where people not only shared an interest in Edith Sitwell, but also her brothers, Sacheverell and Osbert, O’Hagan got on a bus to London from Glasgow at 21, with his worldly goods of £60 in his pocket and no plan except to doss on his friend Alan’s floor in Shepherd’s Bush. A good listener as well as a good talker, he got a job with the charity St Dunstan’s taking blind veterans of the second world war out on day trips. Reading the London Review of Books on the way home from one of those outings to the South Downs, he saw an ad for an editorial assistant and applied. Three decades on, the paper remains his literary home.I well remember the impact of O’Hagan’s first published story, at the time of the murder of James Bulger. When the whole world was calling the two-year-old’s schoolboy killers evil, O’Hagan wrote a piece recalling incidents from his own childhood that had involved situations not dissimilar to those that had ended in the child’s abduction and murder, when smaller kids would be bullied and tortured to alleviate afternoon boredom. “I had looked at the pictures of those boys leading Jamie Bulger away in the shopping centre,” he says now, “and I said to Mary-Kay Wilmers, the editor of the LRB: ‘You know, I recognise those boys, I know something about their lives.’” Wilmers told him to take the rest of the afternoon off and try to write about that. At the time, he was the most junior member of staff, mostly opening the mail. “I sat on my bed in my shared flat at the back of King’s Cross station, and stayed up all night and wrote this thing,” he says.The voice of that piece, confessional and smart, not only said something interesting and new about British childhoods, it marked O’Hagan out immediately as a rare talent. From the morning after it came out, he says, “my phone did not stop ringing for a year”. The  picked the piece up and made it a cover story: “Confessions of a literary editor”, with a picture of O’Hagan looking young and wearing a leather jacket. “I had dozens of letters from priests and social workers,” he says, “and suddenly I realised journalism was a thing, if you could describe the world honestly in your own way.”He had, he says, “a tremendous amount of pavement pounding energy” as a writer at the time. He slept nights under Waterloo Bridge to write about the homeless long after the press pack had left, he kept a daily vigil outside Fred and Rosemary West’s house, to gather material for his first book, The Missing. At the Observer magazine, back then, I commissioned him to write a story about Guy’s hospital, which was earmarked for closure. The hospital wouldn’t give him any official access, so he just sat in corridors and waiting rooms for weeks on end, talking to staff and patients, trying to get a sense of what closure would mean. People came to believe he was a porter. When the story came out, a hospital executive called me to yell about the official channels, but the story O’Hagan told hit a nerve.Insecurity has been a constant theme in his writing, the idea that everything might be taken away The Missing was a meditation on young lives that had fallen off the map, “mispers” as the police files called them. That fear was deep-rooted in him, he says.“I grew up in houses where you were always up against it. You were never sure how long you would stay there, the house was chaotic, my dad was never coming home, or coming home drunk, the rent was never paid, the electricity was always being cut off.”It is one of the reasons now, he says, that he makes every effort to make his home a sanctuary. He gestures around the room with its ceiling stencilled in colours borrowed from Italian churches, and paintings by Duncan Grant and Patrick Caulfield. “I have deliberately made this place cocoonish,” he says, as an antidote to those memories of insecurity. “It is where my wife is – and my books.” (O’Hagan has been married twice, first to the columnist India Knight, and for the past two years to Lindsey Milligan, 36, a theatre stage manager. India Knight’s subsequent partner, former Labour MP Eric Joyce, was recently convicted of making a pornographic image of a very young child O’Hagan has no wish to comment on that case in print, though he mentions that his and Knight’s daughter, Nell, 16, is living here with him and Milligan.)The reach of his sense of home extends beyond this room. He finds time to run a cafe at the end of the street, with Sam Frears, the charismatic son of Stephen and Mary-Kay Wilmers who was born with severely disabling Riley-Day syndrome – and to be a global Unicef ambassador. “For me,” O’Hagan says at one point, “the idea of society isn’t some Henry Jamesian world of dinner parties, it is being so good at being civilised that we want to let different people waft in, whatever their beginning in life.”Ever since I have known him, O’Hagan has had a gift for such wafting in, even in the most intellectually intimidating company. Where did that come from?A good deal of it was to do with drink, he suggests. But partly it was a faith in that feeling he got from 80s bands: “Joy Division didn’t ask for permission to speak,” he says. “They didn’t apply to Oxbridge. The music just announced: ‘We’re here too’.” In that spirit, he says: “I’ve never been in a room in my life when I felt like the underdog. I didn’t allow myself to feel that. I made sure I had plenty to say to Lord Fuckface or whoever standing next to me, and just as importantly made sure to listen carefully to what he had to say.”Most of the best advice he ever had as writer, he has said, came from Mailer. “He knew the industry could make writers soft and silly – hungry for recognition, when the real task was to enter your times and write your heart out and never settle for having the correct opinions.”That determination to “enter his times” and follow the truth as he has discovered it rather than simply deliver “correct opinions”, has inevitably made him an occasional target in the current pathology of outrage. In 2013 O’Hagan agreed to ghostwrite the autobiography of Julian Assange, who had secured a seven-figure global book contract. He took on the job in part because he believed WikiLeaks might help to change the world for the better by making government more transparent. In his dealings with Assange over many months, however – a saga he subsequently detailed in a suitably indiscreet long essay – he found the hacker to be “entirely duplicitous and a megalomaniac, and if saying that put me on the wrong side of a culture war for some people, then so be it.”His second experience of going against consensus came in his extraordinary report into the Grenfell Tower fire. O’Hagan rented an office in the shadow of the tower and over the course of a year interviewed hundreds of people – survivors, campaigners, firefighters, social workers, politicians – who had been involved. On the eve of the official inquiry the LRB gave over its whole edition to his 65,000 words which prompted enormous praise and vitriol at equal extremes. O’Hagan’s thoughtful and balanced conclusions were not to the taste of those activists who wanted no deviation from a party line that the tragedy was to be blamed entirely on corporate negligence and wilful callousness by the Tories on Kensington and Chelsea council.He sees that response as a symptom of a dangerous world in which the goal of nuanced and objective reporting is itself considered an ideological failing he was criticised even for listening to all points of view. (When I talked to some of those Grenfell activists for a story a year later, nothing made them angrier than mention of “Andrew O’Hateful”). “I have spent my life as someone who is all ears for injustice and wrongdoing,” O’Hagan says. “But accusations shouted loudly on social media are not evidence.”O’Hagan does not believe that a social media presence should be any part of the “job of a writer”. He still uses a typewriter for most of his work to avoid the lazier temptations of cut and paste, the piece on Grenfell was handwritten. Neither was he unsettled by the criticism. “If you have not suffered a Twitter pile-on as a journalist these days, you cannot be doing your job properly,” he says. Little deflects him from work. On the table next to us as we speak there is a brimming bowl of pencils, each sharpened to a point.“The luckiest thing that ever happened to me as a writer is that I don’t get depressed,” he says. “It is almost a gargantuan unfairness. All my friends who are writers have suffered at one time or another with the black dog. I’ve never had that.”Some of it has to do with counting his blessings, he suggests. More, perhaps, an unwavering drive to confront “his material” honestly on the page, to “write his heart out” as Mailer instructed Mayflies is a case in point.O’Hagan was already thinking about the joy and loss of friendship when he received the news of Keith Martin’s terminal illness. About a year earlier he had written a characteristic piece in the New York Times about losing touch with his very first childhood friend, a boy called Mark McDonald, of whom he could find not a trace on the internet or anywhere else. “That piece was like a premonition,” he says now. “Mark was a boyhood friend, rather than a teenage one, and he just disappeared from our lives.” He concluded that story with the faith that “the only kind of loyalty that matters is to know your friends and stick with them”.Some of the most telling passages in Mayflies are those in which O’Hagan details the ways that he and Martin – Tully and Jimmy – established that loyalty, never letting the other go under. When O’Hagan needed to escape the more chaotic extremes of home, he could always find a hot meal and a sofa at his mate’s house. Later, when he went off to university, he literally gave all his books and even his bookshelves to Martin, with the instruction to read them and follow him. “He did the work and became this magical English teacher at Eastbank academy in Glasgow, talking to kids about books and films and music just as he had talked about them to us.” In his last weeks, Martin spent some time at a caravan O’Hagan owns on the coast near West Kilbride, a place they both loved his ashes were scattered at an appropriate spot near there, the Brither Rocks – the brother rocks.A few days after our interview, I asked O’Hagan if he had a copy of the single he made with the Big Gun – of course he does – and he sent me over a scratchy recording of it, along with a picture of its homemade Letraset sleeve. It’s a driving and boisterous guitar track with a Buzzcocks-inspired hook. Listening to Martin’s voice across the years, with just a hint of O’Hagan’s tambourine in the background, is to understand exactly the lasting bond that informs the novel. The track is called Heard About Love. As John Peel might have observed of the friendship behind that implied question, “Immoderately”.• Mayflies is published by Faber on 3 September (£14.99).

If you’re feeling more laid back, you can just hit the tub and let the world scurry on by.Lough Erne Resort, County FermanaghIf you’re after absolute luxury, why not go the whole hog? The sprawling, castellated Lough Erne Resort, housed on its own 243-hectare (600-acre) peninsula between the reedy shores of Lower Lough Erne and Castle Hume Lough, just outside Enniskillen, really is the last word in refinement.Starting your day with a choice between the resort’s two world-class golf courses sounds like our kind of dilemma: the Faldo course has been represented globally by local son Rory McIlroy, who holds the course record.For those who don’t have the golf bug, take heart: with an incredible Thai spa, world-class restaurants and access to the 40-mile-long splendour of Lough Erne, you’ll be fine.If it’s good enough to host the not-unpicky G8 summit (as it did in 2013), Lough Erne Resort is sure to satisfy your own exacting standards …And those who are after quality local food won’t need to look further than the resort’s Catalina restaurant, where guests can dine in luxury after a long day of exploring.Larchfield Estate, Lisburn, County AntrimIt’s fair to say Myrtle has been around for a while, seen a few tight squeezes, and is always ready with a warm welcome for her guests. Don’t worry, she’s not an over-friendly local – Myrtle is a lovingly-restored 1952 Saurer Swiss Army truck that now serves as one of Northern Ireland’s most inspiring glamping options at the gorgeous Larchfield Estate.The accommodation is suitably cosy and stylish, equipped with a log-burning stove, sun deck and a sauna housed in its own wooden pod with bucolic views of the surrounding greenery. Rise and shine after a night with Myrtle and set off to explore the 243-hectare (600-acre) estate. Mission accomplished.Killeavy Castle Estate, County ArmaghA gothic flight of fantasy built in 1836, Killeavy Castle is both grand and cosy: it features imposing medieval-style doors and turrets, yet the restored pile makes room for just four luxurious bedrooms within its castellated walls. Wake to the view from any of its 52 windows and you’ll feel like landed gentry.Elsewhere on the estate, the original mill, gatehouse and coach house have all been converted into stylish accommodation. There’s also a high-end spa, all on 142 hectares (350 acres) in the shadow of Slieve Gullion, the tallest mountain in County Armagh.Famed for its locally sourced food, Killeavy Castle Estate provides everything from sublime seven-course tasting menus to a famously good fry-up for breakfast.That’s your morning plans sorted.Palace Street Apartments, Derry-LondonderryPass through the famed city walls at the ornate Bishop’s Gate, then hang a sneaky left, and you’ll find yourself in a barely car-width street lined on one side by the kind of Victorian red brick you’d expect to see in an adaptation of Dickens.It’s also the very fitting home of the Palace Street Apartments, a lovingly restored, three-unit, self-catering gem. Step outside in the morning and you’ll find all of Derry-Londonderry at your feet. Within the confines of the old walled city, you’re only a stroll away from the historic Guildhall (as well-known for its political history as for its appearance in Derry Girls), St Columba’s Cathedral, where the original keys of the city are held, and the Diamond war memorial.That said, dark wood, oiled leather, antique furniture and deep beds come as standard in each apartment, making going outside an optional extra.Finn Lough, County FermanaghA lot has been written about the bubble domes at the eco-conscious Finn Lough resort in Fermanagh, but nothing can prepare you for the experience of waking snug and cosy in a luxury bed, and opening your eyes to see the dawn sky straight above you.These transparent domes offer uninterrupted views of the surrounding nature alongside high-end creature comforts: four-poster beds, ensuite bathrooms, and coffee machines to ease you into the morning the right way.Once you’ve recovered from the majesty of the morning there are woodland trails to explore, on foot or cycle, and a lake to linger by. There’s also a top-tier spa for those who aim simply to “sleep well, be pampered” – and who can blame them, when your bed is this spectacular?Come on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345c28211f4ca1ea57842a60109e9d76c3d87992/0_116_6242_3745/master/6242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b59877834e5319eb717de6309ac0365b","title":"surf cycle or hike go wild on northern irelands adventure coast","story":"Where can you hike along a world-heritage coastline, ride an Atlantic wave, then cycle around a puffin colony, all within a few miles of each other? The answer is along Northern Ireland’s Causeway CoastWhether you like to explore on foot, by bike or by water, Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast could be the most scenic part of the UK you’ve never visited. Yet its natural attractions and ersity of landscapes make it perfect for anyone with an adventurous heart.Here we pick a few of Northern Ireland’s outdoor highlights, though the full range of opportunities extend far beyond what’s mentioned here. The best advice? Book a week and discover the possibilities for yourself.Explore by footAt the tip of Northern Ireland lies its most famous attraction – the Unesco world heritage site of the Giant’s Causeway. And there’s no better way to reach it than on foot, by following an eight-mile section of the Causeway Coast Way. Begin at picturesque Ballintoy Harbour, which Game of Thrones fans will recognise as a setting for the Iron Islands. Then head west along the signed coast path, passing sandy beaches, rock arches and a ruined clifftop castle before finishing at the Giant’s Causeway. The 40,000 interlocking basalt columns provide a fitting finale to one of the best walks in Northern Ireland.For something completely different, head to nearby Glenariff Forest Park. Set within the celebrated Glens of Antrim, the scenery here transports you to another world. Expect numerous waterfalls, wooden walkways deep within river gorges, and long-distance views along chiselled glacial escarpments. Signed hiking circuits of different lengths mean there’s a route for walkers of all abilities.Explore by bikeIf two wheels are your thing, Rathlin Island offers an outing that will remain etched in your memory for years to come. Lying six miles off the coast, the trip begins with a ferry ride from Ballycastle marina. You’ll need to bring your own bike due to Covid-19 restrictions, but the island can be explored in a few hours. The highlight is the eight-mile return trip to its western tip. Here the land ends in sheer cliffs that are home to both a lighthouse and Northern Ireland’s largest breeding seabird colony. There’s no better way to break your ride than descending to the RSPB viewing platform and, if you’re here at the right time of year – between April and August – watching the antics of hundreds of thousands of nesting birds. Regardless of when you visit, the views remain breathtaking all year round, and the sensual assault of sound and smell makes the trip back to the harbour feel positively peaceful.For a longer journey, back on the mainland try the signed cycle route between the Giant’s Causeway and Benone. This 22-mile trip can be completed in either direction, and follows a mixture of public roads and traffic-free paths. The ride takes you through the coastal towns of Portrush, Portstewart and Castlerock, with numerous opportunities to explore sandy beaches or stop for refreshments along the way.Explore by waterAnother great option is to leave the land altogether, and explore the unique coastline from the sea. This is a shore littered with caves, arches, tunnels and cliffs, and the only way to appreciate them fully is from the water.Sea kayaking is a great option, with several local companies providing all the equipment and guidance you need to begin weaving silently between the headlands. Choose from a half-day or full-day excursion, with incredible coastal scenery interspersed by a snack or lunch in some tucked-away cove along the way.If you’d prefer to embrace the waves then there’s the chance to try surfing instead – the neighbouring towns of Portrush and Portstewart are the twin meccas for local surfers. Hire a wetsuit and surfboard from the back of the beach, book into a lesson, then hit the waves. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, you’re guaranteed a great time, with watery thrills and spills all part of the fun.Novices and experts are also welcomed by the local sailing centres. Take a lesson or join a skippered yacht for a longer adventure, spending anything from an hour to a whole weekend on the water. With the emphasis on guests doing as much of the sailing as possible, it won’t be long before you know your jib from your gybe.Something differentOf course the activities mentioned here just scrape the surface of what’s available, and with a little imagination almost anything is possible. How about a catch-and-sea boat trip, where you start by going sea fishing, then return to watch a professional chef prepare your bounty, garnished by other local delicacies?Or a horse ride, featuring a gentle hack through the glens or an adrenaline-filled canter across the beach? Organised scuba ing, coasteering it’s all here, with countless options to suit all ages and abilities.So what’s keeping you away? The Causeway Coast is a goldmine of activities and opportunities, its charms are just waiting to be discovered.Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the mini-bus tour, bird sanctuary and bike hire are not currently available, for more information visit: rathlincommunity.orghomeCome on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2046b723b0576bbe9f8b394953ee801f3ecf099f/0_189_5200_3119/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09294831766449fd6514bc31d541078b","title":"how a hotel hero saved my family holiday","story":"When my son lost his security blanket, disaster loomed. But I hadn’t counted on the superhuman efforts of our hostsIt doesn’t matter how or why, because I would never invade my children’s privacy like that, but a week ago a tiny piece of rag, full of holes and no longer blue, was left, let’s say by me (it wasn’t me), in a hotel. It used to be a blanket. It is still known to us domestically as Blanket. It smells of off milk in that way that everything too fragile to wash eventually does. It has been with us for nearly 13 years. Nobody knows for how much longer it will be needed, but please don’t triangulate this information to get any clues as to the age of the child who cares for it so deeply.We were in Portugal, me and two children whose privacy I would never invade. We had arrived at our second destination, passed a delightful day and came to around bedtime, when one said: “Where’s Blanket?” I replied: “You tell me – it’s your blanket.” And the other one said: “I told you he didn’t check his room.” And the first took on an expression of blind panic that I recognised from the time I drove out of a motorway service station forgetting the dog.As the options unfolded, it was soon plain to me that we would never see Blanket again. It was probably too small to find, and anyone who did find it would immediately throw it out, preferably with tongs. “Sometimes when we lose things,” I started gamely, “subconsciously, it’s because we’re ready to lose them.”Look, I am not the thought police, I wouldn’t press charges but in that moment I would say he was ready to strangle me. This, I thought, is going to be a long holiday, and not in a good way. I emailed the hotel under the pressure of his hooded gaze, not because I thought there was any point doing so.They found it. The staff at Quinta dos Poetas Nature hotel, already quite the destination because of its turtles, went through their rubbish, found a tiny piece of rag and got it back to us. Then the obligatory Tripadvisor review request came through, but I don’t know how to give a critical opinion on this kind of heroism. It would be like trying to give Superman a quarterly appraisal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b3f5728bd5ac96268397b6b29a651ee29dd3733/0_166_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ad1ed79992ab33c5705791e4ae77ed1b","title":"english universities peril 10 years calamitous reform higher education","story":"Market-driven higher education has become a de facto endorsement of our class-ided society, not the cureJust as a prolonged drought reveals previously obscured contours in the landscape, so the coronavirus pandemic has revealed, with disturbing clarity, fault lines in our society. The shambles that passes for Tory education policy in England and Wales exaggerates these through its combination of incompetence and ideology.But although it’s tempting to discuss the recent exams fiasco entirely in terms of ministerial inadequacy, what the debate around this issue has revealed are unsettling tensions in our current assumptions about the nature and role of higher education and its relation to wider society. And we can none of us claim to be merely outraged observers in this matter: we are all implicated in these contradictions.One of the most obvious is between our de facto endorsement of a bitterly class-ided society and our fantasy that universities can not only escape the consequences of this but can positively correct it. We seem, for example, to be willing to allow wealthy parents to buy educational advantage for their children up to the age of 18, but then we believe that this advantage can somehow be made to have no consequences for their educational trajectory thereafter.We profess to be shocked that those from disadvantaged backgrounds do less well in the scramble for places, but we strain every sinew to give our own children an edge in this scramble. Many parents seem to regard universities primarily as a filtering mechanism for employment. The “better” the university their child can go to, the better their chances of a job that will insure them against the worst ravages of an unforgivingly competitive society.One reason why further education is the Cinderella sector is that the parents of those who tend to go into further education are nowhere near so powerful and noisy a voice as the parents of those who tend to go to universities.The truth is that if you say you want more children from deprived areas to be able to go to university, then don’t faff around with entry tariffs: invest in Sure Start centres, preschool groups, subsidised childcare and properly resourced primary schools. Make benefits genuinely accessible and life-supporting. Better still, stop whole sections of society being condemned to underpaid, vulnerable, soul-destroying labour while others cream off inordinate wealth from the profits of that labour.But don’t kid yourself that the odd bit of “widening access” will in itself provide a magic bullet and thereby allow you, the beneficiary of a rigged competition, to sleep soundly at night.Then there is the rather less obvious contradiction between consumerism and education. Our higher education system is at present structurally consumerist. Even now, it is not widely understood how revolutionary were the changes introduced in 2010-12 by the coalition government in England and Wales (Scotland wisely followed another course). It wasn’t simply a “rise in fees”. It was a redefinition of universities in terms of a market model. The Office for Students is explicitly a “consumer watchdog”. Consumers are defined by their wants in exchange for payment they are “entitled” to get what they ask for.The core experience of life-changing education is almost the exact opposite of this. It involves engaging with what is not us. It’s not about studying something we can “identify” with: it’s about encountering manifold forms of otherness it’s about coming to understand things we didn’t previously know existed it’s about struggling with the knotty intractability of how the world is, rather than how we like to think of it. Given this contradiction, there are few more pathetic sights than Tory backbenchers bleating about “grade inflation” while insisting that universities must provide “value for money” by “giving students what they want”.Then there is the tension, though it may be unpopular to articulate it, between thinking of universities as a continuation of school and thinking of them as having a lot of functions in addition to undergraduate education. Those who urge that we move to “comprehensive universities”, on the model of comprehensive schools, taking all 18-year-olds from a given area regardless of grades in A-levels or equivalent exams, may be animated by admirably egalitarian convictions. But quite apart from the immediate resistance such a scheme would encounter from the dominant consumerism – “I want my children to be able to choose which (better) university they go to” – this neglects all those other functions.Universities are, by a long way, the main centres of research and scholarship in our societies they curate the greater part of our intellectual and cultural inheritance they provide by far the best source of disinterested expertise they select and prepare those who will be the scholars and scientists of the future, and so on. Countries all over the world have found that you cannot fulfil these functions by distributing students and academics across all institutions either uniformly or randomly. Some element of selection and concentration is needed, and that brings with it some element of hierarchy, however unofficial. Explicit differentiation of function among higher education institutions might well be preferable to any pretence that they are all doing the same thing and doing it equally well.Finally, there is the tension between wanting an ever-increasing number of people to attend university and wanting to have “world-leading” institutions. In recent years it’s become something of a mantra that the great “success” of the coalition’s higher education policy was to get more children going to universities. One of that government’s most market-driven measures – the removal of an agreed cap on numbers that each university could take – has been credited with “enabling more school-leavers to realise their dreams”.But in practice, as some of them are discovering, it’s more a question of realising their nightmares. Universities are overcrowded and understaffed contact hours are reduced most teaching in the first two years is done by temporary and part-time staff and underprepared students suffer debilitating stress. Moreover, instead of reliably leading to a better job, all it guarantees is a higher tax bill for the next 30 years.Meanwhile, universities lower down the pecking order lose student numbers to their more favourably placed “competitors”, leading to desperate attempts at “recruitment”, the firing of staff, and the possibility of bankruptcy. Yes, it’s all been a wonderful success, hasn’t it?Entrenched contradictions of the kind I’ve itemised here can’t be wished away overnight. But bringing them to the surface should at least disabuse us of any lingering notion that the present system is working well. The past 10 years have seen a revolution from above that has, by its lights, been successful: our universities have been remade. The chaos around us is conclusive evidence of that.• Stefan Collini is professor emeritus of English literature and intellectual history at the University of Cambridge.

When her mother asked why, she answered: “AnneAnne told me that when she goes, she’ll be in heaven – and if I open the window I can talk to her in the sky.”Maya and her 10-year-old brother Ediz are now preparing to go back to school, and more than anything, the family are just hoping they can start getting back to some kind of normality.Her brother Ediz, is perhaps feeling a little more anxious – but more about the fact he is entering into year 6 and has Sats ahead of him.“It feels kind of weird because everyone has been at home and we haven’t seen each other for a while,” he says. “But we’ve been on Zoom and playing games and quizzes and board games also some of my friends came to play outside. I’m really looking forward to seeing my friends.”According to Ediz’s mother, he has developed an obsession with the way Germany has dealt with the crisis, and an interest in statistics. “I get angry with the people who don’t take it seriously,” he says. “Some countries are going into second lockdown and it could last for years and years.”Both Maya and Ediz went back to Bounds Green school, north London, before the summer holiday as children of a key worker, and Selda says they have been overwhelmed by the love and support they have received.Selda’s mother, Samime, 79, became ill with coronavirus towards the end of March. Her father was also ill and the children developed fevers. But despite excellent care at home – Selda’s sister, father and brother-in-law are doctors – Samime’s condition worsened and she had to be taken into hospital. No family visits were allowed and – at that early stage of the crisis – no video contact was available. She died a week later.In the days and weeks that followed, the school, says Selda, rescued them. “My husband is a GP, but school reached out to us because they knew what we were going through,” she says. “So they went in three days a week, to give them a bit of normality.”Her middle son, nine-year-old Adem, goes to a special school, but as he had been at Bounds Green previously the school offered to care for him so he could be with his siblings, before he then went back to his own school. “The school completely saved us really,” she says. “We had a lot to deal with and they were there for us and the children.”The children’s commissioner has called for grieving children to be given access to counselling and mental health support in school, but Selda, who runs Singalong with Selda and was a primary school teacher for two decades, says she believes this support should be available in all schools, and not just for grieving children. “The school has been so nurturing that I really think they will be looked after. The kids will be on their radar and we’ve had excellent communication with them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1764c81c8f385419243ae91263d137b964e47833/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80922c1a60073167bf2a1c2a266e81ea","title":"yellowstone geyser erupts giantess","story":"Giantess is one of the biggest geysers in the national park, and typically explodes between twice and six times a year In these troubled times there comes a point where we all need to let off steam.For this huge geyser in Yellowstone park, the moment was now and the eruption was spectacular, after a six-year wait.But, for the rest of us, watching this natural phenomenon is strangely meditative and beautifully distracting from much of the bad news around, despite the violent geothermal forces propelling it.Giantess Geyser spouted for the first time in more than six years in Yellowstone National Park, which straddles part of Wyoming and a little of Montana, on 25 August, according to the US National Park Service (NPS).“She” has more typically erupted between twice and six times a year in the past, according to the NPS website, and blasts a spout up to 200ft high.“The surrounding area may shake from underground steam explosions just before the initial water andor steam eruptions,” the NPS website adds.Giantess is one of the biggest geysers in the park, alongside phenomena such as the super-tall Steamboat geyser, the largest active geyser in the world, and the park’s most famous, Old Faithful, renowned for its punctual regularity as it soars from the ground around 20 times a day.Colorful hot spring features in the park include the blue-hued Morning Glory Pool and the psychedelic Grand Prismatic spring, as well as whiffy, sulfurous bubblers and roiling natural pots of scalding hot water fizzing out of the rocks.The features are among more than 10,000 hot springs and geysers in the park, a Unesco world heritage site."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f9052808b3600503e33763a14d057f0b5bcb58/356_99_1634_980/master/1634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f40f309c1ac69f6530ecb16971dcef8b","title":"chadwick boseman a life in pictures","story":"The US actor best known for his role as T’Challa in Black Panther, has died at the age of 43.

Superb in the first half, resolute in the second, they are European champions again, captain Wendie Renard lifting a trophy she and they have now won seven times. A 3-1 win over Wolfsburg continues their dominance, goals from Eugénie Le Sommer, Saki Kumagai and Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir seeing them end another untouchable season showered with confetti, this time in San Sebastián.The Icelander, who joined Lyon from Wolfsburg only last month and would have been eligible for a medal whoever won, barely celebrated when she got the late goal that finally secured the trophy in what were shaping up to be difficult final minutes. Her teammates, though, did, subs streaming on to the pitch to join them at the final whistle. They are used to winning but it is a feeling they continue to chase voraciously, driven by players that are still the envy of the continent.Two up by half time, Lyon saw Wolfsburg pull one back to make it 2-1 and threaten to drag this game into extra time, just like the previous two times they met in the final. But then as the minutes ticked away and the tension built, Lyon escaped to victory. Le Sommer smashed a shot that hit Gunnarsdóttir and went in from a couple of yards.Ultimately there could be no complaints – even if for Wolfsburg, going through it all again, it felt cruel. Twice winners, they have now lost three finals and two quarter-finals to Lyon, their European adventure ending against the same opponents five years running.There was optimism that this time might be different. Lyon had not always convinced in northern Spain and were without Ada Hegerberg and Nikita Parris, their two top scorers. They did, though, have Delphine Cascarino. Or did they have two? In a superb first half, she seemed to be everywhere, Lyon beginning on the front foot, determined to reassert their authority, not allowing room for Wolfsburg to believe. It’s us, remember.It was too, any hit of vulnerability vanishing. Kumagai and Gunnarsdóttir imposed authority in the middle. Le Sommer was lively. Dzsenifer Marozsán picked out passes, a floated free-kick allowing the towering Renard to connect with the first of two headers that might have troubled Wolfsburg more. And on the right, Cascarino flew, delivering an early warning with some gorgeous footwork and not letting up until the break.Lyon kept possession Cascarino was possessed. One run drew a sharp save from Friederike Abt. Next, an astonishing touch took her away from Alexandra Popp. And then she provided the first goal, intervening three times in the move before turning a sharp, clever ball back for Le Sommer to score at the second attempt.Cascarino was not done. Poor Sara Doorsoun-Khajeh, who had to deal with her, soon was – with the French winger running at her again, a desperate tackle left a twisted knee. Her replacement at full-back, Dominique Janssen, immediately befell a similar fate: Cascarino bamboozled her too, wonderful skill preceding a cross which, half-cleared, eventually found Kumagai to score an excellent second from the edge of the area.Lyon were on their way, it seemed. The second half began with Cascarino finding Le Sommer again, the threat of more. But Wolfsburg reacted, pressure built and soon there was a way back into this. Dashing from deep, Pernille Harder slipped the ball left for Fridolina Rolfö, overlapping outside. Her cross came to Ewa Pajor and, whether by accident or design, she turned it into Popp. The midfielder, a qualified zoo keeper, headed home inside the six-yard box. This was a contest now.Wolfsburg, a quick, direct side adept at invading the space behind the defence, began to find space and room to run. Lyon no longer looked in control, the energy dropping and the ball not sticking now. Lucy Bronze increasingly had to go head to head with the impressive Rolfö, a battle building as Wolfsburg looked to the wing for a way through.But Lyon are a side of character as well as quality, Bronze rose to the challenge supported by Kadeisha Buchanan, and collectively the champions resisted, holding what they had: a fifth consecutive European Cup. When the ball flew in off the heel of Gunnarsdóttir with two minutes left, it was theirs again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb809772913361176f254957836fd029a932b8f/0_318_4571_2744/master/4571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ff5b94a0ee89ac84cad7dfd342847e","title":"premier league 2020 21 preview no 1 arsenal","story":"FA Cup glory came ahead of schedule for Mikel Arteta but he may need to be patient to complete his planned transformation  writers’ predicted position: 6th (NB: this is not necessarily Nick Ames’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 40-1Make it two that got away. The manner in which Serge Gnabry escaped Arsenal’s clutches is well known. Gnabry had verbally agreed a new contract before travelling to the 2016 Olympics with Germany, but instead signed for Werder Bremen and the rest is painful modern history. But it is less well documented that Kingsley Coman could have been an Arsenal player, too. Coman was leaving Paris Saint-Germain when he and his agent visited Arsenal’s training ground in 2014, with the club willing to pay a compensation fee in the low hundred-thousands and a seven-figure salary. But the transfer did not get over the line instead Coman and Gnabry were fundamental to the outcome of this year’s Champions League and one figure close to both missed deals is only half-joking when he says he has to switch channels within five minutes when Bayern Munich pop up on his television.The point of the story? It is that, for all the recriminations of the last half-decade, a couple of relatively minor deviations might have seen Arsenal’s recent past look decidedly different. They need these things to start going their way and that is why the vision and clarity shown during Arteta’s first eight months are tantalising. Arteta’s intention to become a top coach was well trailed but, as many others have found, walking the talk can be rather more difficult. So if he is for real, as seems increasingly certain, the possibilities begin to appear limitless.Arteta could thank Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for Arsenal’s FA Cup win, given the captain’s doubles against Manchester City and Chelsea, but could also reflect on tactics that had deservedly outdone superior sides. The troubled squad he inherited has been treated with varying levels of light and shade. Matteo Guendouzi and Mesut Özil were left in no doubt about what happens to anyone Arteta feels has not nailed their colours to the cause, but he has seemingly persuaded a previously sceptical Aubameyang to see out his top-level playing career at the club. Granit Xhaka was also convinced to reverse from the exit door while Willian, who should be an excellent addition even if a three-year contract makes the eyes water, has admitted to being enamoured of Arteta’s plans.It appears Arteta has an uncanny ability to bring others with him. While Aubameyang’s chip at Wembley ensured Arteta’s Arsenal won a major trophy ahead of schedule, the coming season will show whether the vessel is a hydrofoil or a paddle steamer. Arteta has no interest in seeing Arsenal become accustomed to playing like underdogs, as they did so successfully in those big wins – Liverpool were another scalp – at the end of 2019-20. He wants to see them dominate the ball and be aggressive with it to pass and probe as forcefully as, in the weeks after the Covid-19 shutdown, his forwards pressed defenders when out of possession.That will take time and Arteta is likely to find one transfer window is not enough. He has, in theory at least, the hands-on role in recruitment that he wanted, with Raul Sanllehi taken out of the picture. Willian’s versatility and fluid movements will help an attack that, with Özil requiring a truly Lazarus-like comeback to regain favour, otherwise sorely lacks guile. Gabriel Magalhães looks sure to arrive from Lille and, with William Saliba now available, Arsenal have the kind of young, dominant, athletic centre-back options an often chaotic backline has sorely lacked. But players will have to depart if a troubled midfield is to be supplemented with top-level talent. It is hard to see their longstanding pursuit of Atlético Madrid’s Thomas Partey bearing fruit, for example, unless at least one of Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira departs. The summer has been expensive and Arsenal, who recently made 55 redundancies in non-football areas, have to start bringing money back in.So Arteta may find more compromises have to be made: a few more grinding wins over the Champions League qualifiers or afternoons where, if the ball will not do the work, the most important thing is to keep the back door bolted. He has shown he can get results now he must keep them coming while turning Arsenal into a living iteration of his blueprint. Bayern’s blistering wingers may have long gone, but Arteta is capable of banishing those regrets for good.They have retained the same colours but Arsenal are, in other ways, chameleons. First they swapped south-east London, where they were born, for Highbury in 1913. Then they became entertainers, trailblazers and innovators under the inspirational Herbert Chapman. Fast-forward half a century and they had become the “boring”, attritional but storied grinders of the 1980s and early 1990s. Now they are expected to live up to the near-impossible standards set by Arsène Wenger in the first decade of his reign, the “Arsenal way” cast as a sleek and stylish brand of attacking football that has materialised only in spurts since their move to the shiny Emirates in 2006.On the touchline Arteta usually plumps for brooding all-black getup, effortlessly straddling the gap between “slung together” and “painstakingly thought-through”. He covers plenty of ground and rattles through his body of foreign languages: English, Spanish, French and Portuguese feature in his exhortations.On Zoom Punctual, personable and sometimes perfunctory. Arteta tends to give off the air of a man fulfilling a commitment but understands the power of the medium too. His views on Guendouzi, Özil and even the club’s ambition were aired eloquently and – sometimes – bluntly.Anyone citing the importance of Aubameyang would be excused for feeling like a stuck record but, assuming his deal goes through as expected, he will be fundamental to anything Arsenal and Arteta achieve. If you are moulding a new, young defence and a more balanced midfield it helps to have the ision’s best striker.Stan Kroenke and his firm, Kroenke Sports and Entertainment, have been at the helm since 2011. Recent seasons have seen a rise in “Get out of our club” chants, with a decidedly un-touchy-feely approach to ownership doing the Kroenkes few favours. The hope is this season begins to reverse the decline they have overseen.Arteta has spoken glowingly about Reiss Nelson, saying he has “the potential to do whatever he wants”. It is time for the 20-year-old to deliver: he has bundles of talent and showed it in patches last season, scoring against Liverpool and shining in the cup against Leeds and Portsmouth. But can he impose himself consistently?The arrivals of Willian and – hopefully – Gabriel have been well trailed. A less high-profile newcomer, Andreas Georgson, formerly Brentford’s head of set pieces and inidual development, has been enlisted to keep Arsenal sharp and smart from free-kicks and corners.It is a story as old as the hills – or at least dating to the club’s foundation in 1886, when Nottingham Forest donated a set of dark red shirts and white shorts after a plea from two former players who had wound up with the Gunners. Herbert Chapman thought of the sleeves, and the lighter shade of red, years later.The jokes about an empty Emirates differing little from the full-fat experience were worn out quickly. There have not been many innovations to separate Arsenal’s home from the rest, save for the usual tailored seat coverings and pre-match music playlists.A major tournament in 2020 would probably have come too soon for Bukayo Saka. Next summer, though, is another scenario entirely and if he continues to grow in stature it is hard to see him not getting an England call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d15d4b8d7b2213b55d72563c6ba11831d68b6134/0_1121_8272_4963/master/8272.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=59a8f824d84798e7fa729b429a0e7f5a","title":"truly madly deeply meet the people turning their basements into secret fantasy worlds","story":"It’s one thing turning your basement into a wine cellar, but some people are building replica streets, theme parks and even trains beneath their homesWhen Jason Shron and his wife, Sidura, were house hunting in 2007, the Canadian model-train-seller would always head to the basement before viewing any other room. In fact, Shron had only viewed the basement of his current family home when he told his estate agent he’d purchase the property: provided Sidura liked the upstairs, he was ready to go. Shron needed the perfect basement because, for nearly 30 years, he had dreamed of building a life-size replica of a 1970s Canadian VIA Rail railway carriage inside his house, the exact train that took him from Toronto to Montreal to visit his grandmother when he was a little boy.Step inside Shron’s basement today and you will be greeted by a 200lb blue-and-yellow train door. As you pass through it, an MP3 player will hiss the sounds of air circulation accompanied by the squeaking of gangway connections. Inside the carriage there are rows of vintage reclinable red-and-orange-striped seats, luggage racks, a real VIA garbage can removed from a scrapped train and a metal sign instructing passengers that smoking is indeed permitted. What Shron couldn’t find on the scrap heap, he made. He printed out orange litter bags, custom-printed napkins and engraved wine glasses.“The great thing was it ended up looking exactly as I’d envisioned it,” the 45-year-old says of his basement train, which took him four-and-a-half years to build and cost $10,000 (the scrapped carriage alone cost $5,000). “I fell in love with VIA trains from the age of two – I became madly obsessed, it’s all I would talk about, all I wanted.” Shron recreated the train that he took to visit family to tap into “that very warm, comfortable, positive energy” he felt as a child. “I get a little bit of that every time I go down to the train.”Shron’s basement is an unusual thing, but it is perhaps a little more common than you’d expect. A number of people have created their own “worlds” underneath their homes. In late May, the listing for a Maryland mansion went viral after a Twitter user discovered a fake town inside the basement. The basement features cobbled streets, 15 shopfronts, fake flowers and real vintage cars. But even this isn’t unusual. More than a decade ago, a YouTube video documented the basement of John Scapes, an Illinois man who had built an 1890s street under his home.Across the Atlantic, Shron’s train and the Maryland town aren’t anomalies either. In December 2019, an American man made headlines for transforming his basement into a replica Blockbuster video store, with row after row of rental vids and a snack stand. Seven months earlier, a woman in Canada transformed the space under her stairs into Narnia. Just before that, a Harry Potter fan magazine documented a woman who had created wizarding streets complete with shop windows in her basement. American and Canadian basements are now home to life-size bakeries and wine shops, casinos and arcades. What possesses someone to create their own private world in their basement? What compels them to spend so much money and time bringing their vision to life? And is an underground fantasy-land actually beneficial, particularly when public spaces are shutting down because of the pandemic?Angela Burns has a village inside her home. In 2012, the 66-year-old builder and designer completed her New Jersey mansion, which she designed with 10ft ceilings in the basement. You enter the space and arrive at a village square, which ides into two cobblestone streets lined with real, functional shops. There’s a coffee shop, a hotdog stand, a wine shop, a bakery, an ice-cream parlour, a pretzel stand, a pizza stall and a newsstand. There’s also an arcade, a bar, a poker room and a 20-seat cinema featuring a concessions kiosk and ticket booth. There’s fake brickwork, fake wooden store signs, fake awnings and fake shop windows. The ceilings are painted blue to mimic the feeling of being outside. The entire basement cost Burns $250,000 (around £190,000, which is just £40,000 under the average price of a UK home).“It was like building a movie set,” Burns says of creating her miniature world. The hardest part was securing fake cobblestones. Originally, she wanted to use real paving stones, but they were too thick and she feared they might cause people to trip. Instead, she opted for a driveway covering that a tiler could lay.Why did she create the space to be so unfailingly realistic? “I wanted it to be something that people find interesting and fun and unique.”Throughout her career designing homes, Burns began to notice that many people would only use one part of a basement and ignore the rest of the space, and she wanted to change things around. She built a spaceship in the basement of her previous home, inspired by episodes of Star Trek the ceiling lit up like the night sky. “It was a really popular thing,” she says. “I had several bids on the house and the people who bought it kept it all.”Burns’s basement is designed to be shown off – she rarely visits the space alone and instead uses it to host parties throughout the year. Other people, however, create their basement worlds to be private retreats from everyday life. “We’re so connected with our phones and with social media, that it’s very hard to escape from all the negativity,” Shron says. “To build this space shows a tremendous amount of drive and passion – and then you can escape to that and say, ‘I deal with the real world for 10, 12 hours a day, now I’m going to go for half an hour with a Scotch. I’m going to sit in this world that I’ve created.”Sam Gosling is a social psychologist at the University of Texas and author of Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You. Gosling’s book theorises that we leave “traces of ourselves” in the spaces we create, and these traces are insights into our personality. Gosling says there are three mechanisms connecting us to our spaces. The first, “identity claims”, are the deliberate things we do to communicate our selfhood: posters of our favourite movie on the wall, record players with select records left in prominent positions, bumper stickers on our cars. The second mechanism is also deliberate but less communicative – our homes feature sentimental items designed to remind ourselves of certain memories that may be obscure to others (I, for example, have a personalised rock on my desk from a friend’s wedding). The third mechanism is “residue” – the accidental stuff that communicates who we are, like a messy desk scattered with old coffee cups and crumpled paper.Gosling says basement worlds are simply a more extreme version of the spaces we all create. “A lot of people have a sewing room, a studio, a garden shed or a workshop,” he says. “The justification and rationale for this is: ‘Oh, I’m going out to fix the lawnmower.’ But actually it’s about having your space that’s under your control.” Gosling says these spaces help us to foster our identity, thoughts and feelings. But when asked why some people might be happy to project their identity on to their environment with a simple framed picture of a train, while others build an entire train in their basement, he confesses, “I don’t know.”Travis Larson is a 46-year-old construction estimator from Utah who has an unofficial Disneyland in his basement. His replica is strikingly accurate – he spent years photographing walls, lights, mouldings and columns in the theme park in order to recreate every detail. He has a simple answer to the question that stumped Gosling. “Well, it’s kind of my personality,” he says, when asked why he went to such extreme lengths.Larson says he has always been “detail orientated” and has “always liked things that are a little on the different side”. Surprisingly, he’s not a Disney obsessive – he first went to the park aged five, and he takes his three daughters every couple of years. “Having Disney in my basement I guess kind of satisfies that desire a little bit. So you can go a little bit longer without having to go there.”The reason Larson chose to recreate Disneyland is because he wanted to do something unique – he considered a pirate theme or a vintage town, but landed on Disney for his daughters. He started making the basement in 2004 and finished it 12 years later. By repurposing materials frugally, he estimates he spent no more than $5,000 on the whole thing. The space features paving stones, railings, park benches and the exteriors of iconic Disney rides such as Snow White’s Scary Adventures. Doors, lamps and windows are extremely detailed and intricate – Larson’s replica of a Disney restaurant even features the same curtain rods used in the park. Like Shron, he also added sound effects – the same music that plays in the parks can be heard in the basement, and he occasionally lights a scented candle to replicate the smell of sweet treats. “I had a mould of bricks and I made probably hundreds of them,” Larson says of his handiwork. “It was extremely time-consuming.”What, exactly, is the purpose of a private basement universe? Shron uses his train as a home office and also meditates in the space every morning (he has to turn off the horn sounds). Two of Larson’s daughters have bedrooms in his Disneyland, and he has a workshop down there. Both men say the spaces were an unexpected relief during lockdown.Like Shron, Larson sees his space as an “escape”, and both men admit – as Gosling theorised – that they enjoy having a space under their personal control. “Watching a movie or reading a book, that’s one thing,” Larson says. “But it’s different to have a physical location that you can escape to – especially someplace that you know is private or that you kind of control so that way you can make it as magical as you want.” Larson argues that while films and books are mentally immersive, his space is “a physical escape as well as a mental escape”.A creative personality, expendable income and a lot of determination are common denominators in those who create basement worlds – Shron describes himself as “very much a hardcore nerd”. Yet you may have also noticed that these spaces are extremely nostalgic – vintage villages, 1970s trains and the original Disney park all embody pleasant memories of times gone by. Krystine Batcho is a psychology professor at Le Moyne College who invented the Nostalgia Inventory, a survey that measures personal nostalgia. “There is a purity about childhood that we can never truly experience again in adulthood,” she says. “The phenomenon of actualising a fantasy land within our mundane reality reflects the indulgence of a nostalgic desire for imagination and fantasy.” She adds that in a social climate of uncertainty and conflict, nostalgia can comfort us and connect us to a more secure past.But why basements? Gosling argues that because those who build these worlds have families with a variety of needs, they can only use redundant, extra space for these projects. There is also a fun element of secrecy and surprise. “In the town that I live in, the exteriors of the houses are all very traditional,” says Burns, owner of the village basement. “You can still have a regular house that doesn’t look weird, and then once you go down those stairs and go to the basement level, it’s a whole new world. It’s fantasy – and it’s whatever you want it to be.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c23b926e6ddbe208c94cef2cbf3b406f8308fe9/0_249_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=976328ec1ddf36e26202f6f5e09345b8","title":"imagine using liquid water why people water their house plants with ice cubes","story":"Often touted as an easy solution to overwatering, the practice of placing ice cubes in orchids has become a ‘comedy horticultural moment’One piece of houseplant folklore resurfaces from time to time: that we should water our plants with ice cubes.For years everything from Reader’s Digest to Reddit offered up ice cubes as the trick to keeping potted friends alive. Recently the theory has returned thanks to a pair of meme pages.The Instagram accounts planty hoes and oops_i_wet_my_plants have been facilitating, as one commenter put it, a “comedy horticultural moment” with posts debating the efficacy of watering with ice cubes. In the comments, some followers swear they have a grandmother or old family friend who has successfully been raising orchids using ice cubes for decades.She thinks the current millennial and generation Z embrace of house plants has something to do with its comeback: “People are jumping on the trend now because everybody’s collecting indoor plants and a lot of people have either killed them, or want an easy solution to watering.”It’s not hard to kill a plant – death by overwatering is particularly common as excess water can pool down the bottom of pots and lead to root rot. Proponents of the cube theory think that ice gives the plant time to slowly absorb water as it melts. It’s not an unsubstantiated idea: in 2017, researchers at Ohio State University studying the use of ice cubes to water orchids found the practice had “no detrimental effects”.But experts today say it’s not a good approach. “I wouldn’t recommend it,” Lauren Camilleri from Leaf Supply, an online plant delivery business, tells  Australia.For one thing, the ice cubes could still waterlog your plant if they melt faster than they can be absorbed, she says. But most importantly, the extreme temperature of ice could send your plant into shock – killing it.“When we bring plants inside, what we’re trying to do is mimic their natural environment as much as possible in terms of light and the way we water them,” she says. “A lot of the plants that do well indoors are tropical plants – they come from the rainforest. So the water they’re getting in nature definitely isn’t going to be overly cold or overly hot.”Many of the Instagram memes centre around a specific plant: orchids. Are the rules different for them, or are people just looking for an easy solution to caring for a plant that’s notoriously difficult to keep alive?“Definitely the latter,” says Huynh. “People treat orchids as quite delicate things. But really, all you need to do when you water orchids is put them over the sink, pour water over them until it runs out of the bottom and then let the plant drain completely before putting it back.”No matter what plant you’re raising, there’s no exact formula for how much and how often it will need to be watered. Your best bet, Huynh says, is to feel the soil and only water once the top few centimetres is completely dry. It’s a little more complicated than just chucking a few ice cubes in the pot, but it works."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f37e51f606ebe7dc66de075ab470ff414822fb/0_137_3579_2148/master/3579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8fac7795af3e501f936f5f0b609a65","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

The typical rent-to-own customer is a young, female, single parent, living in rented accommodation, and is almost exclusively from a low-income household receiving benefits, according to the Financial Inclusion Centre thinktank.Documents released after BrightHouse fell into administration in March show that while the company has temporarily halted interest and late fees and “increased flexibility” on payments, it was only offering its 140,000 rent-to-own customers an initial 28-day payment holiday. That is just a third of the breathing space recommended by the regulator.Documents also showed that the administrators at Grant Thornton have been focused on “maximising the value of the loan book collections” as they wind down the company’s operations and return money to its creditors, which critics say could pose a conflict of interest.Mick McAteer, a former FCA board member and co-founder of the Financial Inclusion Centre thinktank, said: “There is a potential conflict between the interests of the administrator – and those they represent – and the vulnerable customers who owe money to BrightHouse.“The way the options are being presented to customers runs the risk of vulnerable customers missing out the best option for their circumstances. It could also help the administrators recover more assets,” he added.BrightHouse appears to be taking advantage of a loophole in the FCA guidance, which says a firm should grant a payment deferral for three months “unless the firm determines (acting reasonably) that it is obviously not in the customer’s interests to do so”.However, the FCA would not confirm whether it would be taking any action. “We are continuing to work with Grant Thornton during this administration. We expect them and all lenders to offer each consumer appropriate support, which includes payment deferrals.”The FCA said BrightHouse could offer forms of support other than a payment deferral, but only if it was in the customer’s best interest. It said deferring payments for 12 weeks could put borrowers in a worse situation long-term.Grant Thornton confirmed there was no interest charge of any kind applied when customers were granted a payment holiday, though a break would extend the lifetime of the loan.But Sara Williams, a debt adviser and author of the Debt Camel blog, said BrightHouse had not treated customers fairly and often expected borrowers to resume normal payments after 28 days.“People on furlough have had a store manager turn up at their house. Some customers are being contacted several times a day. This is not how a responsible firm should behave when it knows a customer is in difficulty,” she said.“The FCA’s rules say that a lender should allow a customer in difficulties reasonable time and opportunity to repay – these apply even when a firm is in administration,” she added.Grant Thornton said BrightHouse had been engaging with customers after the initial 28-day holiday to see whether other forbearance options – including a further pay freeze – might be appropriate. “Having reviewed the FCA guidance … the joint administrators deemed the current measures in place for BrightHouse customers impacted by the coronavirus pandemic to be the most suitable in the circumstances.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72082ef32b76429492f43ac5866d72c286d1c52e/0_119_5120_3073/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e935cf373286b314f48970983a050bf0","title":"glastonbury festival aiming to return in june says emily eavis covid","story":"Co-organiser says she hopes event, cancelled this year due to Covid, will not be pushed back to autumnThe organisers of Glastonbury festival aim to have the event back in June 2021, Emily Eavis has said.The music festival’s founder, Michael Eavis, had previously said the fate of next year’s event was uncertain.Glastonbury was cancelled this year, on its 50th birthday, because of the coronavirus pandemic.Emily Eavis, who co-organises the festival, tweeted that they were hoping it would return in June – its usual month – and not be pushed back to the autumn.“For those who have been asking, we have no plans to move next year’s Glastonbury to September 2021. We’re still very much aiming for June,” she wrote.“We’ve moved our ticket resale back from October to April, because so few people have asked for a refund (next year’s festival remains sold out), meaning we don’t have enough tickets to resell.“Plus, we’ve extended the free cancellation deadline until the end of January.”Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar were set to headline the Pyramid Stage this year to celebrate the festival’s landmark anniversary.Michael Eavis previously told ITV News West Country they were “moving heaven and earth” to make sure the festival happened in 2021.“But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to happen. That’s just wishful thinking,” he said. “The only certainty I think is the year after, 2022, to be perfectly candid, so we might have to wait for two years maybe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9befbd4d601f668f1d14920d79f54af3309489dd/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a2919e3547b3fa7765ea3e5394673076 1400w","title":"scottish tory leader douglas ross would vote against uk import of chlorinated chicken from us","story":"Exclusive: Douglas Ross says ‘more work needed’ for UK-wide trade dealThe Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, has said he would vote against allowing UK imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef from the US in a post-Brexit trade deal.Ross said the UK government was listening to complaints from the National Farmers Union (NFU), which has a strong presence in his rural constituency of Moray and fears a US trade deal would threaten food standards.He said ministers in London also needed to refine their proposals on common rules for the UK’s “internal market” after the country leaves the EU single market next year. They want a mutual recognition scheme, under which quality standards in one part of the UK would automatically be accepted by all four governments.The Scottish and Welsh governments, backed by NFU Scotland and other business organisations, say that would force devolved parliaments to accept lower quality goods that breach their quality standards, potentially including US chicken and beef.Ross said the UK could not force the US to change its food quality laws in any trade deal, but “what we can do is to say we would not allow hormone-injected beef or chlorinated raw chicken in. Our standards can be as high as they’ve always been.”Asked if he would vote against allowing those products into the UK, he said: “Absolutely. We would need legislation … I would be in no doubt and have no hesitation in voting against any legislation which would allow those products into this country. That’s a categorical assurance.”Westminster had never voted to lower the UK’s food quality and safety standards and would automatically adopt all the EU regulations when the post-Brexit transitional arrangements end in January next year, he said.Holyrood will also acquire more than 100 new powers from the EU when the transition period ends, but ministers were still taking account of vociferous complaints about the problems with the UK government’s internal market plans, he said.“The NFU wants more reassurance on the common framework and there’s more work to be done on that,” he said. “There would be no point having the consultation if the government was just going to forge on ahead and pay no attention to what has been said.The Scottish Tories will publish plans on Monday for a programme of major infrastructure projects run jointly by the UK and Scottish governments, upgrading motorways and building new towns and industrial hubs.Appointed Scottish Tory leader after Jackson Carlaw resigned suddenly on 30 July, Ross defended his plan to remain MP for Moray if he wins a Scottish parliament seat in Holyrood elections in May next year.

Donald Trump wants to be able to announce the US has a vaccine before tthe presidential election on 3 November.A vaccine is vital to stopping the pandemic, but Prof Sir Richard Peto of Oxford University and an adviser to the World Health Organization, said the first vaccine would be bought and used all over the world even if it had low efficacy.Even if it protected only a minority of the population, it would be regarded as the standard by which later vaccines would be measured. That could even lead to inferior vaccines being approved, because they would not have to show that they were any better.“I think there’s a big rush, a somewhat nationalistic rush and also somewhat capitalistic rush as well, to be absolutely first to register a vaccine, and it will actually make it more difficult to evaluate other vaccines,” Peto said.“We do need a vaccine that works and we need it soon,” but “we really do need quite strong evidence of efficacy”.There is huge political and commercial momentum in the UK behind the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, which is ahead of most other contenders in the world. Trials are taking place in a number of countries, including those with high levels of infection, such as South Africa and Brazil, where how well it works will become clear more quickly .The Department of Health said on Friday that it planned to take emergency measures to ensure the UK could licence a vaccine this year if it had sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy. Until 31 December, the UK would otherwise have to wait for the European Medicines Agency to approve a vaccine. Next year, post-Brexit, the UK will license its own vaccines and drugs.In its consultation document on changing the law, the government says the UK’s joint committee on vaccines and immunisation (JCVI) will be responsible for recommending that a vaccine that should go forward for licensing. That committee is chaired by Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who has said they may have enough data to give to regulators before the end of the year.Peto is a member of the WHO’s Solidarity Vaccines Trial Expert Group, which is made up of leading scientists around the world who are advising on the establishment of the WHO’s trial to compare different vaccine candidates.The group said in the Lancet medical journal last week that a poor vaccine would be worse than no vaccine, not least because people who had it would assume they were no longer at risk and stop social distancing.“Deployment of a weakly effective vaccine could actually worsen the Covid-19 pandemic if authorities wrongly assume it causes a substantial reduction in risk, or if vaccinated iniduals wrongly believe they are immune, hence reducing implementation of, or compliance with, other Covid-19 control measures,” they said.The Lancet piece says trials such as Solidarity, which compare various vaccines, are a better way to proceed.“In comparison with inidual trials for each of the many different vaccines, a global multi-vaccine trial with a shared control group could provide more rapid and reliable results,” they write.“High enrolment rates facilitated by flexible trial design and hundreds of study sites in high-incidence locations could yield results on short-term efficacy for each vaccine within just a few months of including that vaccine.”Good results on safety and effectiveness do not guarantee there will be no long-term problems, they add. The vaccine’s protection may wane, for instance.“The trial costs will be a fraction of the societal costs of Covid-19, and this global collaboration could rebut detrimental vaccine nihilism and vaccine nationalism,” they write."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d0aab4894141062e23a3dcaee529ace234d2d29/0_190_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576fef8dcff8e6a73701b8dbe587fe6d","title":"four day working week could create 500k new jobs in uk study says","story":"Exclusive: thinktank says measure to mitigate unemployment during Covid-19 recession has precedents in both Europe and USA four-day week in the public sector would create up to half a million new jobs and help limit the rise in unemployment expected over the coming months, according to research by the progressive thinktank Autonomy.Amid concerns that the jobless total is set to rise sharply as the Treasury’s furlough scheme is wound down, the thinktank said the time was right for Rishi Sunak to pioneer a shorter working week.The Autonomy study represents the first attempt to quantify the jobs impact of a four-day week, with the thinktank saying it would be possible for public sector workers to go on to a 32-hour week with no loss of pay.It added that the scheme would cost between £5.4bn and £9bn a year and have the biggest impact in the “red wall” seats in the Midlands and the north of England captured by the Conservatives in the 2019 general election.More than 5 million people work in the public sector – about one in six of those in employment – but the report noted that in places such as Doncaster, Bradford and Barnsley the proportion rose to about one in five. London, which has a higher percentage of private sector employment would benefit less, the thinktank said.A government spokesperson said: “It is not for the government to mandate working patterns for businesses or their employees. The important thing is that they have the flexibility to agree a working pattern that suits them.“This also applies to the civil service and our commitment to flexible working is one of the reasons we consistently rank as one of the best employers in the UK.”Will Stronge, Autonomy’s research director, said: “The time has come for a four-day working week and the public sector should act as the pioneer for it, both as employer and as procurer of services.“To help tackle the unemployment crisis we are facing this winter, a four-day week is the best option for sharing work more equally across the economy and creating much needed new jobs.“The four-day week makes so much sense as it would boost productivity, create new jobs and make us all much happier and healthier.”The report said the public sector should test out the idea as it would reduce burnout, work-related poor mental health and drastically improve work-life balance. More than two-thirds of UK workers were stressed or overworked, the thinktank said.The report said the idea of a shorter working week had been tried in the past during periods of high unemployment.“The oft-cited example of President Roosevelt’s New Deal measures which reduced the working week to 40 hours maximum, is a case in point. Such a scheme is also not unprecedented in the UK: the first Thatcher government inherited and maintained a similar initiative during the 1979-1982 recession.“Nor is it merely an artefact from history: in Germany the tried and tested Kurzarbeit scheme was used during the 2008 financial crash to mitigate mass unemployment by subsidising a reduction and reallocation of labour, and has again been used during the Covid crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a071a558f07e3ee6d4e98ba35efa25f6c36b5f/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c945c33f5e1a9ab8118437ae020920","title":"calls to raise child benefit in uk to help struggling families","story":"Study finds growing number of families forced to spend benefit on household bills during coronavirus crisis A charity has called for the government to significantly increase child benefit after research found increasing number of families now use the payments to cover household necessities such as bills and day-to-day expenses.Currently, eligible families receive £21.05 a week for a first child, and £13.95 a week for any subsequent children. Those paid more than £60,000 a year do not get the benefit, and it is offset against tax for people earning between £50,000 and £60,000.The CPAG has called for the support to be increased by £10 a week, saying the government had so far offered no specific support for struggling families during the Covid-19 pandemic.The group’s chief executive, Alison Garnham said the coming week would see many parents “worrying about whether they’ve got enough money to meet their children’s needs as they face an exceptionally expensive post-lockdown return to school” – not least the cost of new shoes and uniforms.“In the period ahead, as the coronavirus recession takes hold, we are likely to see many more families falling into hardship and many more parents struggling to stop their children from slipping into poverty,” she said.“Yet there was nothing in the government’s economic response to the pandemic that offered ongoing targeted financial support for children.“For almost 50 years, child benefit has been there for children as a minimum protection against poverty but its value has been eroded and as our survey shows, hard-pressed parents are increasingly having to spend it on general household essentials. That isn’t right.“As a nation we invest in the state pension to support everyone in retirement, we should be investing just as much in child benefit to support all families with the extra costs of children. Re-investing in child benefit is the least we can do to shore up children’s life chances in these uncertain times.”A government spokeswoman said: “We are wholly committed to supporting the lowest-paid families in our country and have taken significant steps to support those on low incomes throughout this pandemic.“We have invested over £9.3bn more support through the welfare system, in addition to raising the living wage, ending the benefit freeze and increasing work incentives.

Jos Buttler was mentioned by name for his finishing ability, as were Jofra Archer and Mark Wood whose extra pace, the captain said, would be invaluable on the pancake pitches of the 2021 T20 World Cup in India.“If you have that extra pace you can still skid through someone, bowl a wide yorker or hit the stumps and get a wicket,” he said. “When you’re a little bit slower, that pace isn’t there and it’s difficult to skid through someone unless the ball is reverse swinging.”There was, however, no great T20 trumpets for Joe Root, who is expected to make the 50‑over squad but not the 20-over contingent, despite a quickfire 64 and a couple of wickets for Yorkshire in the Blast game against Derbyshire on Sunday.“We’re meeting this evening” was as good as it got from Morgan, who praised the batting of Tom Banton and Dawid Malan and the desire of members of the Test squad to return to the bubble so soon after the end of the Test series. “They do enjoy playing the white‑ball set-up so the fact that some of them want to come back and play is great, particularly after being in the biosecure environment for so long.”It all represents an overflowing of riches unknown to England white-ball teams of yore. As Michael Vaughan, working for BBC, sighed of his time as captain: “We were struggling to find five or six white-ball players.

Away sides have enjoyed more success since the restart with matches played in empty grounds and Gloucester had shed more tears than most at the absence of fans. The terrace from where insults are hurled at visiting players was draped with advertising banners, one of which advised readers to drive their ambition.The goal for Gloucester amounts to a place in next season’s European Champions Cup after another campaign that too often has been about the lowest common denominator, moments of brilliance eclipsed by a lack of concentration and basic errors, a failing it will take their new head coach, George Skivington, more than a few weeks to repair.They were at their swaggering best in the first half after Zack Henry gave Leicester an early lead with a penalty. Joe Simpson scored their first try, supporting Chris Harris, who broke the line too easily, and it was quickly followed by Thorley’s first after Jonny May’s incursion into midfield and Billy Twelvetrees’s dummy run flummoxed the defence.Henry’s second penalty reversed the flow, but not for long. Thorley’s second came after he came off his wing and waited for Cipriani to open the defence by delaying his pass until the final moment, and his hat-trick, and bonus point try, was created by Jason Woodward, whose chip to the line exposed an overstretched defence.Thorley’s fourth was the most eye-catching. He received the ball on his own 10-metre line with his opposite number Jordan Olowofela lured off his wing by his uncertainty over whether Woodward would run or pass. It gave Thorley time to get into a gallop and when he confronted Henry in Leicester’s 22 he barely felt the impact as he made it to the line without interrupting his stride.Leicester’s head coach, Steve Borthwick, summoned Ford and, at the interval, Youngs and the powerful No 8 Jordan Taufua. The match turned as the Tigers scored 24 unanswered points. Harry Potter finished Henry’s break five minutes before the interval and Youngs and Ford dictated the tempo after it, forcing penalties from the home side and exerting pressure.Tries from Taufua and another forward replacement, Cameron Henderson, both of whom ploughed through the less bulky Twelvetrees, were followed by a Ford penalty after Jake Polledri infringed at a breakdown. Leicester were only six points behind and Gloucester, who had lost Cipriani to a knee injury, were slipping to an ignominious defeatThey cleared their heads just in time, driving around the fringes and accumulating penalties. Twelvetrees kicked one to give them a cushion and then Lloyd Evans, Cipriani’s replacement, glided through a tired defence to seal victory and consolidate their hold on eighth place.Leicester may have left empty handed, but they could take the most from the game.“We gave Gloucester a lot of respect and were staring down the barrel of a massive defeat,” said Geordan Murphy, Leicester’s director of rugby. “Then we started to play and caused them problems to the point where the game was in the balance near the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd2597978f0cd9fb28f14481d3ea4c86a34b88d6/145_543_3678_2207/master/3678.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=47c667d9db0b3263dbc38bf5c83b088d","title":"julian alaphilippe back in yellow after stage two of the tour de france","story":"Julian Alaphilippe dispelled any lingering gloom hanging over the Grand Depart of the 2020 Tour de France by speeding to victory and the race leader’s yellow jersey in the 186 kilometre second stage to the Promenade des Anglais, in Nice.The hugely popular French rider, who led the Tour for 14 days in 2019, slumped on the ground in tears and dedicated victory to his father, who died in June, after narrowly outsprinting Marc Hirschi of Switzerland and Britain’s resurgent Adam Yates.“It’s always special to win on the Tour, but this is a special year,” Alaphilippe said. “It’s been a really difficult year for me. I just want to dedicate this victory to my dad.”A mountainous stage through the Alpes-Maritimes burst into life on the short final climb, the Col des Quatre Chemins, a minnow compared to the giant ascents of the Colmiane and Turini tackled earlier in the day, but with gradients ideally suited to Alaphilippe’s trademark punchy accelerations.When the Frenchman attacked on the steepest sections, only the little-known Hirschi and a surprisingly rapid Yates could follow. Yates led over the top and the trio then worked together to distance the pursuing peloton as they sped back down the corniche roads to the Nice seafront.“I’d asked the team to make it hard in the finale and that’s what we did,” the French rider said. “There were not many riders left on the last climb.”But neither Hirschi nor Yates had an adequate answer to Alaphilippe’s finishing burst and, with the peloton hot on their heels and closing fast, the 28-year-old opened up his sprint and powered across the line and into the Tour leader’s maillot jaune.“The others tried to play with my nerves a little bit,” Alaphilippe said, “but in the end Yates worked well. There was a strong headwind, but we couldn’t miss our chance. Winning made me feel good, I’ve missed it.”Yates, who suffered a bout of sickness before the Tour started, had, like Alaphilippe, spoken only of seeking stage wins, but such was his climbing speed in pursuit of Alaphilippe that his team’s expectations may now be heightened. After such a performance, both riders will surely be reassessing their goals.“I came across to Alaphilippe and Hirschi and then we started working on the descent,” Yates, now second overall, said. “In the end I was never going to win the sprint , those too were both faster than me , but to come third on stage two, I’m pretty happy with that. Maybe if there had been another climb, but in a sprint on this kind of finish, I was always going to end up second or third. All in all, it was a good day.”The peloton left the start line in Nice with the majority of riders swathed in bandages. There were three non‑starters: Philippe Gilbert, of Belgium, his teammate and 2018 stage winner, John Degenkolb, and Rafael Valls, of Mikel Landa’s Bahrain McLaren team, all of whom were victims of crashes during Saturday’s chaotic first stage.Others, meanwhile, including Thibaut Pinot of France, Pavel Sivakov, of the Ineos Grenadiers, and Nairo Quintana, of Colombia, were the pedalling wounded, as they did their best to shrug off the pain caused by their crashes the previous day. “It hurts all over,” Pinot said before the start.The day’s seven-man breakaway, which included perennial green jersey wearer, Peter Sagan, established itself well before the first main climb of the Col de la Colmiane, but with the peloton only allowing them a short leash it was inevitable that the group would be reeled in.Just as they had in Saturday’s chaotic conditions, the Jumbo-Visma team of Primoz Roglic assumed control and led the main field up the next ascent, first category Col de Turini, with the Ineos Grenadiers of defending Tour champion, Egan Bernal, seemingly happy to take a back seat. The pace was high enough though to shed overnight race leader and stage one winner, Alexander Kristoff, with 90km still to race.But the stage truly came to life on the Col des Quatre Chemins, where Alaphilippe put in his decisive attack. That sudden explosion of speed provoked a degree of panic that saw Roglic’s teammate Tom Dumoulin take an unexpected tumble and Bernal’s team suddenly move to the front of the peloton.A mass pursuit, on the descent back to Nice seafront, initiated by Bernal’s team and followed by most of the leading favourites, could not prevent the French rider taking the stage win and the coveted yellow jersey. Any pretence then, after last year’s swashbuckling performance, that Alaphilippe would settle merely for stage wins, rather than targeting overall victory, has already evaporated.“I gave everything,” Alaphilippe said of his typically dramatic stage win. “I had nothing to lose. It’s something special to be in yellow in the Tour, so we will defend it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/459f7de2f24abe78e220d8d8c305ba9dbfa11e94/117_2_3129_1878/master/3129.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b1aeeb14512068a167efe5e8c047f6fc","title":"this isnt the 1990s apple under pressure from app developers","story":"Facebook, Amazon and Google all have their problems, but Apple is losing friends fasterFacebook may be the home of international conspiracy theories, Amazon the bane of high streets everywhere and Google slowly tightening its grip on the entire web but it is Apple that is rapidly becoming the most friendless of the big tech companies.Even its attempts to make new allies are starting to come back to bite.The company’s rigid control of the iPhone App Store, long a source of friction for developers large and small, became a battleground over the summer, as Apple began to tighten policies requiring developers to pay the company a cut of commerce on the store.“We thought we knew all the written and unwritten rules,” David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Hey’s developer, Basecamp, told the . “But then we, with all this knowledge … can be a victim of their capricious policies. If they kick you out of the App Store, it’s like you don’t exist.”Just as that standoff thawed, with Hey agreeing to build features for users without a subscription, another, noisier conflict started, with Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite. That fight, still ongoing, resulted in Epic introducing its own payment processing into Fortnite, breaking Apple’s rules in the process. Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store Epic sued, alleging abuse of monopoly.But even when Apple tries to make friends, the company has found itself ing into new conflicts. In April, Amazon made a surprising announcement: Amazon Prime customers would be able to buy streaming movies and TV shows on iOS using the credit card they have saved on file.At first glance, the move appeared to be exactly the same switch that would later lead to Epic being unceremoniously expelled from the store but, Apple revealed, it was actually a sweetheart deal: “premium” video apps were allowed to use their own payment systems, in exchange for supporting the company’s troubled Apple TV hardware.Now others want the same deal. Digital Content Next, a trade organisation representing some of the largest US news organisations including the New York Times and the Washington Post, has written to Apple asking the company to offer the same freedom to its own members.“Nearly all of DCN’s members offer apps in the Apple App Store and … many offer subscription-based access to a wide variety of content,” wrote Jason Kint, the organisation’s chief executive. “The terms of Apple’s unique marketplace greatly impact the ability to continue to invest in high-quality, trusted news and entertainment particularly in competition with other larger firms.“I ask that you clearly define the conditions that Amazon satisfied for its arrangement so that DCN’s member companies meeting those conditions can be offered the same agreement,” Kint’s letter concluded.The push to offer special deals to inidual developers may allow the largest companies to thrive on the App Store but risks undercutting Apple’s favourite defence of its model: that it underpins the broad-based success of the “app economy”.In June, citing a study commissioned by the company and carried out by Analysis Group, Apple claimed “the App Store ecosystem supported $519bn in billings and sales globally in 2019 alone”.“If that is the outcome of this summer of App Store turmoil, it will be a win for everyone: developers, Apple and the users that want both security and innovation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb61533a1e0d0cb1221b6e9478c757214779588/0_288_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f9a7db84cbb29222bf7d5377cdd6a661","title":"child 3 catches in kite strings and is lifted high into air in taiwan","story":"Girl became entangled in tail of giant kite at festival and was rescued unharmedA three-year-old girl in Taiwan was caught up in the strings of a kite and lifted high into the air in front of horrified onlookers before being rescued unharmed.The unidentified girl was taking part in a kite festival on Sunday in the seaside town of Nanliao when she became entangled in a giant, long-tailed orange kite and was hoisted off the ground by several metres.Video shot at the scene showed her twisting several times above a crowd of adults who struggled to pull the kite back to earth.News reports said the girl was frightened but suffered no physical injuries.

The health risk posed to children by Covid-19 was extremely low, he said.School leaders who spoke to the , however, described desperately shuffling budgets, sidelining projects and plans and making do with a fraction of what was required.Paul Gosling of Exeter Road community primary school in Devon said he would have ideally liked to have had a cleaner on site from this week to cover shared spaces, but it would have cost £15,000 at a school whose budget may only just balance by the end of the year after many years of cuts.“I cannot plan to have a cleaner on site if I have no idea if I will be able to claim against the fund, so I am balancing safety against financial stability,” he said.The government’s coronavirus schools fund, which was introduced to cover the exceptional costs associated with the pandemic, closed on 21 July. A notice on its website says there are plans to open a “second claims window” in the autumn.Simon Kidwell, the headteacher at Hartford Manor primary school and nursery in Cheshire said he needed to find £50,000 to cover costs. This was after spending £16,000 to make the school “covid secure,” including £11,500 for the installation of 37 hand-washing stations. Losses included £7,000 in nursery fees, £21,000 for before and after-school care and a £10,000 decline in fundraising because of cancelled events.“The government say that the full opening of schools is their number one priority, however, there are no plans to support schools with additional Covid-related costs for the new academic year,” he said.Rebecca Poole, the headteacher at Hampton High in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames, said: “Our funding is really tight. Our business manager has had to cut back on other parts of our school budget and it was really only because we felt it was an absolute priority and other things will have to be sidelined.“We’ve earmarked £10,000 for laptops needed for remote learning after our IT manager negotiated some deals, but it’s really tricky. I know every budget line and it is literally about taking £500 from one budget line into another to pay. There will be things that we won’t be able to invest in.”NASUWT teachers described budgetary constraints that mean special wipes to clean desks, chairs and other surfaces are already being abandoned and replaced with improvised solutions. Others spoke of problems for schools already in debt getting worse, the burden of having to invest in more IT to prepare for remote learning and costs such as hiring more teachers for smaller classes.“Schools are facing significant additional costs in terms of the provision of PPE, additional cleaning regimes, signage and in supporting changes to the school day. These are not one-off costs but will be additional expenditure that schools will need to continue to find from their budgets while Covid-19 remains in circulation,” said Dr Patrick Roach, the NASUWT’s general secretary.“Many of our members have voiced their concerns to us that their schools will struggle to meet these costs, particularly in the context of years of cuts to education budgets. Schools need to be assured that they will be provided with the additional financial and practical resources they need to remain open without cutting corners on safety.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Headteachers, teachers and school staff have gone to enormous lengths to ensure children can get back into their classes safely when the new term starts as it is the best place for their education, development and wellbeing.“Throughout the pandemic, schools have continued to receive their core funding, with this year marking the first year of a three-year £14.4bn total cash boost. Schools have also been able to claim for specific exceptional costs such as additional cleaning required due to confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases, worth up to £75,000 for large secondary schools.”The department said that schools had been eligible to claim for costs incurred between March and July as a result of pressures such as increases associated with keeping schools open over the Easter and summer half term holidays and providing free school meals for eligible children who are not in school.The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said: “If schools are not given additional resources then children across the country will foot the bill, with resources that should fund their education instead paying for public health measures because the government refuse to do so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cb406b363efd9396ca15d028084efbfc4c2548b/0_128_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9a974ece558cf7d4d9986734870dbc04","title":"coronavirus live news us infections near 6m uk records highest cases since june","story":"Private tuition centres shut for the first time and traffic was lighter in South Korea’s capital on Monday, the first working day of tighter social-distancing rules designed to halt a second wave of coronavirus outbreaks, Reuters reports.South Korea took the unprecedented step on Friday to restrict the operation of restaurants, coffee shops and so-called cram schools in the Seoul metropolitan area, with churches, nightclubs and most public schools having already been closed.Fewer cars and people were on the streets of Seoul during the morning rush hours as more companies encouraged employees to work from home.Private after-school tuition academies, which operated as usual in March during South Korea’s first wave of coronavirus infections, were shuttered. There are 25,000 cram schools in Seoul and nationally three out of four children – from grade 1 to grade 12 – attended such classes.The government has cut staffing at public offices, while many corporations, including tech giants Samsung Electronics, LG and SK Hynix, have expanded or reinstated work-from-home policies.Onsite dining at restaurants, pubs and bakeries in the Seoul area are banned after 9 p.m. until Sunday, while coffeehouse chains are restricted to takeout and delivery.South Korea has reported total infections of 19,947 and 324 deaths from Covid-19.Earlier we reported the Times of India saying the country had passed 80,000 new infections for the first time, which would be a national and global record. However the figure on the Indian government website now says 78,512. Reuters news agency is also reporting the lower figure.On Sunday, India’s total of 78,761 new cases exceeded the previous record of 77,299 in the United States in mid July.At 3.62m total cases, India is fast catching up to these two countries in terms of cumulative caseload, but it has relatively lower death rate.India’s deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, went up by 971 in the past 24 hours, taking the tally to 64,469, the health ministry said. Japan has recorded 600 new coronavirus cases, as new cases continue to decline from the recent peak of 1,605 on 7 August. The seven-day average for new cases is 757. In South Korea, new infections have stayed under 200 for a second day in a row, Yonhap reports. The country reported 248 cases on Monday, including 238 local infections, and 299 cases on Sunday. This likely reflects lower testing on a weekend.In Australia’s worst-affected state, Victoria, the premier Daniel Andrews is preparing to outline an exit strategy for the state’s tough lockdowns, which have become a major flashpoint with Australia’s federal government.Victoria logged 73 new cases on Monday, the lowest daily increase since early July.It also recorded another 41 deaths but only eight occurred in the previous 24 hours.The remaining 33 were added to the tally after being reported to the health department.The national coronavirus death toll stands at 652.The Victorian premier will outline a plan to ease social and business restrictions on 6 September.“It is too early today to settle that road map and to lock that in,” Andrews told reporters.“Another week’s data is critically important to make sure the strategy continues to work.”Victoria’s restrictions are dragging down the national economy and the federal government has been pushing the state to re-open more quickly.Melbourne’s six-week stage four restrictions - including a nightly curfew - are due to end on 13 September.But Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth said “it’s hard to see that happening”.“I think the numbers need to be a lot less than they are now.”Coatsworth compared the state to NSW and Queensland, which are recording fewer than 10 new daily cases.And now, for something completely different...Lady Gaga wore a staggering array of masks at MTV Video Music awards, at which she won five awards.Did not think she would crop up during this coronavirus coverage, but there you go.

Here’s some more on New Zealand’s nine new cases from our reporter Charles Anderson:There are nine new cases of Covid-19 in Auckland as the city moves out of lockdown and allows travel throughout the country.It has been almost three weeks since Auckland moved to Alert Level 3, which shuttered schools and many businesses.However, now Auckland is now at Level 2.5, while the rest of the country remains at Level 2. That means Aucklanders have harsher restrictions, with gatherings capped at 10 people and authorised funerals and tangihanga at 50. From today, masks are also mandatory across the country on public transport and planes for everyone over 12.All of the new Covid-19 cases are linked to the original Auckland cluster which sparked the lockdown. There are 11 people with Covid-19 in hospital with a total confirmed case number of 1387.These new cases come as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern managed fall out from wrong advice coming from the Ministry of Health which suggested all people in South and west Auckland should get Covid-19 tests.She said she was “incredibly angry” at the communication breakdown saying from only ministers should be relied upon to deliver “significant” Covid-19 updates – not the ministry’s website.Ardern yesterday also asked New Zealanders not to leave their homes without wearing a mask.“We know masks protect you and the people around you,” she said. “They limit the chance of Covid-19 spreading in places where it is often harder to distance yourself and to trace people.”Health and education minister Chris Hipkins said to parents who might be concerned about sending children back to school: “Do get your kids back in school. Their futures depend on this.”The move to Level 2.5 comes as some experts say that they would have preferred Auckland to stay longer in Level 3 to ensure the cluster was contained.Otago University epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker said it was up to Aucklanders to stick to the rules, use contract tracing apps and get tested if they had symptoms, if they wanted the virus to be brought under control.Yesterday there were two new community cases in New Zealand, one of them a doctor in Tokoroa.France’s education minister acknowledged on Sunday that not all of the country’s schools can safely reopen Tuesday.With several thousand new infections now reported in France every day, Jean-Michel Blanquer told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper that some classes will remain closed when the nationwide reopening begins, but as few as possible.French doctors published an appeal Saturday saying that the government’s anti-virus measures for schools aren’t strict enough. They urged masks for children as young as six and a mix of online and in-person schooling. Spain announced last week that children would be required to wear masks at school from six. Currently French schools are set to resume largely as normal, but with masks required all day for everyone 11 and over and some restrictions on movements and gatherings. Just back to Australia and there are 10 new cases of Covid in the most populous state of New South Wales. Somewhat reassuringly, six of those are in quarantine. All four locally acquired cases are linked to a cluster in the centre of Sydney. The premier of the state, Gladys Berejiklian, asks people to consider their movements as the weather warms up. Today is the last day of winter and I’m pleased we got through the winter months as well as we did, and now that the warmer weather is upon us can I please ask everybody to think about their activities when they’re out of doors ... just make sure you keep your social distance.She says August and September are normally peak times for flu, but people should assume that if they are sick, it’s Covid. Normally August-September is the peak time for the flu but because we’re hand sanitising and keeping our distances those numbers haven’t materialised, but that means if you do have a symptom you should assume it’s Covid and not the flu.You can stay across all of Australia’s coronavirus news on the Australian blog below:New Zealand has reported five new community cases of transmission of Covid-19, and four in managed isolation. All of the new community cases are linked to the Auckland cluster. The city has now moved down to alert level 2, with extra restrictions, including wearing face masks on public transport. Gatherings within the Auckland region may involve a maximum of 10 people.China has reported 17 new Covid-19 cases, up from 9 reported a day earlier, the country’s health authority said on Monday.The National Health Commission said all of the new cases were imported infections involving travellers returning from abroad, marking the 15th straight day of no local infections for the country.The number of asymptomatic cases rose to 19 from 4 reported a day earlier. China’s total number of COVID-19 infections now stands at 85,048, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.

Photograph: David JonesPA Wire Leaving Cert students are set to receive fresh details this week over how the calculated grades process has been adjusted to try to make results as fair and accurate as possible. The Department of Education is expected to this week release technical details of how the calculated grades system has been completed and refined in light of expert advice and controversy in the United Kingdom. Disadvantaged students were found to have been disproportionately downgraded compared to others in the UK system, which led to an outcry and a government U-turn to reinstate teachers’ predicted grades.Sources say the Irish system now differs from the UK version in at least three crucial respects.Teachers’ estimated marks for inidual students will carry a much greater weight in the Irish system compared to the UK, it is understood.In addition, teachers’ estimated marks for inidual students will carry a much greater weight in the Irish system compared to the UK.National performanceFurthermore, it is claimed that the Irish system is designed to allow for exceptional students to be recognised, even in a class or school which has historically underperformed.Calculated grades – which replaced the summer Leaving Cert exams – are based on a combination of teachers’ estimated marks for students and a standardisation process to ensure the national performance is similar to previous years. Some 61,000 students are due to receive their results at 9am on Monday, September 7th.The new details of how the system will operate is unlikely to satisfy opposition parties who have criticised an element of the standardisation process know as “school profiling” .This is a reference to how historical data for student achievement across inidual schools is set to form part of the standardisation process.Labour’s education spokesman Aodhán Ó Ríordáin TD said this element should be taken out of the process as it threatens to “doubly disadvantage” students from less well-off backgrounds.Department sources, however, say the Irish system has been carefully constructed to ensure students are not unfairly disadvantaged on socio-economic grounds.It is understood that the calculated grades process, meanwhile, is largely complete and verification checks are taking place.Students, who receive their results next Monday, will have to wait four days after their results to receive CAO officers.Some education sources say the fact that our college offers system is different to the UK’s may take some of the heat out of controversy linked to students’ calculated grades.In the UK, students received conditional college offers based on their predicted grades. However, in Ireland the CAO operates on the basis of supply and demand, along with students’ relative performance, which should provide more flexibility for movements in grades.

Photograph: John GilesPA Wire The annual winter shrouding of Dublin with thick smog – grimly accepted by most as an inevitability – not only reduced natural light but led to the premature death of hundreds of people.The State eventually admitted parts of the capital were exceeding EU smog limits, often for days in a row, and decided to introduce a programme to get rid of open fireplaces in the worst-affected areas. But a young politician who had been appointed minister of state with responsibility for environmental protection boldly rejected this plan, which would take 20 years to complete at a cost of some €500 million. Looking back, Mary Harney says the government approach was to survey “special control areas” with persistent smog – Ballyfermot was the first of them – and provide grants to remove fireplaces. “I didn’t buy into that,” she says. “The obvious thing to do was to ban coal but not to criminalise householders.”And so in September 1990, a prohibition on bituminous or “smoky” coal was introduced. With an emphasis on the industry rather than the consumer, it banned the sale, distribution and marketing of smoky coal, rather than the burning of it.Flynn had previously rejected a ban, claiming it would hurt widows and old-age pensioners. In November 1988 Flynn had outlined in the Dáil what was being done to tackle Dublin’s growing smog problem. Then Fine Gael TD Alan Shatter said he was not satisfied his declaration was “pressing the matter”. “If necessary, bring in emergency legislation,” Shatter urged, adding he would get the support of TDs in doing so. “Smog has been around a long time and I am the first person who tried to do something about it,” Flynn replied. “Just like I solved the problem of fish kills, I will solve this too.”Two factors were critical to getting the ban across the line, Harney says. Despite being within the ranks of the junior partner in the coalition government formed in 1989, she “roped in” the support of taoiseach Charlie Haughey. “I have always given him credit for that,” says Harney. Secondly, a junior minister had, for the first time, been given “delegated powers” in her case responsibility for environmental protection including the EPA. “That was great.”Ban extendedThe ban resulted in air pollution levels falling by 70 per cent and, since then, it has been estimated that 8,000 fewer people have died from heart and lung-related diseases. It proved immediately effective in reducing smoke and sulphur dioxide levels, and was gradually extended to other areas. From September 1st, 2020, the ban will be extended to all cities and towns with a population of more than 10,000, meaning half the population of the State will live within the geographic scope of existing restrictions on bituminous coal and other specified fuel, such as low smoke zones.Over the 30 years since the ban was introduced, the science of air pollution has become much more robust, with indications that the threat to human health had previously been grossly underestimated. Air pollution is now estimated to cost the Irish economy about €2 billion per year when burden on the health service and lost productivity are factored in. The greatest health risks are associated with tiny solid particles that float in the air, known as particulate matter (PM), that are classified by size – ie being of less than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter. PM10 (about 10th of the width of a human hair) can be seen as smoke or haze while PM2.5 (tiny “nanoparticles”) are invisible to the human eye. PM10s are easily filtered out by the body’s natural defences such as nose hair, but PM2.5 nanoparticles are capable of penetrating deep into lung passageways and entering the bloodstream causing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory impacts. In children and adults, both short- and long-term exposure to air pollution can lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma.Burning solid fuels – coal, peat and wood – in the home is by far the largest contributor to Irish emissions.National estimates indicate smoky fuels are a key source of PM2.5 nanoparticles. They are responsible for about 60 per cent of all emissions, yet provide less than 5 per cent of national energy demand. ‘No-brainer’Three decades on, Harney expresses incredulity that smoky coal is still being burned in many parts of Ireland, when a nationwide ban is “a no-brainer”.She admits her strategy was high-risk and succeeded with luck. Every coal merchant was up in arms, though the ban had its supporters – notably within the medical profession and especially Prof Luke Clancy of St James’s Hospital. Crucially, it worked from “a public health, science and timing point of view”, she believes. Flynn declined to comment when asked by The  for his views on the ban. Undoubtedly, he was under sustained pressure from the coal lobby when he opposed it. However, it should be acknowledged he brought in the 1987 Air Pollution Act, the first comprehensive piece of legislation to deal with air quality in Ireland. Furthermore, as EU commissioner in charge of public health, he did his bit in curbing the impacts of another notorious form of air pollution – tobacco smoke – when a directive to gradually phase out almost all tobacco advertising and sponsorship was adopted in 1998 under his stewardship. Despite the successes of the ban, air pollution is still a major public health issue. “Improving air quality will benefit our health and the health of the planet,” says Dr Claire Noone of NUIG Centre for Climate and Air Pollution Studies . “By reducing biomass burning encouraging cyclingwalking, using public transport and transiting to electric vehicles, we can all make a difference.” In Ireland, 380,000 people have asthma and 890,000 people will suffer from the condition at some stage of their lives, according to Emily Blennerhassett, interim chief executive of the Asthma Society of Ireland. “Air pollution can severely impact their quality of life by triggering asthma symptoms and studies have shown it can cause asthma in young children,” she says.She says former minister for environment Richard Bruton expressed legal concerns that would limit the Government’s ability to introduce a nationwide smoky coal ban. So the society worked with UCC’s Environmental Law Society to examine legal options open to the Government “to ensure plans for a nationwide smoky coal ban can be expanded to include all smoky fuels, in a bid to protect the health of the Irish people”.She believes a broader ban to include peat and wet wood has the best chance of avoiding legal challenge by coal importers or of falling foul of EU law. Moreover, “a ban on the use of smoky fuels would greatly impact not just people living with respiratory conditions such as asthma, but would be extremely beneficial to the health of the general public”. The Asthma Society of Ireland has issued a report which argues the current enforcement regime is hampered by issues of “leakage” with prohibited fuels being used in low smoke zones migration of air pollution abuse of fuel labelling and a below target regime of solid fuel inspections by local authorities. It suggests a nationwide smoky fuel ban is justified on health and climate grounds, while protecting “the right of Ireland’s residents to clean air”.Over the coming weeks, Oireachtas members and the relevant State bodies will be briefed on its findings. There is unfinished business in ensuring the State’s citizens can breathe air that is not going to shorten their lives."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: US National Institutes of Health via APThe rate of new coronavirus infections in Northern Ireland is now “significantly higher” than in the Republic of Ireland or the UK as a whole, the North’s chief scientific officer has warned. On Friday the number of cases per 100,000 in Northern Ireland over 14 days was 38.6, according to Prof Ian Young, compared with the European Centre for Disease Control’s figure of 31.1 in the Republic and 23.2 in the UK. Prof Young told The  he did not have a “simple explanation” for the increased infection rate in the North, which had performed “much better” than the rest of the UK earlier in the pandemic. “In particular, I don’t know whether our population are adhering less well to restrictions than the population in England, Scotland and Wales, which is the obvious thing to think about, but it’s very hard to get accurate comparative data.” However, while the North’s figures were currently higher than those in the Republic, he said the numbers fluctuated and the outbreaks remained “broadly similar” on both sides of the Border. “We’re both dealing with outbreaks associated with meat factories, we both observe greater number of cases in the major urban settings, particularly Belfast and Dublin, and we both have much lower incidence in some of the rural settings.” Concerns have been voiced throughout the pandemic that the existence of the Border could hamper the fight against coronavirus. However, Prof Young said the presence of the Border had had little impact on the spread of the virus or the fight against it, with the exception at the start of the outbreak of the “beneficial” early changes in behaviour by some people in the North, which he said was in part a result of the measures which had been introduced in the Republic. International travelIn regard to international travel through Dublin, Prof Young said the impact had “largely been neutral. If people weren’t coming in through Dublin they’d be coming in through London. “The evidence we have from our test, trace and protect service is that only a very small proportion of our cases at present are associated with travel, so we don’t think that’s a significant driver at the moment in terms of increased case numbers.” There is also, he said, “very good communication and collaboration with our colleagues in the Republic”, with conversations taking place at a minimum once a week, and contact tracing operating on a cross-border basis.The number of coronavirus cases in the North has increased tenfold since early July, with most cases now among younger people. The reproduction – “R” – rate has been consistently above one since the beginning of August, and hospital admissions and bed occupancy figures have also been rising. Over the weekend the North’s department of health reported 138 new cases, bringing the total number of cases since the beginning of the pandemic to 7,187. Prof Young said he was “concerned” at the increase in case numbers, which he described as “steady and progressive and if anything is gathering pace”, and in particular in Belfast, where 134 cases have been identified in the last seven days.

The Minister intends to examine both indoor and outdoor events as part of this process.This would mean gigs may get the green light to proceed potentially without alcohol sales and possibly with larger attendance figures. Under current Government guidelines, only businesses or services such as museums, cinemas, theatres and art galleries can allow a maximum 50 people to congregate indoors because they are deemed to be “controlled environments”. At present all other indoor cultural events are subject to the six-person-maximum rule. “I hope it will assist everyone in developing a better understanding of how we can move forward and strike an appropriate balance between protecting our public health in an effort to ensuring events of greater numbers than current restrictions inside and outside can take place where possible,” Ms Martin said.New powersMeanwhile, the Government will on Monday publish fresh legislation detailing what new powers gardaí will be given to crack down on restaurant and pub owners who do not comply with public-health guidelines.A draft copy of legislation seen by The  states that pub and restaurant owners who reopen their premises during the period of a closure order could face a fine of €5,000 and one year in jail on conviction.The legislation also states that where gardaí have obtained an emergency or temporary closure order, the licence-holder will have to affix a notice outside the building . Anyone who fails to do this will be fined €2,500. These measures come in addition to the new powers being introduced to allow gardaí to close a premises for one day, seven days and 30 days depending on the level of non-compliance. The legislation is due to come before the Dáil this week. However, when the Dáil’s business committee met last Friday, Opposition politicians expressed concern that the Government was attempting to push new powers through the Oireachtas too quickly. Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy told the meeting that legislation was being rushed through the Dáil and that this could result in politicians being “caught out” by unintentional mistakes.On Sunday, the Department of Health confirmed another 42 cases of Covid-19. There were no new deaths for the eighth day in a row. Fifteen cases were confirmed as being associated with outbreaks or close contacts of a confirmed case, with six were identified as community transmission. In terms of the geographic spread, 24 of the cases are located in Dublin, six in Limerick and the remaining 12 are located in Carlow, Clare, Galway, Kildare, Longford, Offaly and Sligo.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4342436.1598827048!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"simon coveney understood to be most likely nominee for eu commissioner role","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is thought to be the frontrunner to be nominated by the Government for the EU trade commissioner role. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe The Government has not yet decided if it will nominate two candidates for the post of EU commissioner despite a request from president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen to put forward one man and one woman.Senior Government sources believe it is increasingly likely the Government will nominate one candidate instead with the current Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney seen as the frontrunner.Fine Gael MEP Mairead McGuinness confirmed on Sunday that she would be interested in succeeding Phil Hogan as Ireland’s European Commissioner and suggested it would be “unwise” for the Government not to put forward both male and female candidates for the role.A spokeswoman for the Government said that the three party leaders met on Friday to discuss the issue and would meet again on Monday, and there had also been contacts over the weekend.“It is in everyone’s interest to fill the vacancy as soon as possible but there is a process in Brussels as well with president and parliament.” ‘Difficult patch’Mr Hogan resigned from his position following controversy over his attendance at an Oireachtas golf society dinner and questions around his movements throughout Ireland before and afterwards in apparent breach of Covid-19 guidelines. Speaking on Sunday, Ms McGuinness said she was interested in the role. “My name is in circulation and yes I’m interested in being the commissioner,” she said on the This Week programme on RTÉ Radio 1. “But, as we all know, the decision is a government’s decision. We’ve been through quite a difficult patch over the last couple of days. Our name in Europe is being spoken of in ways we would rather it wasn’t. “The president of the commission was very clear that she wants nominations soon so that we can move on from the place we are in. There are a lot of other names there as well, but my name is among them.“I think we need to listen very carefully to what the president of the commission Ursula von der Leyen has actually said. She wants the Government to act swiftly, and she wants two names. She wants a woman and a man.” ‘In the mix’Ms McGuinness said nobody from Government circles had sounded her out about the position yet, but admitted she been in contact with one senior figure for advice on the matter. “I think because of my position as first vice-president of the parliament that my name was in the mix early on,” she said. “I spoke to one person who is a good friend of mine for advice.”In relation to Ireland’s chances of retaining the key trade portfolio, Ms McGuinness said there was too much emphasis on that aspect of the discussion in Ireland. “This is about someone who is committed to Europe,” she said. “I think we have forgotten that here in Ireland. We have focused on Ireland’s interests as if they are exclusive and different from European. “Whoever gets this position – man or woman – will be a European commissioner, clearly with an Irish background, but not batting only for Ireland.” Ms McGuinness also said Ireland’s reputation had suffered in Europe as a result of the controversy, but not “in the sense that we cannot recover”.“I think it’s very clear that when any member state is at the centre of a difficult crisis or controversy that lasts over a number of days it’s not good news for us and it’s an uncomfortable position,” she said.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"32 year old russian opposition leader vows keep movement going","story":"Lyubov Sobol was already among the most visible dissidents in Vladimir Putin’s Russia. At 32, she has fronted a protest movement, calling thousands to the streets when she and other opposition candidates were barred from standing in Moscow city elections last year.She staged a hunger strike and a sit-in at the offices of the Moscow election commission, eventually being lifted out of the building on a sofa after she refused to stand for police officers. A laughing Ms Sobol broadcast the incident live from her phone to her vast social media following.She has been sued by one of the most powerful businessmen in the country, and her husband has survived a poisoning. In 2016 an unknown assailant jabbed a syringe into his leg and injected a psychotropic substance that left him convulsing and unconscious, an attack Ms Sobol believes was linked to her activism.Now, with opposition leader Alexei Navalny in a coma in a German hospital after another suspected poisoning, the telegenic lawyer finds herself at the helm of his anti-Kremlin organisation.Doctors at Berlin’s Charite Hospital, where Mr Navalny was transferred from a Siberian clinic, have said he will probably survive the ordeal but may sustain long-term damage.Neither they nor his supporters know when, or even if, he will return to his previous role.Tests at the hospital showed Mr Navalny was poisoned with a “cholinesterase inhibitor”, a group of chemical compounds that includes Novichok, the nerve agent that was used against former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury.Mr Navalny’s team have laid the blame for the attack squarely on Russian authorities, but the Kremlin rejected the claims as “empty noise” and accused German doctors of “rushing to conclusions”.Ms Sobol is part of a trio that have vowed to keep up the pressure of authorities in Mr Navalny’s absence. While she runs his YouTube channels - which have a combined six million subscribers and produce regular reports of wrongdoing among the Russian elite - lawyer Ivan Zhdanov heads Mr Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation and top aide Leonid Volkov oversees political campaigning.In an interview with the , Ms Sobol said the group had no intention of scaling back their broadcasts or corruption investigations.They also plan to campaign against the ruling United Russia party in regional elections next month. Mr Navalny’s group no longer fields candidates itself but encourages supporters to vote for whoever has the best chance of beating United Russia, whether they be from communist or nationalist parties.“I’m working 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” said Ms Sobol, who has worked with Mr Navalny for a decade.“Any injustice gives me more strength and motivates me to work harder.”Before he fell suddenly ill on a flight to Moscow from Siberia ten days ago, Mr Navalny spent months at a time under house arrest or in jail, and relied on a team of legal staff, researchers and other dissidents to keep up pressure on the Kremlin.“There are dozens of people in our organisation all across the country,” Ms Sobol said, pointing to offices in 40 regions of Russia. “These are people who are professional and they are idealistic - they don’t need a boss to make sure they’re in the office from nine to five.”And she argued the poisoning had also made an impression on the general public. “People who were indifferent to the authorities and the opposition have come round to our side because they’ve seen the dirty methods the Kremlin uses.”The dangers of working against Mr Putin, however, are well documented: over his 20-year rule, dissidents have been attacked, poisoned, tried, exiled and, in the case of former opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, assassinated.Mr Navalny himself is partially blind in one eye after an assailant threw green dye in his face on a Moscow street in 2017. Last year he was hospitalised from prison, where he was serving a short term for organising unauthorised protests, with what officials said was an “acute allergic reaction” but he believed was a poisoning.Ms Sobol said she was “saddened but not surprised” by the latest alleged attack.“But I can’t resign myself to the idea that this is normal life. If it can happen to Alexei Navalny, someone who’s known all over the world, it means not a single person can feel safe.“We all understand what we have to do to continue our fight against the Putin regime.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc has real chance reform losing sight purpose","story":"If the BBC\u0027s new director-general was in any doubt about the scale of the challenge he faces in reforming the corporation, events this week will have made it painfully clear.Tim Davie, who takes up his post next week, has already been forced to intervene to bring some much needed common sense to the BBC\u0027s consideration of removing the patriotic anthem Rule, Britannia from the Last Night of the Proms.It seems BBC bosses were so fearful of causing offence to woke activists who claimed the song was racist, they ended up outraging the vast majority of the public who are proud of their country, its heritage and its traditions.What the Rule, Britannia debacle shows is that BBC decision makers have lost sight of who they are working for and are basing decisions on their own sensibilities, rather than the values and views of the audience they are supposed to serve.The BBC has been culturally captured by the woke-dominated group think of some of its own staff. There is a default Left-leaning attitude from a metropolitan workforce mostly drawn from a similar social and economic background.When the BBC moved some of its output out of London, it simply replaced metropolitan London with metropolitan Manchester, Leeds or Glasgow.The BBC has strict editorial guidelines and processes to ensure the sensibilities and sensitivities of its audience are paramount. But all too often, as one insider put it to me, BBC staff are making programmes for other BBC staff - not for licence fee payers.Once the gold standard of impartial, fair and accurate news, BBC journalists are increasingly letting their political preferences show. This can range from subtle bias, such as liking certain tweets, to flagrant breaches of the BBC\u0027s impartiality rules - such as Lewis Goodall, Newsnight\u0027s policy editor, grabbing the cover story of Left-wing magazine New Statesman, with his attack on the handling of exam grading.Over time, BBC\u0027s news teams have focused on other priorities than impartiality - such as making an impact for a particular programme or raising the profile of inidual journalists.Social media has eaten away at BBC impartiality, encouraging staff to see online success in terms of the number of followers or the number of times a post is liked or retweeted. That leads to news programmes seeking controversy and the car-crash interview while journalists blur the line between reporting and political commentary.There is an obvious long-term recruitment challenge for Mr Davie to grapple with but the BBC also requires more urgent reform.The erosion of BBC staff\u0027s online impartiality is subject to an internal review, the results of which will be revealed by Mr Davie in a keynote speech on the corporation\u0027s reform next week. But top-down decrees for a change of direction, no matter how correct, will fall foul of the pervading BBC culture unless enforced with radical action.The BBC\u0027s editorial decisions are devolved to departmental heads, programme editors, item producers, reporters and presenters. That means, unless calls for reform come with a new system that rewards programme impartiality and is accompanied by rigorous enforcement, nothing will change.The BBC\u0027s referendum coverage shows it is more than capable of enforcing impartiality. At the start of the EU referendum campaign, senior BBC executives and news editors met to discuss how to cover what promised to be one of the most potentially isive political events in modern history. There was widespread concern that, regardless of outcome, the losing side in the debate would seek to blame BBC bias in part for the result. It led to the imposition of an impartiality first culture throughout the campaign.Programme commissions were regularly checked to ensure they represented a wide spectrum of views. It was used most notably to prevent soap operas, dramas and specials - from Countryfile to EastEnders - from injecting anti-Brexit political script lines just because it was deemed topical. On news output, everything from running orders and language to guest bookings were subjected to the impartiality test.Yet almost as soon as Britain\u0027s verdict was delivered, the rigorous rules were relaxed and anti-Brexit bias and metropolitan group think crept back into the corporation\u0027s coverage.What was achieved on a temporary basis can become the norm.In order to avoid political bias in news and entertainment, a cross-BBC steering group should be established. Its aim would be to ensure impartiality across all BBC output and that content genuinely reflects the outlook of the country. Impartiality should not be just part of the mix but the number one priority and starting point for every item and running order.In order to provide evidence and benchmarks on which impartiality can be judged, the BBC Board, working with the BBC Editorial Policy and Standards department, should commission regular Ofsted-style reports into inidual programmes and how the BBC is handling a particular running story.The BBC can only be justified as a publicly funded broadcaster if it provides something its commercial rivals and newspapers do not - truly impartial news coverage.Over the past decade, the BBC has drifted away from its purpose and the people it serves. The arrival of Mr Davie offers a real chance to change course - BBC staff must not squander it.Sir Robbie Gibb is the former head of BBC Westminster and former director of communications at No 10 Downing StreetMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit britain should not creating new distant authorities back","story":"Should there be a bonfire of local government? A report, prepared for the County Councils Network, says that abolishing hundreds of district and county councils and consolidating them into 25 larger authorities would save billions of pounds and give communities a “united voice”. Strip out the layers of chief executives and councillors, many of them generously remunerated, and not only could more money be erted into services, but the inefficiencies, duplication – and even corruption – of the current set-up could be done away with.I am no fan of our present system of local government. From the broken City Hall experiment in London, with its imperial mayor and tendency to impose its inner city will on the outer tributaries of the capital, to the ineffective councils that either fail at the very basic duties assigned to them or indulge in wasteful spending that adds nothing to the lives of residents, the story of decentralised power in Britain is often one of incompetence and failure. You do not need to be unlucky enough to live in Tower Hamlets, as I do, where the former mayor was removed from office for electoral fraud, to have personal stories of each.It is no longer even true that councils are keeping the cost of local government down. While there is still significant local variation, invariably council tax is rising well above inflation, and that on top of crime commissioner precepts and social care levies. Council tax is one of the most unfair taxes of all, a charge that takes little account of income, and yet the assumption is that it must continue to go up regardless of economic conditions, or even of the quality of services provided in recompense.But should all of this necessitate a rationalisation of the patchwork quilt of local government? The problem is that, over recent months, we have also seen the terrible consequences of the mantra that bigger must always be better. This is, after all, the logic of the centralised quango state, particularly of the soon-to-be-defunct Public Health England. When these bodies fail, they fail spectacularly, impacting many more people. And does a voter really have more of a “voice” now that they have a mayor of the West Midlands, or wherever? Is democracy served when people are ruled by authorities that cross historic boundaries and accord to no identifiable local demos?The challenge for those of us who, instead, think power should be decentralised much more radically – to the lowest possible level, to discrete areas within boroughs, to towns and even villages – is that they would both need to be trusted to take greater responsibility for raising their own revenues and spending them wisely, and to coordinate with each other as required on issues that cross borders. We would also need to see more internal movement between areas, so bad authorities could be disciplined by residents fleeing, which means stamp duty must go. But other countries seem to manage it. It would be rather strange for Britain to leave the EU, only to create more distant authorities back here at home.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china emerging winner vaccine race jabs reach phase three trials","story":"China is pulling ahead in what could be the final leg of the global coronavirus vaccine race, with four of seven possible candidates in last stage human trials – more than any other country. However, some are concerned about the quality of the vaccines and that they are being used to gain political leverage.Beijing is so confident in its homegrown inoculations that authorities have been administering vaccines for more than a month before clinical studies conclude, authorities revealed this week.People deemed to be at higher risk of infection, such as border officials and state-owned enterprise employees working overseas, have received jabs after the government approved them for emergency use, according to state media. Soon, transport and service workers are also expected to be vaccinated. “The reason why vaccines go through phase 3 trials is to reduce the short and long-term risk to the inidual,” he said. “Giving vaccine shots without this knowledge places iniduals at significant personal risk.” The Chinese government has provided sparse details on which vaccines are being given to people, and how many have been vaccinated, leading to concerns participation may be forced and not voluntary. Last week, Papua New Guinea cancelled a flight from China filled with arriving passengers believed to have received a coronavirus vaccine over worries of the unknown health impact to the local population. In general, “it’s better for a community if there’s more people vaccinated, so there’s less risk of an outbreak of Covid,” said Ben Cowling, ision head of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hong Kong University’s School of Public Health. “At the same time, just having some vaccinated people wouldn’t be enough to mean that social distancing could be relaxed.” Governments are under increasing pressure to find a lasting solution for the devastating pandemic that has swept the world, infecting nearly 25 million and killing more than 830,000. Authorities are also keen to get economies back on track as quarantine measures, though effective in containing the virus, are beginning to impact growth.“Covid is causing economic damage every week, every month, so the sooner we can start using vaccines, the better,” said Mr Cowling.For China, there are additional benefits. Coming up with a successful vaccine would help to deflect anger at home and abroad over its pandemic cover-up, while delivering a blow to US Donald Trump’s “warp-speed” plans for a vaccine. Competition is heating up as well with Russia.The Chinese government “sees science and technology as tools of national greatness,” said Yangyang Cheng, a scientist and postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University. Winning the vaccine race would underscore government propaganda about how “it’s really a hostile world out there, and we, as in the Chinese people, have to rely on ourselves”.It would also give China a new tool for diplomacy and potentially bring more allies into the fold. Indeed Beijing has already vowed “to give priority” to a number of Southeast Asian nations – the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam – if it develops a vaccine. Canada, engaged in a longstanding diplomatic spat with Beijing, had to halt plans to partner in late stage clinical trials as vaccine doses, stalled in Chinese customs, never even arrived.Whether the world will trust a Chinese vaccine remains to be seen.China doesn’t have a great track record. Rushed exports of medical equipment and protective gear this year have turned out to be faulty. The country has also before been plagued with a number of health and food safety scandals, including expired vaccines and tainted baby formula that sickened 300,000 infants and killed at least six in 2008. If early inoculations in China end up failing, experts say that could impact global public confidence in the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines in general. While drug regulators have the power to decide whether or not to approve a Chinese vaccine for use in their own countries, they could come under pressure to fast-track a successful candidate on the market, regardless of who developed the treatment. Countries, though, that China has agreed to conduct advanced tests with include Brazil, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Peru, Morocco, where regulatory hurdles for vaccines to become available may be less stringent than in Western countries like the US or UK.Still, experts are optimistic with so many vaccine candidates in advanced testing, which could eventually yield a few options. Over time, it may also emerge that some vaccines are better suited for certain parts of the population for instance, one type of vaccine could be more effective or suitable for children versus adults, said Mr Cowling.While results of phase three trials won’t be available for another few months, early orders for vaccines are already coming in as nations seek to secure access for their citizens.“The vaccine development process is like a marathon,” said Mr Cowling. “Some vaccines are nearing the end of the journey, but it’s unclear if they will finish. Some of these vaccines may not pan out hopefully they will.”While the coronavirus “does represent a significant threat to humanity,” infections can be controlled with social distancing and other preventative protocols, said Mr Thomas. “It is just that these have economic and political costs.”“The urgency narrative being put out by Chinese, Russian and American officials is more about national prestige and avoiding such costs than about the comprehensive testing of a new vaccine.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"teachers set defy government andblock pupils return classroom","story":"Hundreds of headteachers will defy Government orders and block their pupils’ return to the classroom, a union has warned.A survey by the National Association of Headteachers shows more than 700 schools, or 3 per cent of the total number, will phase students back or use \u0027transition periods\u0027 to reopen.The Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all schools should be fully reopened from the start of September, following heavy disruption to the summer term amid the coronavirus pandemic.Many local authority areas are due to return to school on Tuesday.However, some headteachers still have concerns about fully reopening, despite guidance on student \u0027bubbles\u0027 and measures to promote frequent hand-washing in most schools.The NAHT said the schools postponing their reopening represented a “tiny percentage” and any delays were intended to “alleviate pupils’ anxieties about the return”.The survey came as research by TES magazine, a weekly UK publication aimed at education professionals, suggested that nine in 10 teachers have concerns about social distancing.A poll of nearly 6,000 school staff in England found that 86 per cent of respondents thought minimising contact between pupils would not be possible, while two thirds feared guidance to avoid busy corridors, entrances and exits is unrealistic.The survey, conducted by TES magazine, also found more than a quarter of staff may not comply with the Test and Trace programme should there be a coronavirus outbreak at their school.More than a third feel that the Government\u0027s approach to coronavirus safety in schools will not work and leaves them at risk, the poll showed.Teaching unions have already warned the Government that safety measures will not be enough to protect pupils and staff, and have pressurised ministers to introduce new rules on face coverings in schools in areas under local lockdown.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, urged parents to send their children back to school despite the concerns.“Please do not let the very public political difficulties and arguments cloud your confidence in schools,” he said.“School leaders and their teams have continued to do all that has been asked of them.“With cooperation and understanding between home and school we can achieve the very best return possible despite the political noise”.His call echoed Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, who warned parents who keep their children at home they risk a huge dent in their future life chances.In an open letter to parents, he said the health risk posed to pupils was “extremely low”.If a child is not in school, they stand to lose far more than just a few months of learning. It could well put a huge dent in their future life chances, he said.Education is a birthright, so let\u0027s make sure we get all children back – back to learning, back to playing and back to being kids again.A Government spokesman argued parents were “increasingly confident in their children returning to school”.“Getting all children back into their classrooms full-time in September is a national priority because it is the best place for their education, development and wellbeing,” the spokesman said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks horse whisperer helping animals riders equipilates","story":"It’s commonly thought that lame horses are destroyed because it\u0027s less cruel than forcing them through the necessary recovery period.In severe cases, such as severe fractures, that holds true, but if at all possible Lady Pollyanna FitzGerald prefers a unique form of treatment – horse pilates.And, while she certainly looks nothing like Robert Redford – more English counties than Hollywood cowboy – Pollyanna could be regarded as our very own horse whisperer able to bring traumatised horses back to health by working through a series of what she calls ‘soft tissue corrective exercises’ with the horse.Using a series of specially designed massages for horses she manipulates the animal’s soft tissue to help correct problems and imbalances a horse may be experiencing due to repetitive or strenuous activities and trauma.  The idea of this ‘body work’ is not only to reduce the occurrence of injury and aid recovery from injury and strenuous activities, but also to promote the horse’s well being and relaxation – which is why some have mistakenly described it as ‘horse yoga’.“I do bodywork and stretches with horses,” Lady Pollyanna told The .“I don’t do yoga for humans or horses. I suppose what I do for horses would be akin to human Pilates.”She added: “There are some injuries that horses can not recover from due to their physiology such as a severe break to a leg, hence why they often are put down straight away as this is more humane to the animal.Lady Pollyanna added: “There are so many reasons for lameness. Some are just as simple as a tight, or pulled, muscle that can be easily fixed. I also do a lot of maintenance so that horses are less likely to get injuries from the work they do.”But her work doesn’t stop at the horse. Lady Pollyanna, who, as it happens, is a practitioner of Halo Yoga, as well as Goju Ryu karate, also extends her philosophy to the rider. #Lady Pollyanna, 38, the daughter of the Duke of Leinster, runs her Lightspeed Sports Recovery practice from a stables in Oxford, where she describes the idea behind her work as that of “creating a deeper partnership between rider and horse that works better as a whole”.What she calls EquiPilates is “a wonderful way for the rider to work on imbalances, core strength and understanding their body and how they can influence their horse,” she said, adding: “One is dependant on the other, so when possible it is good to see the horse being ridden and how they interact together to allow me, the practitioner, a deeper understanding on how I can improve them as a unit.”The former Millfield School pupil, who also finds time for a bit of ice hockey, mountain biking and weight lifting, begins by looking at the animal’s movement without a rider.  This is done by watching the horse move in circles and straight lines in all three gaits walking, trotting and cantering, allowing Lady Pollyanna to observe the horse’s “movement biomechanics” and identify any areas that might need some work, such as lameness.She added: “I also talk to the rider about how the horse feels to ride. For example do they feel stiff going one direction, but not the other.”The horse is then examined and its joint movements checked to identify tight muscles and sore areas. There follows a course of massage, or soft tissue work, followed by acupressure, stretching, core exercises and strengthening exercises.“The owner is then taught some of the key exercises to continue between treatments. In short I act like a personal trainer to the horse and direct the owner to continue the process to get the most gains,” she says.The same method is then used on the rider to assess their movement, followed by soft tissue work and a series of exercises.“Once horse and rider are both physically more functional and comfortable I will work with the horse and rider together,” says Lady Pollyanna.“Often the focus is on the rider and getting an improved posture to allow the horse to move better.

Research published by the Royal Society predicts a 3 per cent loss in future annual earnings for affected pupils: a scar across their entire working lives. Likewise, the working parents of school-aged children have been struggling with increasing desperation since March.Zero or very limited schooling since then, and an almost complete cancellation of summer holiday clubs have left many hamstrung. A significant but growing minority – predominantly women – have been forced to take reduced pay or, in some cases, to become an unemployment statistic.Leave aside, for now, that for many, school will feel quite different to the version last seen in March, and let’s close our eyes, momentarily, to the concerns aired by many parents about a school regime that includes social distancing, face coverings and a restricted curriculum. Working parents could briefly rejoice that schools were definitely, unequivocally, going back, full time, from September.But then, at 9.30pm on Friday, the Government published its updated Guidance for Schools. All 25,000 words of it.Reading the new rules, I was gobsmacked. Most notably, they contained a \u0027two week on, two week off\u0027 rota system for schools in local lockdown areas. Both the timing and content of this document shows a callous disregard for just about everyone affected: school leaders, teachers, working parents and – most of all – children.Let’s be clear: rota learning will be a disaster for children already so cruelly subordinated during lockdown. The evidence is unequivocal: online lessons are no substitute for school. We know that one fifth of children did less than an hour a day of schoolwork at home during lockdown and 71 per cent of state school children received no, or less than one, daily online lesson.It is equally a disaster for working parents. The preamble to the guidance states that it “has been developed with input from school leaders, unions, sector bodies, PHE, and the HSE”. Not, then, those on whom the policy has the greatest impact: parents. The Government seems oblivious to the fact that for most working parents, school provides essential childcare as much as an education – we simply can’t do our jobs without it.It is savagely ironic that this comes in the week the Government is briefing that we might lose our jobs if we don’t get back to the office pronto. Is it really any surprise given how this Government has behaved on schools that the British have been the slowest in Europe to get back to the office?Continuity of schooling for this cohort of children should now be non-negotiable, but as the Government seems unable to guarantee this, and with no exit plan in sight, we must talk about the options for parents who reject this as the new normal.Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, says there must now be “increased childcare investment and strengthened rights to flexible working”. This is indeed urgent, but alone it is not sufficient. Parents must be paid back their taxes for weeks of schooling missed. Legislation must be introduced to make parenthood a legally protected characteristic. Working parents should not be at risk in the workplace because the state has failed to provide schooling.The Better Regulation Framework, requiring government departments to consult with those affected by policy decisions that affect businesses, must be extended, so that changes like this can never again be waived through without a full and proper discussion.Working parents are the backbone of this country and children are its future. We must decide whether or not we want a society that supports families in a meaningful and sustainable way.

Any suggestion that this is what we are asking for is misleading, deliberately harmful and incorrect. I have no plans to strive for any legislation of this sort.”She added: “It goes without saying that I am driven by the heinous killing of my brave husband and the safety of his colleagues in the future.”Mrs Harper is due to meet with Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, next month for talks in an effort to harness political support for the new law.She and her 28-year-old husband, a Thames Valley Police offer, had been married for just four weeks when he and a colleague responded to a late-night burglary in Sulhamstead, Berkshire, last August.Emphasising that it was a “personal campaign”, Mrs Harper said she was “hugely grateful” for the support and backing of Thames Valley Police Federation and Pc Harper’s colleagues across England and Wales.“However, let me say again that this is my endeavour and I take on all responsibility (and any resistance should it come) towards it,” she added.It comes after a judiciary spokesman confirmed that Henry Long, one of Pc Harper’s killers, had applied for permission to appeal against his 16-year prison sentence. His co-accused, Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both 18, have also lodged applications seeking permission to challenge their convictions and their 13-year prison sentences.All three were sentenced for manslaughter after Pc Harper got caught in a crane strap attached to the back of a car driven by Long, and was dragged to his death.The sentences have already been referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General for judges to decide whether they were too lenientMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories wore frank spencer benny crossroads","story":"A magnicent record to behold. I cannot remember any government being so devoid of direction, leadership, policy, conviction and — frankly — intelligence.And I had to endure Ted Heath AND John Major’s attempts to run the country. Oh, and the shaft of glorious sunshine that was Gordon Brown. Those guys have nothing on Boris. He is the clear leader in the field. If you ever wanted to know what a country would look likeit was led by Frank Spencer, here you go. Yes, I know — I’m showing my age. To be honest, under this administration I’m feeling my age.For those who don’t remember, Frank was a bumbling, dithering, halfwit from the s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The only dference with Bojo is that Frank was thinner. And, mercully, a fictional creation. Boris is all too real. Many kids will be going back to school wearing face masks. For ages, this government insisted that they would not have to do so. Now they’ve changed their minds. Face masks and grouped in “bubbles”. Probably getting only about half of their usual education,that. Any kid who coughs will be pounced upon, exiled to the Outer Hebrides and the entire school shuts down. Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low. And yet the BBC is still up to its tricks. Pulling off the unusual feat of being already in a coffin, but reaching out somehow to hammer more nails into its own lid.A TEAM of British scientists has been studying dreams and what they mean.And they’ve discovered they mean sod all. They are just a continuation of memories from the previous day.Other recent studies showed the same thing. So,you dream you’re flying around your house with some bats, it means you were probably thinking about bats when you were awake.It doesn’t mean you’re neurotic or sexually repressed. So – that’s all the work of Sigmund Freud in the bin. It can go in a black bin liner along with the idiocies put forward by that other drongo of the th Century, Karl Marx. But given that we know all this, why are there still psychoanalysts plying their trade  Is it just to give Britain’s couch-makers plenty of work ANOTHER stupid, virtue-signalling British firm has run into trouble.Avanti West Coast made a big fuss about its new “pride train”, which runs from London to Manchester.The engine is painted in the colours of the LGBT rainbow flag.And it has the word “Pride” written in big letters – just in case anyone doesn’t get the message. There have been thousands of angry comments on social media.My favourite was from John James McGivern: “As a gay man, I don’t want a ‘pride train’, I just want to get on a train that runs on time like everyone .” Quite. Well said.Every time companies pull a stunt like this, the nation cringes.I don’t want a bloody voucher. You cancel the train I’m booked on, then refund the ticket.So I complain to them and they say nothing we can do.So I complain some more and tell them they’re acting illegally.Bingo – money back! I know a lot of people have had similar problems with airlines cancelling their flights and offering “vouchers”.It pays to pester these buggers. Pester and pester until they give in.POOR old slabhead, then. Manchester United’s Harry Maguire found himself uttering the most stupid words in the English language.“Do you know who I am ” And then explained to the Greek police officers who had arrested him that he was “very rich”. Then he tried to bribe them.⚠️Click here for the latest news on Harry MaguireGod help us all.I have always admired Maguire’s heading ability.It now seems to me that he gets so much force behind each header because he has reinforced concrete between his ears. Footballers are not renowned for being terribly bright.But Maguire has lowered the bar still further.One of the problems is the one to which the footballer alluded. He has too much money. So much that he doesn’t know what to do with it.And as a result is completely insulated from the real world. And when he does venture out into the real world it is to be continually abused by halfwits who do not like the club he plays for.Say sorry to the Greeks, Harry. And then shut up and play football.Andlouts give you abuse in the street, just smile at them.CHILDREN from working families were much better behaved during lockdown, according to a study from three British universities.I know that will come as news to some of you.A lot of kids seemed to be climbing the walls out of sheer boredom. But the researchers found that the kids had fewer tantrums.

As a result, very few people watch it — but it’s the toast of Beeb journos and left-wing social media, giving it undeserved influence over our daily news agenda.Despite her dressing-down over that outrageous Dominic Cummings monologue, Emily Maitlis is considered untouchable by executives. No one dares warn her that constant unbalanced questioning of Tory politicians and right-wing commentators is putting the very future of the Beeb under threat.And then there’s Lewis Goodall, the left-wing operative turned Newsnight policy editor who last week was allowed to author a feature for the New Statesman magazine headlined: “Failed. How the Government’s ineptitude created a lost generation.”As Theresa May’s former communications chief Sir Robbie Gibb put it: “Is there anyone more damaging to the BBC’s reputation for impartiality than Lewis Goodall ”I’ve read the thinly veiled left-wing think piece so you don’t have to.Goodall’s main thesis is to try to link the Covid-created A-level exams situation to the Windrush scandal.If it had been written by Owen Jones in the , I’d understand.But a full-time BBC staff member who we are consistently told is an impartial journalist, with no bias against the Government  Puh-lease! We cannot suspend our disbelief any longer.One thing Newsnight does best is sanctimony.We saw it again this week as the show’s editor, Esme Wren, planned to host a navel-gazing session at the Edinburgh TV Festival called Reporting Racism: TV Journalism And Black Lives Matter.Only problem is that Newsnight, for all its left-wing posturing, is the most middle-class, white news broadcast on the box.In fact, an investigation by the Mail on Sunday revealed the programme has NO non-white presenters and has been nicknamed NewsWhite behind the scenes.So a bunch of privately educated, rich, privileged members of the London liberal media elite — the very definition of champagne socialists — are on a nightly basis doing untold harm to the reputation of the BBC.But it’s too late now, the damage is done.The BBC hates everything we love about Britain.They are repelled by patriotism. They cannot stand anyone who dares not vote Labour or Lib Dem. They will never forgive Brexit voters for destroying their European fantasy.And they fetishise Nicola Sturgeon’s unrealistic idea of Scottish independence.But this week, as Dame Vera Lynn’s version of Land Of Hope And Glory hurtled towards the top of the iTunes chart, the fight back began.SINCERE condolences to Sir Ed Davey on winning the Liberal Democrat leadership yesterday.My thoughts are with you at this dficult time.SARAH Harding is the fighter of the entertainment industry.Vulnerable to a fault, during her time in Girls Aloud she shared her many trials and tribulations with that trademark throaty laugh and a glint in her eye.Unlike so many pop stars, there was never a hint of ego.

Harry and Meghan later sent a personal note of “great thanks” to Jeremy and Laura, writing: “Cruz is a fascinating historical figure, and we look forward to learning more about her le and works.

Butwe want fans back at sport fixtures across the country from October , as the Prime Minister set out in our recovery roadmap, we’ll need to be creative too.And that’s where tech comes in. Today I can reveal we are forming a crack team of sport, health and tech experts called the Sport Tech Innovation Group, who will work with sports bodies including the Premier League and ECB and the ground safety regulator to explore high-tech solutions that can get fans back into venues in greater numbers.That kind of tech could include tracking devices to measure social distancing between fans, and fluorescent disinfectants to reveal how often surfaces are touched. Or innovative tech to assist in safe travel, and reduce crowding as fans make their way to venues.This isn’t just about sport.

Nilsen, who died behind bars in , murdered at least  young men in North London, dressing his victims before dissecting them.The letters, written by Nilsen after he was given a le term in  for murder and attempted murder, were kept by DCI Jay’s son Simon after the policeman died of cancer in February .A few months after the detective’s death, producers spoke to his family.Simon handed over the correspondence, along with hundreds of notes, crime scene sketches and interview transcripts kept in a dusty briefcase for decades, so the programme makers could ensure their TV drama told the true story.In an exclusive interview Simon, , of Tewin, Herts, said: “I had no idea of the existence of the briefcase, but mum revealed that he had kept key notes from the case.“When I opened it I found the letters from Nilsen to dad. It gave me chills to know that the hand who wrote this had slaughtered so many men so horrically.“I was proud to see what dad did in this landmark case.

He wanted to regain control.“His fury at being caught and exposed as the evil monster he was is there in black and white.”The letters show that DCI Jay wanted to conduct further interviews with Nilsen prior to his conviction.Simon — dad to two-year-old Noah with partner Louise,  — also revealed that his father saved his le when he twice attempted suicide due to depression at university.He said: “Dad dropped everything to be there when I needed him.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson warned parents that children risked a huge dent in their future le chancesthey did notto the classroom. In a letter to parents, he said: If a child is not in school, they stand to lose far more than just a few months of learning. It could well put a huge dent in their future le chances. Education is a birthright, so letaposs make sure we get all children back - back to learning, back to playing and back to being kids again. But teaching unions reacted with fury when the Government published last-minute guidance for schools in lockdown areas - only days before pupils were due to go back for the new term. Here are some of the changes in store for schools in England. How will classrooms look dferent  Desks will be arranged to face forward to prevent the spread of infection, rather than allowing children to sit facing each other at tables. Windows and doors should be left open where possible to allow air to circulate. There will be increased handwashing facilities and hand sanitiser available - with teachers told to supervise younger children when using sanitiser. Social distancing to two metres should be followed whenever it is possible.  Children can bring their school bags with them but they should only have essential items such as books, lunch boxes and phones. Teachers are told to avoid sharing equipment such as books and games between dferent groups - and rigorous cleaning measures should be in place. What about communal areas  Ministers ditched advice for bubbles of  pupils but classes or year groups should kept apart to prevent the spread of infection. Many schools will have one-way systems in corridors, with staggered starts for lessons and for break times. Masks can be worn in corridors and communal areas in secondary schoolsheadteachers wish but it is not mandatory. Children should not wear masks in classrooms.  To prevent mixing between dferent groups, lunch could also be staggered, with some schools separating year groups and classes. Will the curriculum be the same  Schools have some freedom to help children catch up but the curriculum must remain broad and ambitious. The Government allows for substantial modication to the syllabus at the start of the year, with pupils allowed to drop some subjects in exceptional circumstances. But schools should aim to be back to their normal curriculum by next summer.  There will be a ban on assemblies, collective worship and choirs - as there is an increased risk of infection from singing and shouting. Music lessons should be restricted to groups of less than . PE lessons can continue although outdoor sports should be the priority. All equipment must be regularly cleaned. Will children need to wear masks  Secondary school pupils and staff can be told to wear face coverings in hallways and communal parts. This becomes mandatorythe area is in local lockdown. However masks are not advised in classrooms in any circumstances. What happensthe school is in a lockdown area  Under new rules, secondary schools pupils will be required to wears masks in communal areas in the first instance. Heads must draw up plans for two week rota system for dferent groups, so pupils can spend a fortnight at home to seesymptoms emerge. Week-on week-off rotas are also an option to keep children from mixing. In the most extreme circumstances, all children will be sent home to study remotely again - with only the most vulnerable or children of key workers staying in school.  Whatthere is an outbreak at the school  Schools will have to declare an outbreakthey have more than two  coronavirus  cases in two weeks or there has been a surge in pupils taking sick days where they might have coronavirus. Heads can summon mobile testing unitsthey are worried about cases and schools have been given a small number of home testing kits to give to parents who may struggle to get their children tested. However routine testing in schools is not advised. Children who have been in close contact with a student with Covid- will have to self isolate at home.

If quicker action is not taken, the Government risks letting down those who expected things to change after Grenfell, she wrote. “People must be reassured they are not living with the possibility of faulty appliances that could risk setting their homes on fire.” Faulty fridge wiring was identied as the probably cause of the Grenfell Tower blaze, which caused the deaths of  people in . An analysis from the charity Electrical Safety First earlier this month found nearly a quarter of accidental electrical fires in high-rise buildings was caused by faulty appliances, leads or fuel supplies. The number of accidental electrical fires in tower blocks has risen in each of the last three years, from  to - to  in -. And more than , tumble driers manufactured by Whirlpool have been recalled over a safety issue which could cause fire. But Ms Jones said only % have been registered to the recall programme.

Obviously, schools haven’t had any chance whatsoever to incorporate this into their planning and will now have to revisit the plans they have put in place.” "},{"url":null,"title":"busy mum who tried have","story":"NewsBusy mum who tried to have it all has heart attack at  - but says it was for the bestEsther Stanhope lived at a million miles a minute but a heart attack aged  forced her to change her manic London lestyle – and now shes got a second chanceShareCommentsByEmma Jones:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video heart-attack-sufferer-warns-signs-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,loginRadius:true,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableAboutTopics:true,GDPRConsentEnabled:,viafouraComments:true,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,loginRadius:true,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableAboutTopics:true,GDPRConsentEnabled:,viafouraComments:true,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news real-le-stories busy-mum-who-tried-have-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

My job in TV and radio was a dream. I loved developing programmes and working on shows like Strictly, and with people like Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes. I also got to go to glamorous events such as the Cannes Film Festival. I think my driven personality must have come from my dad, who died of a heart attack aged just . I was only five, but my mum later told me he was always on the go, just like me. All I remember is being carried on his shoulders and the smell of his leather jacket – then one day he was gone, leaving me, my four siblings and my mum, who was pregnant at the time. When I started my career in the s, I wanted to work hard and play hard. In the media, everyone was like me, with their whole work le balance revolving around social events. I’d go to film screenings and launches, where there was always champagne and canapés. I probably drank and smoked a bit too much, but no more than anyone . I’d try to make time for the gym, but something always cropped up and I’d put it off. But in , when I’d had my second child, Truman, now nine, a brother for my daughter, Mirabelle, now , I decided I wanted to do something for myself, using the skills I’d picked up from years in the media. So I launched my own company – The Impact Guru – advising business people on how to make the best of themselves. It took off immediately, with high-profile iniduals and blue-chip companies wanting my advice. I found myself saying yes to everything. I’d be thinking, ‘Where can I get clients  How can I sustain the revenue  If I stop spinning plates, I’m going to drop them all.’  I loved it, but I was a whirling dervish – booking my travel and hotels here and abroad, setting up meetings and speeches, even doing my own accountancy. I knew that my husband Adam, , a film producer, and the kids thought I was overdoing it, and at the back of my mind I knew they were right. But it wasn’t until late summer  that I really realised I was taking on too much. One day in September, I was due to speak at the University of Greenwich in London, and had arranged to meet Claire, who I was interviewing to be my assistant, at the station. That was typical of me – cramming in as much as I could. I remember thinking, ‘Any normal person would sit down to chat over a cup of coffee. She must think I’m insane.’ Amazingly, Claire took the job, but even though I no longer had all that admin to deal with, I was still packing in at least eight meetings a week. In June , I was at the airport bright and early for a flight to Amsterdam. As I waited for the shuttle to the terminal I couldn’t catch my breath. It wasn’t terrible, so I just put it down to rushing about in the humidity. But it happened again when I landed back in the UK.  When I got home I said to Adam, ‘I don’t think it’s anything to worry about, but I had this weird feeling. I’ll get it checked after I’ve been to New York.’ Three weeks later I was in America at a conference and it happened again. This time my left arm was numb too. I’d arranged a day off to go to the gym with my sister-in-law, who lived with my brother over there. But in the middle of a CrossFit class I went a bit green and felt a tightness in my chest. I had to go outside. I thought I was just horribly unfit because it passed after I’d taken some deep breaths, but my sister-in-law wanted me to see a doctor there. ‘No, it’s fine,’ I said. ‘It’s not likeI was going to collapse.’ But I started to think something might be wrong. When I got home I called my GP about my symptoms and askedit was worth coming in. ‘Long-haul flight, father died of a heart attack, tightness in chest  Go straight to AE,’ she said.  Adam and I walked to The Royal London Hospital in East London, and I had to stop a few times because I was finding it hard to breathe. I got in at am and was quickly referred to a heart specialist for all kinds of tests. I had a meeting at pm and said to the cardiologist, ‘I’ll be out before then, won’t I ’ She stared at me. ‘You do know you’re being treated for a heart attack ’ she said. ‘It’s mild, but still serious. You have to stay here.’ I couldn’t believe it. I honestly thought I was being a bit of a fraud being admitted because I felt OK. ‘I’m not dying!’ I insisted. I postponed all my appointments and just sat in my hospital bed. Because I had nothing better to do, I wrote my blog. I spent a week there and for the first time in ages I enjoyed just relaxing. My family and friends came to see me and I tapped away writing – the first time I’d ever done anything like that. The doctors diagnosed a blocked artery to my heart and inserted a stent to open it – they make a tiny hole in your wrist and thread the stent all the way up to your heart.  I wasn’t very fit and was a little overweight – by just a stone or so. My diet was OK, but it was inherited cholesterol problems and my smoking and stressful lestyle that did it. I was put on statins, which I was told to take for the rest of my le. Lestyle change I’d been overdoing it for years, throwing myself into my career. I gave up smoking and I no longer drink as much. I walk everywhere to do my , steps and go to the gym – but not at am like I used to. I made a decision not to be stressed any more, pushing myself and being in a constant state of low-level panic. I no longer stand on the Tube  checking my watch and sweating because I’m late. I’m realistic and do two things a day, not .

Even though the weather has been chilly and windy during the night, groups of friends took to the street to celebrate the long weekend.Two girls were spotted wearing face masks with their party dresses, but many others did not wear one. Revellers were drinking in the street - with some having too many drinks to the point that they vomited in the street. Party-goers ready for a night out were also seen in Newcastle. In Leeds, some people joined a local busker, singing and dancing together.  Party-goers hit Birmingham’s city centre and queued up to get into some of the bars that have reopened since the coronavirus lockdown. One woman was wheeled into an ambulance after she was unable to walk home. Her friends reportedly took care of her before paramedics arrived. Revellers were also seen in central London, with a woman photographed as she lay on the pavement in Soho. Manchester also saw people going out and flouting coronavirus lockdown rules as party-goers were seen drinking and hugging across the city.  A man in Newcastle was seen with a face mask on his forehead as he smiled at his friends. Several police forces, including politan Police, urged people not to join unlicensed events which put communities at risk due to the Covid- pandemic. The force tweeted: Unlicensed music events are illegal, dangerous and often linked to anti-social behaviour and violence. People who attend unlicensed music events are putting themselves, their families and their communities at risk. Please think about others and stay at home. Tougher fines have been introduced ahead of the Bank Holiday targeting the most serious breaches of social distancing restrictions.  The new regulations, which came into force on August , aim to prevent further spread of the virus. Those facilitating or organising illegal raves, unlicensed music events, or any other unlawful gathering of more than  people may face a £, fine. Fines of £ can continue to be issued to those who participate in illegal gatherings. Those who have already received a fine will see the amount of doubled on each offence, up to a maximum of £,. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: These gatherings are dangerous and those who organise them show a blatant disregard for the safety of others. I am pleased the police have already stepped up their response and I am giving them the tools they need to continue to keep us safe. We will continue to crack down on the small minority who think they are above the law.  In areas of concern – such as Leicester and Greater Manchester - deployments have already been larger than on New Year’s Eve. National Police Chiefs’ Council Lead for Unlicensed Music Events, Commander Ade Adelekan, said: We welcome this further deterrent against those who irresponsibly put people’s health and safety at risk by organising these events. Unlicensed music events are unlawful and unregulated. These events are hosted without regard for the safety of those attending, and police have observed cases of anti-social behaviour, sales of drugs and gang activity. It is vital that forces obtain information about any illegal events at the earliest opportunity. As organisers are able to spread the word about these events quickly online, timely information about suspicious activity or plans enables forces to plan ahead and take effective action against them."},{"url":null,"title":"eat out help out ends","story":"NewsEat Out to Help Out ends today - but heres where it will carry on in SeptemberMany restaurants have called for the Eat Out to Help scheme to be extended beyond August, but No seems fairly adamant the deal will not be ing, though multiple venues are continuing into September regardlessShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video restaurants-still-offer-eat-out-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Diners and restaurateurs have called for the campaign to be extended as Rishi Sunak thanked customers for enthusiastically taking the offer up.The deal, dubbed Rishiaposs dishes, comes to a close on Bank Holiday Monday after a month of  percent discounts up to £ per head at participating restaurants. Downing Street said more than  million meals had been claimed for so far since the Monday to Wednesday initiative was launched in an attempt to boost the hospitality industry in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak., outlets signed up, according to the most recently released Treasury statistics. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Mr Sunak thanked those customers who headed out to take up the offer and helped secure the jobs of . million people in the hospitality sector. Research suggests trade on some days in the month was twice last yearaposs levels. As a result, a number of chains and establishments have said they will continue the practice into September despite Government financial support being withdrawn. Andy Lennox, who runs the two Zim Braai restaurants in Bournemouth, said Eat Out allowed him recoup some of his losses with his businesses having survived on the governmentaposs emergency support schemes. Tradeaposs record-breaking at the moment, he told the BBC. It is a  bubble so weaposre not getting too excited, but Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are up probably % [on last year]. The weekaposs up %.

This week weaposve done breakfast, dinner, breakfast, dinner. We probably would not have gone out as much without it, she said.  We had to book the restaurants before we left home to get the availability, because itaposs so popular.Greater Manchesteraposs night tsar Sacha Lord said on Twitter last week: I strongly urge @RishiSunak to announce an extension of #EatOutToHelpOut.Stopping this next week, combined with rents due and the phasing out of furlough will be a combined combination leading to closure for many restaurants across the UK.  And the Federation of Small Businesseswants to see Eat Out to Help Out extended through to September, with its chairman Mike Cherry describing the next months as economic make or break.It comes after members of the public  launched an online petition for an official extension of the scheme  to support small businesses at risk of collapse.Nick MacKenzie, chief executive of Greene King, said while many of his sites saw surges of up to  percent, central London was done  percent.  Iaposve called for the government to think about maybe doing a similar scheme for city centres and for London. We need to get people back into cities particularly into central London. Comptoir Café and Wine in central London is one of those restaurants, meanwhile, which is offering its own deals beyond Eat Out - with  percent off on Mondays to Wednesdays in September. But thataposs thanks to landlord Grosvenor agreeing to subsidise the deal. As the Government scheme comes to a close, Mr Sunak diners have fallen back in love with their local while staff have worked tirelessly. The scheme reminded us why we as a nation love dining out and I urge diners to maintain the momentum to help continue our economic recovery. Jemima Ferguson, marketing director at itsu, said the scheme has helped to drive over  percent more transactions without negatively impacting trade during the rest of the week. We believe ripple effects from the positive impact of this scheme will be felt for many months to come, she added. Meg Ellis, of Honest Burgers, said: Weaposve been really encouraged by the sht in energy in our sector as a result of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.

Dr Andrew Kemp, head of the Scientic Advisory Board on the British Institute of Cleaning Science, said overuse of alcohol-based hand gels will allow other bacteria and viruses on our hands to develop immunity to it.People across the world have been advised to use the sanitisers throughout the pandemic, applying them for months to prevent the spread of coronavirus. However, Dr Kemp told thethe use of hand gels should be a short-term solution only or risk potentially catastrophic consequences.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  The Lincoln University academic said the best way to fight bacteria and viruses is by simply washing your hands regularly. Hand gels should only be used as a last resort and as a short term temporary measure or stop gapsoap and water are not available, he explained. At the moment there is no published proof that alcohol gels killed Covid- itself. Eventhey did kill . percent of all bacteria, there can be more than a million bacteria on your hands at any one time leaving , alive after sanitisation.  Recent research shows the surviving bugs which are not killed by alcohol gels are themselves highly dangerous pathogens and may increase in numbers. This means our routine use of gels could ultimately cause us more harm than good. The work was published in the American Journal of Biomedical Science and Research and will be presented at a leading conference on superbugs in Amsterdam in October. It is likely to raise alarm among public health officials who have been advocating widespread use of gels to combat the spread of the disease.

The Duke of Sussex hopes the -month-old royal will develop the same love for the sport he has, but the dad-of-one is currently struggling to find mini rugby balls small enough. He was speaking during a special Zoom quiz of players, coaches and volunteers from Rugby Football League to mark its th birthday. The former senior royal was joined by St Helens Women’s Super League players Gemma Walsh and Emily Rudge, Leeds Rhinos and England star Jamie Jones-Buchanan and his son Kurgan, Newcastle Thunder’s Jordan Robinson and academy player Alex Donaghy as well as volunteer Fionna Everson. Harry, who has now settled in Santa Barbara with we Meghan and little Archie, after officially quitting the Firm in March, is the leagueaposs patron. What I need is a few mini rugby balls that I can then get Archie involved with the game, because at the moment itaposs impossible to find any, he told the group. But Iaposve got a little space outside, which Iaposm fortunate enough to have so I need to get him playing some Rugby League. Iaposm just unbelievably fortunate and grateful to have outdoor space and see my son able to be outside, because I know so many people just havenapost had that opportunity in the last five months, Harry said, referring to the coronavirus pandemic.Our little man is our number one priority but our work after that is the second priority and we’re just trying to do everything we can to do our part to make the world a better place, he added.Harry went on to assure those in the virtual chat that he has plans toto the UK - in particular for the Rugby World Cup which begins in October next year."},{"url":null,"title":"pub owners brutal reply entitled","story":"NewsPub owners brutal reply to entitled little toddlers negative reviewThe Cowshed at Hucknall didnt hold back when they received a negative review on Facebook from a woman who claimed the staff had an \"awful attitude\" even though her party supposedly spent £ thereShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience WriterSophie FosterLestyle  Travel Reporter:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video pub-owners-brutal-reply-entitled-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The woman called Jo left the review after visiting The Cowshed at Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, for her sister-in-lawaposs th birthday. She claimed that her party spent approximately £ between them on drinks and pizza before they were asked to leave by staff with awful attitude for being too drunk. In the review Jo wrote, she said: [They] didn’t mind taking the £ though, I have never been spoken to in such a way. Maybe they should open reviews [on their website].She then added: And, yes, our family member was sick, and yes, we cleaned it up so no members of staff were affected by this. Maybe a course for your staff in customer service wouldn’t go amiss – rude staff, huffing and puffing because they had a large round to bring out. But the restaurant, which has a five star rating on TripAdvisor, shared their version of events from the night on Facebook by saying: Hi Jo, thanks for reaching out! We love feedback, whether it be positive or negative, we especially love feedback like this so others can see the type of people we have to deal with sometimes.  Firstly, it said that Jo hadnapost spent the amount of money she claimed she did. To spend that amount of money they would have had to have ordered  of their most expensive pizzas and  of their most expensive drinks... The Cowshed continued: You ordered nowhere near this, Jo... not even close. What you and your party spent, Jo, was a far more realistic and believable £ . Then it got a little brutal.  It added: You all acted like belligerent, entitled little toddlers from the moment you walked through our gates. At :pm you showed up with the tables you wanted already taken, but not to worry, we shuffled other customers about at your request in order to accommodate you.  Then you proceeded to pull our light fittings loose off our boundary fence in order to hang your birthday decor. We cleaned up all the smashed pint glasses you broke and birthday cake you dropped and smeared all over our tables and benches, and tolerated the many loud family rows you were having with each other. The group also supposedly treated The Cowshedaposs staff  like personal servants. It wrote: Clicking your fingers, shouting, swearing and barking your orders at [staff], to the point one was almost in tears and refused to deal with you any more. But it didnapost stop there. He also claimed the group refused to abide by social distancing rules following the coronavirus pandemic. Then, for your partyaposs grand finale, the gentleman in the blue shirt headed into our bar from outside and decided to vomit everywhere but the toilet. Our staff stepped into to help, but you demanded to aposdeal with the situationapos and rather than clean up the mess, proceeded to smear it over an even wider area with our mop, whilst... once again, being loud, rude, sticking your hand in our staffaposs faces and shouting over anybody who was trying to communicate with you or help. Donapost worry, the staff member that you nearly had in tears earlier on cleaned it up for you.

Another wrote: Congratulations Cowshed! You have won the internet today! One woman commented: Never been, didnapost know you existed, but might have to pay a visit now... Another new fan said: Wow. Weaposve never been to the Cowshed but we certainly intend doing so. More so after reading your honest response to Jo who I hope to never meet her or her party. Ever. Another commenter said: Weaposre moving to Hucknall soon, looks like we already have a new fave restaurant!  In the review Jo wrote, she said: [They] didn’t mind taking the £ though, I have never been spoken to in such a way. Maybe they should open reviews [on their website].

Putting rule breakers together into detention could risk further spreading the virus and so it has been deemed safer to send them back home. A letter sent out by Jerome Scafe, an associate principal at Ark Alexandra Academy in Hastings, East Sussex, warned even jokes about the killer bug are banned. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   Seen by the Daily Mail, the letter said undesirable behaviours may result in a fixed-term exclusion.This included deliberate or malicious coughs sneezes, inappropriate comments about Covid- and purposeful physical contact with others. It added repeated failure to follow the rules could see pupils needing to be removed from lesson.  Byron Academy in Acton, West London, meanwhile, has warned coughing deliberately on someone  is now potentially extremely serious and those wilfully ignoring restrictions face possible exclusion. John Flamsteed Community School in Derby has said specic toilets have been earmarked for break and lunch for certain students and this must be adhered to or will be treated as a very serious disciplinary matter. All schools want pupilsapos unorms washed every day, though ties canapost be worn, andthey have sport on their timetable that day children must arrive at school in their PE kit. "},{"url":null,"title":"schools coronavirus covid opening rules","story":"AdvertorialAll the things which are changing as schools and colleges open doors againEducational institutions are ready to welcome pupils back safely – and the benefits to their wellbeing and mental health are hugeShareByDave Masters:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG AdvertorialIt’s the start of a new term and it’s time for children across the country to get back to school, nursery and college. Many parents, pupils and teachers are excited to get back into the routine and although it’s understandable to have a few worries the benefits of going back into education are clear. Not only will pupils be learning again, but they’ll benefit from the sense of routine, the chance to see their friends and a boost to their wellbeing. With new safety measures in place things will look a bit dferent, but pupils will be guaranteed plenty of support from their teachers.  Dr Paul Phillips CBE, , the Principal and Chief Executive of the Weston College Group in Somerset is one of many leaders who’s worked hard to make the learning environment safe and welcoming for ing students. He said: If you came into my campuses you’d see the one-way system, you’d see all the sanitisers, you’d see the counselling service, you’d see the ability for us to check temperatures, but behind that are the inidual learning plans for each student. That’s where the crucial planning really takes place. We’ve increased the number of mental health advisors and support workers who are here, we’ve put a massive investment into all levels of additional learning support at tutorial level, mentoring and one-to-one teaching. I’ve doubled the amount of cleaners in the college – I just need to be assured that everything we do is protecting everyone.  Home schooling hasn’t been easy and many parents are worried that their children have fallen behind, but parenting expert and author Dr Kalanit Ben-Ari believes they’ll catch up quickly and that getting back into the classroom will boost their mental health. I’m not worried about the academic gap, because I think kids will pick up very quickly. But it’s starting to affect their mental health more and more, so it’s good that they will be back in school from September, says Dr Ben-Ari. Children are not designed to sit down all day. They need to be out in the fresh air and moving their bodies. It’s so important for children of all ages to interact with their friends face to face for communication, and non-verbal communication.  Kids at home have spent a long time on screens while parents are working and they don’t have the resources to entertain and teach their children at home. Spending more time on screens will have affected their mental health: it increases anxiety, especially with children who are a little bit more vulnerable to it. For Chloe Williams, a beauty therapy student at Weston College, thecan’t come soon enough. I feel ready to go for a long-awaited  and seeing the new socially distanced facilities has been great, she says. My tutors are very approachableI have any worries and we are all helping each other. The PHE’s Chief Nurse, Viv Bennett, says: Parents can be reassured that to maximise safety in schools, an extremely stringent system of controls has been advised by PHE and is published in DfE guidance. Evidence so far indicates that schools do not appear to be a primary driver of coronavirus infections in the community. Globally, children and young people have been found to experience coronavirus asymptomatically or as a minor illness.  The Government’s new Wellbeing for Education Return package has training and resources for teachers and young people to protect their wellbeing and mental health. Now the NHS Test and Trace system is up and running and there’s more understanding about what needs to be done to stay safer. Children should stay at homethey have any symptoms such as a fever, continuous cough or loss of taste and smell. If there is an outbreak at a school or college, local health protection teams will work with staff to agree what action is needed. Schools shouldn’t need to close fully, butthey do there’ll be a contingency plan in place to make sure children’s education continues. It’s vital that young peopleto school and college for their educational progress, mental wellbeing and wider development, so attendance is mandatory from the beginning of the new school year. For post-, attendance is important becausea student doesn’t turn up their college may believe they’ve left the course. Schools and colleges have put in a raft of measures to keep pupils and staff safe, including staggered start and finish times and lunch breaks, one-way systems, extra cleaning and encouraging regular handwashing. Where it’s dficult to maintain social distancing, with younger children, contact between groups or “bubbles” will be limited. This means things will look a little dferent, soparents or young people are anxious or worried about ing, they should have a chat with teachers. Parents with younger children are encouraged to take up a nursery place because it provides a routine and helps them develop their social skills. The Government offers a wide range of financial support for families with children aged up to , including Tax-Free Childcare worth up to £, per child per year and you can also apply for a  hours free childcare place before  August.

Emilea Hilton, , was reportedly cruelly taunted by a gang of teenagers while with friends at Parsonage Retail Park in Leigh, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday. Emilea was verbally abused by the group, who singled her out for wearing dark clothes and having dyed hair. According to the teenageraposs mum, Nicola Hilton, her daughter and pals were first approached by a teenage girl and a boy on a bike, before more teenagers arrived shortly afterwards. She was called a aposgothapos and was shoved into a table, Nicola claimed. Emilea left at pm happy, she got herself ready - her black, leather skirt, netted tights, Doc Martens, Nicola told the Manchester Evening News. Everything was fine like always. When she came home and went through the ordeal, my heart was broken. There was a girl and a lad on a bike, they went to Emilea and her friends and said aposwhat do you think youaposre wearing  Why are you dressed like that apos. The mum added: Then from nowhere,  more appeared and backed the girl up. Emilea and her friends ran to Costa Coffee, but the gang followed them and just carried on. The things they shouted - aposyouaposre a goth, look at your hair, do you want a hairbrush apos They all stood laughing and they pushed her onto the table and shouted at her aposshow us your wristsapos. They carried on laughing and taunting her while she was on the floor crying. She was made to lt up her sleeves to show the crowd. They said to my daughteraposs friends aposwhy are you hanging around with her and look at that apos. Just horrible things they did to her, she had to go through them for about  minutes as they followed her around. It was probably the worst half an hour of her le. The incident has left Emilea distraught, Nicola said. I think this will torment her now - sheaposs already told me that she doesnapost want to go out again, she added. The minute she got in the house, she got my straighteners and started straightening her hair. Sheaposs got curly hair, sheaposs never used them in her le. This has really affected her. They have gone out to target girls who look dferent to embarrass and degrade them. Iaposm just so upset for her, Iaposve not slept because Iaposve been so worried about how itaposs going to affect my daughter. Itaposs not the physical things, when they pushed her to the ground, itaposs the embarrassment she felt when they all laughed and targeted her for the way she looks because she was in dark clothes and her hair is died. They called her a goth and they targeted her because she dressed dferently.

Organisers of illegal gatherings of more than  people can now be fined up to £, after new measures were brought into place on Friday. People taking part in illegal raves, unlicensed music events or any other unlawful gatherings of  people or more now face a £ fine. However, revellers continued to flout the guidelines this weekend with several raves going ahead - one in South Wales attracted over , people from all over the UK. Thousands of young people descended on the village of Banwen with locals saying they had been kept awake by loud music since am. Chief Superintendent Simon Belcher, of South Wales Police, said: This type of illegal gathering is totally unacceptable and we are aware of the concerns it is causing for the local community.  I would like to again remind people of their obligations under the current coronavirus legislation and the overarching goal for everyone to take personal responsibility by following Welsh Government regulations to Keep Wales Safe.We have a number of resources in attendance including the police helicopter and roads policing officers. It has been estimated there are up to , people at the gathering who have apparently travelled from across the UK and we are looking at all pieces of legislation as to what action can be undertaken safely. Unlawfully parked cars will be dealt with and people who continue, despite our advice to try and attend this illegal event area being turned away. Norfolk Constabulary said more than  people were in attendance at another rave with more than  vehicles at the site in Thetford Forest. Officers were called at about .pm on Saturday, August  after a member of the public reported seeing large numbers of cars queuing to access a fire route. They discovered the event taking place in an isolated area of the forest, near to Grimes Graves, a Neolithic flint mining English heritage site. The force said paramedics were also called to the scene following reports a man had become unwell. Assistant Chief Constable Nick Davison said: Weaposve deployed a number of resources to the scene including the drone unit, dogs, the National Police Air Service helicopter and specially trained public order officers who are experienced in dealing with such events. Following assessments, itaposs clear this is a well-established and planned event which is due to go on until tomorrow. We are working to close the event down in a controlled manner, taking the safety of those in attendance and our officers into account. Due to the number of people at the event, additional policing resources will be needed and this will take time to resource. Coronavirus is still with us and continues to be a real threat so itaposs extremely disappointing to see these types of events taking place when the rest of our communities are doing everything they can to help stop the spread of the virus.

The Met Office said that although the bank holiday has been unseasonably cool, the low temperatures are not expected to break any records. The mercury will struggle to exceed C in London though, with sunshine in short supply. The chilly spell is in stark contrast to last yearaposs late August Bank Holiday Monday which was the hottest on record, when the mercury hit .C at Heathrow airport. Alex Burkill, meteorologist at the Met Office, said that the iety of hot, cold and windy weather would likely not be reflected in the monthly averages. Weaposve not broken any records with how cold itaposs got, he said. Daytime temperaturesdid struggle, but the lowest maximum temperature was .C and the record is .C, so weaposre quite far off that. Monday daytime temperatures will struggle again, probably only just about getting into double figures in some places, but Iaposd be surprisedwe broke any records. It has been quite extreme at times, weaposve had some very hot weather and then the two storms towards the end of the month, he said.  Even this bank holiday has been unseasonably cool, itaposs not that often that we get temperatures around freezing in August.  has brought everything this month and thataposs not really going to be captured in the monthly averages. Theyaposre not going to show the extremes that weaposve had. Last week, the UK was battered by Storm Francis, which saw gusts of mph hit The Needles near the Isle of Wight, just days after Storm Ellen had struck.  The Met said it was unseasonable to have two named storms occur in August within such a short period. Itaposs not that usual for us to get these types of storms in August, in fact itaposs the first time weaposve ever had a named storm in August, said Mr Burkill.

Beaches were deserted yesterday as chilly weather hit the country, but some people still went out to enjoy their weekend. Next week however will see warmer temperatures, particularly across the south of England. Forecasters predict temperatures could be around C during the week - warmer than this weekend.The Met Office predicts “rain across northern and eastern parts at the beginning of the period will die out leaving much of the country dry for a time.“Further rain and strong winds may develop across northern and western areas through the beginning of September. “Southern and eastern areas are more likely to remain drier with bright or sunny spells.” Tomorrow, Brits are set to experience the coldest August Bank Holiday Monday on record with frost following a weekend washout. But from Tuesday, temperatures are likely to improve with clear skies and sunny intervals across much of England and Wales.  The mercury looks set to reach highs of C in London, with the rest of the UK reaching the high teens. However, a northwest-southeast split is expected, with unsettled weather more confined to the northern regions of the UK. The warmer temperatures will continue through Wednesday, with highs of C forecast along the East of England.  On Thursday afternoon, the mercury is expected to reach C in the South East. From Friday, however, temperatures will start to drop again, with high pressure moving in. The North West of the UK is expected to experience the worst of the weather. Last yearaposs August Bank Holiday Monday was the hottest on record, with .C recorded at Heathrow.  A Met Office spokesperson told : We could potentially see one of the coldest late Bank Holiday Mondays on record in certain parts of the UK. Whether we reach record cold temperatures or not, it is still a big dference compared to last year when we had the hottest late August Bank Holiday on record at .C. According to The Met Office, the coldest late August Bank Holiday in England was recorded in Malham Tarn in northern Yorkshire in  when temperatures reached .C. Also in , the record was set in Northern Ireland when maximum temperatures reached .C in Parkmore Forest, and in Wales when temperatures reached a maximum .C in Alwen.

But almost  years after her £.m lottery win, Elaine Thompson refuses to give up her beloved job stacking supermarket shelves.Despite being vulnerable due to her asthma, she continued to carry on her job as a key worker throughout the coronavirus lockdown, starting her shts at am. The -year-old Marks  Spencer worker told the Newcastle Chronicle : I did the am starts every day so Iaposm in from am to am.The company was fantastic. They let me go at .am because Iaposm asthmatic and Iaposm vulnerable so I was not with any of the customers. I was leaving the house at .am every morning, getting up at midnight. A couple of times during lockdown it was really really hard. I was driving to work thinking aposWhat am I doing apos But I kept working all the way through. I could not have done furlough. Iaposm coming up to  next week but Iaposm not ready to retire yet. When Elaine and husband Derek discovered they had become millionaires in December , their two children, Gary and Karen were only five and  years old. It was then that Elaine decided she would carry on working regardless of her bank balance, so she could be a role model to her children.  Elaine, who lives in Killingworth, a town just north of Newcastle in North Tyneside, said: I had two young children at the time when I made the decision. Itaposs important that children see you working hard, and that we donapost get anything out of le unless you work hard for it. She hoped to inspire her children to be the first in the family to go to university, which they later achieved. The couple will celebrate  years since their lottery win this year, on the same date they celebrate their wedding anniversary. Although she and semi-retired accountant husband Derek, , donapost currently have any plans, they often like to visit Las Vegas on holiday. Aside from dozens of trips to Vegas, the couple also helped out Gary, , and Karen, , to buy their first houses and get on the property ladder.  One of the first things they splashed out on after winning was a new Ford Fiesta and later they bought three racehorses. But the early supermarket shts four days a week help to keep Elaine grounded. People ask me why I have not got a cleaner. If she came to clean, I would have cleaned the house before she got here. For me, I was brought up to be a hard worker, I love to work. I have got the best job in the world, she added. Elaine added: I absolutely love my job and just because I won the lottery, this didn’t make me want to give up work. I think it is all about balance. I have continued to work but work hours which are more suited to me and with the remainder of the time I have been able to help out at and support charities which are close to me.

The race is on to immunise the world against Covid-, which has already killed over , people, but scientists have warned politicians and commercial companies to be cautious. Without comprehensive results showing at least -% effectiveness, vaccines risk doing more harm than good, they claim.On Friday, ministers unveiled a raft of measures designed to fast track the roll-out of any potential coronavirus vaccine in the UK. The temporary law change could see any vaccine given a green light to be dished out to Brits without going through the usual product approval system. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Scientists at Oxford developing a vaccine have said they hope to have something ready for regulators to examine before .While US president Donald Trump wants a vaccine before the presidential election in November.However, Professor Sir Richard Peto, of Oxford University and an adviser to the World Health Organization, said an initial vaccine with low efficacy would lower the bench mark and lead to even more inferior ones down the line. He told : I think there’s a big rush, a somewhat nationalistic rush and also somewhat capitalistic rush as well, to be absolutely first to register a vaccine, and it will actually make it more dficult to evaluate other vaccines.While admitting a vaccine is needed soon, he added: We really do need quite strong evidence of efficacy. Downing Streetaposs plan for emergency measures to ensure it could licence a vaccine this year would override any approval from the European Medicines Agency.  Post-Brexit, however, the UK will be free to license its own vaccines and drugs. Prof Peto is a member of the WHOaposs Solidarity Vaccines Trial Expert Group, which last week warned a poor vaccine could be worse than none at all.The group told - fulltext\" rel\"nofollow\"the Lancet medical journal:  Deployment of a weakly effective vaccine could actually worsen the Covid- pandemicauthorities wrongly assume it causes a substantial reduction in risk, orvaccinated iniduals wrongly believe they are immune, hence reducing implementation of, or compliance with, other Covid- control measures.They went on to say they favoured the Solidarity trials, which compare numerous vaccines from around the world as part of a shared control group, rather than inidual trials. The UK government has insisted that any drug will only be passedit meets the highest safety and quality standards and it will put reinforced safeguards in place.

Paul Charles is CEO of travel consultancy The PC Agency which has correctly predicted the weekly government review for the past three weeks.He said Portugal is on the brink of being in the red zone for the UK quarantine list after a sharp rise in coronavirus cases.The warning came just days after the country was added to the UK government’s travel corridor.  Portugal cases increase again, putting it on the brink of the red zone for #quarantine by Saturday morning, Mr Charles tweeted. According to The PC Agency data, on Sunday Portugal recorded . cases per , people over the previous seven days. The UK has said nations will be taken off the travel corridor list once this figure rises above . Mr Charles told the  Daily Mail : It will need to see a miracle drop in case numbers by Thursday to avoid being added again to the Governmentaposs on-off quarantine list as it is quickly veering into the red zone.He added that Portugal is a victim of its own success in attracting so many tourists rapidly, with Skyscanner reporting a , percent increase in bookings from the UK since the travel corridor was added on August . An estimated , Brits are either in the country or due to fly there. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has warned holidaymakers that quarantine rules can change rapidly.  On Thursday Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic were stripped from the safe list, meaning people arriving in the UK from those countries after am on Saturday now need self-isolate for two weeks.

The young girl, whose surname was Lin, was at the  International Kite Festival in the city when a kite with a long strip was blown violently by the wind. This kite somehow became tangled around Linaposs stomach and she was pulled into the sky.Lin is thankfully ok, only suffering minor scratches according to Taiwan News, but it was terrying for everyone.A video shared on social media seems to show the girl swinging in the air for a few seconds before someone pulled the kite down. She was pretty high up, and the video shows her twisting through the air as shocked onlookers canapost believe what theyaposre seeing. There was lots of screaming and shouting, but thankfully a group of people caught the girl when she fell. Lin was then sent to hospital by staff at the event with her mum for a check over, although as reported, she was ok."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/5ea069f6bd65c7.44624732-scaled.jpg ","title":"no evidence of coronavirus transmission in the community says top tayside doctor","story":"A top doctor has said there is “no evidence” of coronavirus being transmitted in the community in Tayside.This comes after two separate outbreaks at the  Sisters chicken factory in Coupar Angus and at Kingspark School in Dundee.NHS Tayside bosses also highlighted the risk of too many people showing up for testing because they are overly-anxious about having the virus, now that schools are back.At a meeting of the board this week, Dr Emma Fletcher, associate director of public health, said there had been #extensive# testing and contact tracing in connection with both outbreaks.She said: “Public health continues to monitor the situation across Tayside and as a precaution we have taken the dficult decision to pause indoor care home visits because of the signicant vulnerability of these residents should an outbreak occur in a care home setting.“There has been an exceptional effort from the contact tracing team who have been able to chart all new cases and their associations across Tayside.“Despite the few outbreaks, there is no evidence of community transmission at this point which gives us confidence, but we are aware it is a dynamic situation.”Concerns had also been raised at the meeting over the capacity of Tayside’s coronavirus testing facilities due to an increased demand.Emma-Jane Wells, who sits on the NHS board, said: “We have heard reports about an increase in demand for testing and issues with home testing kits, and in Dundee there is only a drive-in testing facility which is an issue for people who don’t drive.“As a parent myself we are already seeing colds in circulation with children going back to school and now there are concerns over the availability of testing.”Dr Drew Walker, the outgoing director of public health at NHS Tayside, said: “The whole test and protect programme is absolutely critical to handling our emergence from lockdown and moving on with normality, but the testing aspect of that is proving challenging.“We are working very closely with the Scottish Government to make sure those who need tests can access them.”Grant Archibald, chief executive of the health board, added: “Mobile units have been sent to the  Sisters factory, Broxden in Perth and one to Forfar and people are being tested very quickly.“We need to make sure we manage to test those who need it and not the worried well.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

in the Europa League first qualying round on Thursday.Welsh international Ryan Hedges was rewarded for a hat-trick after coming on as a substitute against Runavik with a recall to the starting line-up, while defender Tommie Hoban was also promoted from the bench.Dylan McGeouch and Curtis Main both dropped to the bench.Hibs created the opening opportunity in the first minute when Joe Lewis spilled a simple cross from Joe Newell.It was so unlike captain Lewis and the loose ball fell to Martin Boyle, who fluffed it by shooting tamely at the keeper.In the th minute, Lewis was again called into action when left-back Josh Doig unleashed a vicious right-footed drive from  yards.Keeper Lewis pushed it over at his top left corner.Moments later, Lewis saved again from Boyle’s angles strike.Aberdeen threatened with a neat one-two between Scott Wright and Hedges that ripped open the defence.Hedges# powerful low shot from  yards was blocked by keeper Ofir Marciano.The Dons were beginning to control midfield and dictate the pace of play.In the rd minute Marley Watkins fired in a low drive from the edge of the penalty area, but  Marciano got down well to block.Aberdeen went ahead in the th minute with Watkins at the heart of the action.The on-loan Bristol City striker chased down Boyle deep inside the Hibs box as he readied to clear.Boyle was unaware of Watkins closing down on him and caught him with his swiped clearance.Referee Nick Walsh rightly awarded a penalty.In the - defeat of Runavik on Thursday, Lewis Ferguson stepped aside from penalty-taking duties in favour of Hedges to allow him to get a hat-trick.This time FERGUSON was back on the spot and sent Marciano the wrong way.It was the first time this season Hibs had fallen behind.Early in the second half, Kennedy burst into the penalty area, but Marciano saved his shot.Hibs threatened in the st minute when Drey Wright burst in behind the Dons defence and fired a dangerous cross along the face of goal, but there were no takers.In the nd minute, substitute Main drilled in a low -yard drive, but keeper Marciano got down well to block.In injury time, Doidge met a corner kick at the back post, but headed wide.ABERDEEN: Joe Lewis, Tommie Hoban, Andy Considine, Scott McKenna, Ryan Hedges, Jonny Hayes, Lewis Ferguson, Scott Wright, Matty Kennedy, Ross McCrorie, Marley Watkins.Subs: Dylan McGeouch , Curtis Main ,  Niall McGinn .Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Shay Logan, Funso Ojo,  Ash Taylor,  Connor McLennan, Ronald Hernandez.HIBS: Marciano, Hanlon, Porteous, McGinn, Wright, Doidge, Boyle, Newell, Hallberg, Allan, Doig.Subs: Murphy , Mallan .Subs not used: Dabrowski, Gray, Murray, Stevenson, Gullan, McGregor, Stirling.Referee: Nick WalshFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles. The Bikeability scheme gives children and adults the confidence to ride out safely.#The training, over three days, and was a mixture of games, exercises and on road practice, finishing with an assessment. The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

They came back positive and cheerful they followed all the new guidance and protocols with no problem and are just getting on with it in the way that Lochgilphead children do.Scottish Government guidance does not require social distancing in academic classes but Miss Devine emphasised the measures taken by the school.#We have stringent protocols in place for movement around the campus, using single file.

They have kept in touch and supported the school throughout lockdown and over the arrangements. Obviously they are glad to see the children getting back to some sort of normality in schooling, but they have trusted us with the arrangements to safeguard the children and I feel very lucky to have that support.#Faced with a constantly changing picture, both locally and nationally, Miss Devine commented: #It is challenging to respond to that and keep lines of communication open with parents. Argyll and Bute Council has been good at giving guidelines to schools and that has helped a lot.#The council has also supplied hand sanitiser, face masks, gloves and visors and, said Miss Devine, the school is prepared to deal with anyone displaying symptoms.#We have thermometers in the school and we would testwe had concerns about a child becoming ill. There are straightforward guidelines that when a child displays symptoms they should be isolated and taken home immediately.#She added: #As yet we haven#t haven#t had to put those measures into practice.#In the event of a pupil being unable to attend school, Miss Devine confirmed that the online teaching s have been retained #as a safety net#.Miss Devine concluded: #Everybody is having to get used to the new health and safety protocols, but thus far people feel well supported.

distancing, where possible.\"In situations where there is a local cluster, use of face coverings throughout the day may be required.ldquoThe position will be kept under review to ensure that our

This magnicent pair of munros has its own pinnacle ridge called the Horns of Alligin.Sitting on the seaward side of Torridon it has an unmatched viewpoint with glimpses of Skye and the sea to one side, and great peaks on the other side with the Horns providing a stunning foreground.The Munro is around km and takes around - hours.Beinn Alligin Torridon, Alligin, AchnasheenBuachaille Etive Mor, Glen CoeBuachaille Etive Mor is the head of Glen Coe and reigns supreme with its awe-inspiring pyramidal appearance. It is affectionately known by many climbers as the Bookie and, along with its twin Buachaille Etive Beag, are among the most photographed of the Scottish mountains and itrsquos easy to see why!This Munro is perfect for those who want a climb and some incredible views.It is around km and takes around - hours to complete.Aonach Eagach Ridge, A, Ballachulish PH HXLiathach, TorridonAnother of Torridonrsquos three mountains, Liathach is perhaps the finest of them all. Its higher Munro looks almost inaccessible from most directions and even the easiest ascent involves a bit of scrambling but itrsquos certainly worth the effort.Beyond this point the mountain becomes even more dramatic and offers the perfect path for thrill seekers to climb to the top. The hidden north side of the mountain is even more spectacular and is well worth exploring.Slightly longer than the other of Torridonrsquos mountains this walk is around .km and takes around - hours.Achnasheen, IV ETLiathachSgurr nan Gillean, SkyeMany regard Sgurr nan Gillean as being the finest peak on Skye and it is one of the more dficult on this list. Even the easiest ascent on the southeast ridge is a pretty tough scramble ndash the other two ridges venturing into the realm of rock climbing.It appears fairly dramatic from Sligachan but this actually conceals much of the mountainrsquos finest features and its only upon a closer visit to Coire a Bhasteir that the true scale and magnicence of the Pinnacle Ridge reveals this Munrorsquos true stature.This walk is around km and takes roughly  to  hours to complete.Skye, IV SW"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-maskne-seven-ways-look-skin-wearing-masks","story":"Facemasks are gradually becoming the new norm in our everyday lives with the coverings helping protect us and those around us.However, people wearing face coverings every day have been noticing that they have started to break out in acne, rashes and skin irritations.Have you had more breakouts since you started wearing a mask We have spoken to Dermalogica skin care expert and beautician Ashley Richards to find out why this happens and how you can protect your skin.What is ldquomaskne Maskne occurs when sweat, oil and bacteria are trapped on your skin while wearing a mask, creating the perfect breeding ground for breakouts.What causes it Maskne is caused by friction, rubbing, and occlusion of the skin by outside forces.Wearing a mask can trap dirt, oil, swear and humidity around the skin.Friction and irritation from the mask pushes bacteria into the skin, which creates micro-tears, and allows the bacteria and dirt to enter the skin more easily.This will lead to blackheads and whiteheads along the bridge of your nose, cheeks and chin. Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.,params: .pushUsing hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-mobile-testing-unit-hawick---know","story":"A MOBILE-TESTING unitwill run in Hawick for six days, according to NHS Borders.It comes following an outbreak in the townlinked to three businesses.The testing unit will operate from tomorrowuntil Wednesday, September .It will be based in the Teviotdale Leisure Centre car park on Mansfield Road, with tests available between pm-pm.An NHS Borders spokesperson said: \"The MTU can only take a limited number of people each day so it is essential that only people with COVID- symptoms book a test.\"Other household members must self-isolate but should not be tested unless they too are showing any symptoms.\"The symptoms of COVID- are a high temperature or fever a new continuous cough or a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.\"Tests, which must be booked in advance, can be arranged by visiting this websiteor calling  .The new unit will run alongside the existing facility in Galashiels Netherdale car park, which will operate betweenam and pm.If travellingto a mobile unit is not possible, people can arrange for a home test kit to be posted through their door.NHS Borders jointdirector of public health, Tim Patterson, said: \"I realise that people in Hawick will have concerns about the virus as a result of this outbreak.\"Unfortunately this can lead to the circulation of unsubstantiated rumours, especially on social media.\"I would like to re-iterate that it is crucial for everyone in the community to follow our advice and avoid speculation and rumour about the outbreak.\"Dr Patterson added: \"In terms of schools, all education settings in Hawick are currently safe places for children to learn.\"Unless your child has been asked to self-isolate by NHS Borders Test and Protect team they should attend school as normal.\"However it remains vital that no child attends schoolthey are displaying any COVID- symptoms.\"At the time of publication, a total of nine new cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders in recent days,bringing the regions total to  since the outbreak began.To book a testing unit appointment or a free home testing kit, visit: www.gov.uk get-coronavirus-test or you can call:   "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"In the last week, demands for Covid testing in Scotland have surged.The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.When should you take a test If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

It was the sound of their wings that caught my attention before I saw them. It was a lockdown morning, no traffic, no background sound, and they were flying low.I never have been much of a bird watcher well, what I mean is I have always loved sightings of wildle, including birds, but donrsquot sit for hours to spot dferent types. I know the names of some birds but many I canrsquot identy with certainty. My friend Jim is my human encyclopaedia for such things.Of course, we can still appreciate nature and wildle without being able to identy their exact names. A beautul tree is still worthy of admiration, evenyou donrsquot knowitrsquos an oak or a sycamore. You can enjoy the antics of a flock of birds, evenyoursquore not surethey are martins or swts.And there are some wild creatures we all know and can identy: a fox, a robin, a hedgehog, a squirrel, a rabbit, a mole, a deer, a dandelion, a daisy, a heron, a swan, a duck and a hare would be on this list, but itrsquos not as extensive as it used to be. As nature has receded from our lived experiences, so has the ability to identy and name much of the wildle and plants that survive around us.The beautully illustrated book The Lost Words by Jackie Morris and Robert MacFarlane was a response to this loss of nature vocabulary. With beautul pictures and poems, it brings back to le some of the animals and flora of our land. And resources like the ranger service do a fantastic job in our county, providing walks, giving fascinating information and talking to a iety of groups.But itrsquos the lived experience of nature that is the vital link between having knowledge and developing an understanding that will nurture a love of our natural environment. We cannot really love that which we do not experience and value personally. Itrsquos when we physically encounter a plant or animal that we develop a desire to know its name and understand its signicance.This seems a perfect time to find ways to enhance that lived experience of nature. In schools, because of the presence of Covid, learning outdoors as much as possible is being promoted. Some schools will have access to woodland or natural areas more than others. Some schools in built-up areas will be more restricted. But even in urban areas, there may be a grassy area with a tree or two, or perhaps a nature corner can be created.Teachers do a great job, and they are doing so in very challenging circumstances just now they know their business. But as a storyteller who until the lockdown was in schools every week telling stories, I am unable to do so in these new circumstances. I fully understand why, of course.But as things develop, it may be possible for storytelling to take place outdoors, wersquoll see. For me this is not so much a restriction but a new opportunity to make nature the stage, with listeners immersed in the natural surroundings in which so many stories are set. Evenonly concrete playground is currently available, there is potential to make more of the outdoor space now that it will be used in a dferent way.As I say, time will tell what will be possible. My interest is not just as a storyteller but also as a parent. Itrsquos a time to be cautious and safe, yes, but let us not forget the vital importance of the creative arts in all this. Many children have missed out on so much already, and music, song, storytelling and drama are such a vital part of childrenrsquos development and soul indeed for us all. Perhaps we all need to relearn the campfire spirit, around which so much human culture and understanding developed.And so my thoughtsto the swts which flew over my garden. They will now be flying over Africa, following the rains and chasing the insects there. Their story is utterly fascinating a lesson in natural and human history, as well as geography, biology and ecology.Soon the pink-footed geese from Iceland will arrive in their honking formations, to spend their winter here. Irsquove noticed some trees are showing they already feel the nip of autumn. The cycle of naturersquos stories are all around us,we have an ear to listen and eye to notice.More learning outdoors is a gt.

Ms Sturgeon may be self-assured on TV, but that wont run the NHS and educate our children in an independent Scotland.Martin Redfern, Melrose.I HAVE observed many political leaders come and go over the years, in the UK, the United States and where, among them JFK, Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, right up to the present day.The present incumbents I believe are most certainly the worst and least able. At local, Scottish, level we are governed by one-issue-obsessed nationalists. Forget the \"civicrsquorsquo appellation beloved of the SNP. Nationalism is like a cancer, there are dferent kinds, but the basic illness is exactly the same. It is in effect tribalism and an appeal to the worst instincts in humans.None of this is helped by the rampant narcissism and rabble-rousing displayed by the SNPrsquos leaders, past and present.At UK level, we have Boris Johnson, and in the US, Donald Trump, both at times approach the buffoon level. Both are lacking the intellect and political skill to govern wisely.I fear for my children and grandchildren in this \"brave new worldrsquo.rsquoAlexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.IT IS WRONG THAT SALMOND IS STILL ON TRIALIAIN Macwhirter suggests that while Alex Salmond has been found not guilty by a jury of his peers, he remains on trial . Of course he is. The story of a colleague suggesting that Nye Bevan was ldquohis own worst enemy, being met with the comment by Ernest Bevin, ldquonot while Irsquom around he ainrsquot is instructive in thatwe substitute Salmond for Bevan and much of the Scottish media for Bevin, the situation is much the same.Mr Salmond enjoys a fantastic degree of loyalty from his supporters, much to the astonishment of his opponents, some within the SNP. But the not guilty verdict has been greeted in some circles with ldquohe got away with it. This is most ably demonstrated by the last words in Kirsty Warkrsquos recent ldquodocumentary on the trial going to one of the women whose case did not convince the jury of Mr Salmondrsquos guilt.Moreover, bear in mind the Moorov doctrine, which says ldquo that the evidence of one witness can corroborate the evidence of another in certain situationsthe Crown can prove that the accuseds offending was part of a course of conduct, systematically pursued. This can address dficulties of proving rape or other sexual offences, where there is no corroborating evidence, by showing a pattern of behaviour over a period of time. However, while there were  charges for the jury to consider, with certain features in common ndash the involvement of alcohol, being alone with Mr Salmond ndash the jury chose not to convict. Therefore, is the conclusion not that the jury were unconvinced by the womenrsquos versions of events not just inidually but collectively as well Mr Macwhirter concludes ldquothat you are guilty even when you are found innocent. Early in her ldquodocumentary Ms Wark speaks of the ldquowomenrsquos stories, but without convincing evidence that is what they remain ndash stories. The Carl Beech case, though I am not associating any of Mr Salmondrsquos accusers with him, is a prescient warning of where justice being based on ldquostories without convincing evidence can lead. We cannot have a legal system that accepts something is true just because the accuser says it is.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SONGS THAT SHOULD BE CHERISHEDWHAT a pointless brouhaha created by the BBC so unnecessarily over those two rousing tunes which bring such a resounding climax to the Proms.If ever we needed the feelgood factor in our lives, it is today, in the midst of a pandemic and the gloomy prospect of economic woe.What better way to raise the spirits of any community than with powerful community singing which comes across even from our TV screens as energising, defiant and uplting Those tunes provide a marvellous send-off to the traditional finale of the last night of the revered Proms.Yes, Britain did have an empire, which like any endeavour contained elements both good and the bad.Maybe we should recall those words of a well-known holy man, \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone\".Again while the lyrics of the songs were written in a dferent era with a dferent outlook ,they take on a fresh new meaning, outside of nostalgiafor every new generation.No one can quarrel surely with the sentiment that Britons shall never be slaves when that applies to all our compatriots regardless of their origins, colour or creed.Let the BBC reinstate the choral singing of those tunes which it has downgraded out of a weird and faux concern over political correctness.There are some traditions we should always cherish and this is one of them.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.DEPORTATION IS THE ANSWERDOUGLAS Robinsonchooses to reduce the important topic of illegal immigration to that of a pub discussion.He is obviously a Europhile. Mr Robinson misses the whole point about UK sanctions on France, since the Yellow Vests would riot on the streets demanding Emmanuel Macron stopped the migrant flow to the UK. Britain can get food from where delivered to our door.More than , asylum seekers, paying large sums of money, have illegally entered the UK this year. Following the death of -year-old Sudanese migrant Abdulfatah Hamdallah on a beach in France, the usual suspects have been rushing to blame Britain. After leaving Sudan he and his friend Gamr Alsha were in Italy and France, so under EU \"safe haven\" rules they should have claimed asylum there and Abdulfatah would not have died. The , who travelled through numerous \"safe havens\" in Europe should quickly be deported and this would deter others from risking their lives.Clark Cross, Linlithgow.MASKING THE DANGERSTHERE is much talk in the media currently on whether people should wear masks in ious situations.Inevitably most people wear cheap masks, and the fact that my glasses steam up, and that when I seal a cheap medical mask around my mouth I almost cant breathe, suggest that my breaths are taking the path of least resistance and going round the edges of the mask unfiltered.There are several research papers on the effectiveness of mask wearing, and perhaps the most interesting one is from  which claims to be the only study on cloth masks to that date. Lead-authored by C Raina MacIntyre, it could not have had any preconceived notions on Covid-. The study says ldquofiltration was extremely poorfor the cloth masks and ldquopoor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.Danger is the illusion of safety.Geoff Moore, Alness.CLOSED CURTAINTHERE was a lot of talk last week about the Rangers ldquoIron Curtain Defence of the late Forties  early Fties . This was Brown Young, Shaw McCall, Woodburn and Cox. There were no substitutes then and no thought of squad rotation. When one of the five outfield defenders was injured, Willie Rae came in at left half and the others were moved around as necessary. Young could play at full back or centre half and Cox could play anywhere. So for other defenders at the club, the Iron Curtain meant they could not get a game.

In a democracy, there comes a point where the majority says enough is enough and change becomes inevitable.Bill Calder, Galashiels.THERE has never been an economic case for independence. Never. To suggest so is to digny the SNP with an undeserved gravitas. Its ldquocase is based solely on a misplaced romantic view of themselves, as relevant as Morris Dancers and historical re-enactment groups are to UK foreign policy.Devolution was for sure a concession too far by the UK Government. It has been an unmitigated failure, and Holyrood is an appalling waste of public money that has failed in every area of its limited responsibility. Along the way it has legitimised an agenda of hate and politicised everything in public le, including local government, to the detriment of us all. Enough already. Game over.John Dunlop, Ayr.TO accept Peter Russellrsquos argument that the Vow was deliveredrequires a lack of awareness of the reality of the UKrsquos constitution, and in particular that the House of Commons is sovereign, possessing supreme or ultimate power. For instance, there is nothing to prevent the repeal of the Sections of the  Scotland Act which Mr Russell puts his faith in. Similarly, the Barnett Formula could be brought to an end by a vote in the House of Commons, and with  of  MPs at Westminster, there is little we could do about it.Ah, but they wouldnrsquot do this, comes the reply. They are bound by the Vow. But with UK indebtedness at something like pound trillion the temptation to cut spending in this way must be great for a Conservative Government with little support here already.With regard to ldquoextensive powers devolved, letrsquos suppose the powers were ldquoextensive as Mr Russell asserts. However, we already know Westminsterrsquos intentions with regard to the ldquoSingle British Market will mean Scottish food regulations can be undermined by the requirement of ldquomutual recognition. In any event, it would always be open to Westminster to legislate to amend regulations passed at Holyrood. As Enoch Powell said, ldquopower devolved is power retained, because it can always be taken back again.Thus to consider the Vow without consideration of the context within which it will operate, is, to put it at its best, limited. His reticence to do this is though easily understood.Lastly, Mr Russell disapproves of others ldquotelling lies, but the fact is his claimed Commission opinion about Scotlandrsquos membership position never existed, as this would only have been forthcoming to the political head of state of a member country. It might be interesting to learn why David Cameron never did get round to asking that question. Thus, Mr Russellrsquos claim that, had Scotland voted Yes, we would have left the EU on independence, is based on no more than the opinion of inidual Commissioners writing in a personal capacity.While Mr Russell may, as I do, deprecate anyone telling lies, his letter reveals a careful selection of the truth.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.CATRIONA Stewart thinks Douglas Ross ldquois right, we need to learn to disagree.

Barring his removal agrave la Carlaw, he will have been in post  days.He overtook Johann Lamontrsquos thankless -day slog this week, and has now been in charge longer than Wendy Alexander and Kezia Dugdale combined, and almost six times as long as Jim lsquoThe Mayflyrsquo Murphy.Only Iain Grayrsquos -day peak remains to conquer, and when he gets to that pinnacle, imagine the view.When Mr Leonard became leader at the height of the Jeremy Corbyn fad, Scottish Labour had seven MPs after winning , votes and . per cent support in the  election.Under Mr Leonard - and Mr Corbyn of course - six of those MPs and , votes were lost just two years later, and the partyrsquos support fell to .% in Scotland.The same year, Scottish Labour also lost both its MEPs in the European election, when the party fell from second place to fth, as its vote sank from .% to just .%.The panorama of pain visible from Mr Leonardrsquos summit would also take in the imminent Holyrood election.In , his party won  MSPs with .% of the vote in constituencies and % on the list.The most recent YouGov poll suggests a quarter of those MSPs will be lost as Labourrsquos support falls to % in both seats and regions.:Watch: lsquoPolitically suicidalrsquo Richard Leonard left red-faced after horror FMQsThe same poll found most Scots barely know who Mr Leonard is. Asked to rate his performance, % said he was doing well, % badly and a whopping % were ldquodonrsquot know.To survive for so long without achievements, profile or prospects is, in its own small way, remarkable.But being Holyroodrsquos answer to moss wasnrsquot the objective.Mr Leonard is meant to be within striking distance of Bute House.After more than , days, itrsquos clear he never will be. He has had his chance and it hasnrsquot worked out. He is not a late bloomer but a dead bulb.Thatrsquos not to say hersquos a bad chap. He is manestly decent and sincere.At his best, he is one of the most commanding speakers at Holyrood.If he raises an injustice at FMQs, his solemn, unadorned phrases have an ability to silence MSPs and make ministers squirm in discomfort.However it is a patchy talent thatrsquos undone by the times he misfires horribly, as he did this week with a stale script and weak comebacks, and was shredded by Nicola Sturgeon.But his biggest problem is his failure to connect with the public. Too cosy talking shop within his own tribe - never get him started on trade union history - he hasnrsquot reached out widely enough to voters, hasnrsquot fought hard enough for their attention.Whatever the message, it needs the right messenger to be heard.As one party source told me more in sorrow than anger: ldquoHersquos making no impact whatsoever. Hersquos got no traction. Hersquos a lovely, intelligent and sharp guy, but I despair at times.Yet he carries on regardless, recently promising that he would lead Scottish Labour into the  election despite the third strike all around him know is inevitable. It will not be a campaign, but a resignation tour.While Ms Sturgeon will be askedshe intends to serve out a full term, few expect Mr Leonard to last the weekend after the votes are counted.:Anneliese Dodds warns Westminster Labour party wont decide Richard Leonards futureDetermination and a thick hide are necessary qualities in a leader, but they are not sufficient ones.Mr Leonardrsquos desire to carry on for the sake of the unions and the Left that elected him is understandable.But without Corbyn, he is a sidekick without a hero, a holdout for a ghost of a project rejected by the electorate. Ultimately it is selfish and lets down those counting on Labour in power, for without a Scottish revival Sir Keir Starmer will struggle to overcome Boris Johnsonrsquos  seat majority.Leaders heading for the exit cannot expect to interest voters, inspire activists or attract talent in the same way as leaders with a future.Jackson Carlaw had the same problem. He was not expected to stick around long after , and many of his key staff were already leaving when Tory HQ brought forward his departure date. Douglas Ross has a better chance of building a fresh team around him than Mr Carlaw ever did.I ask you, who is going to sign up for the last days of Richard Leonard So it falls to Sir Keir to spruce up Scottish Labour in the spring, offering a dferent anti-Tory vote to the SNP.It may not make much dference, but this early in his leadership he can afford to throw himself into the fray and take a few lumps, and therersquos no credit in ducking the fight.Thatrsquos the Prime Ministerrsquos modus operandi north of the border.All is not lost for Scottish Labour however. While Mr Leonard runs down the calendar, party HQ should work up a swt process to replace him, and interested MSPs can use the election to audition for the vacancy.Anas Sarwar is the battle-scarred favourite. He was wholly unprepared for the focus on his personal wealth that helped him lose to Mr Leonard. But he is tougher and cannier now. Monica Lennon may also apply.Although a coffin lid for Mr Leonard, the election could yet prove a shop window for his successor.Let the contest begin."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-view-transparency-matters-public-life","story":"That is a principle that many governments find inconvenient. But the Scottish Government is currently not just in danger of being excessively secretive, but of making itself absurd through its refusal to provide the public with answers to basic questions.The question of when the First Minister first knew that people positive with coronavirus were being discharged into care homes is a matter of urgent public interest. It is not one that compromises the privacy of inidual patients or impinges on the Governmentrsquos ability to make the best decisions. Nor should it be one that requires her to obtain details from Public Health Scotland it is inconceivable that she does not know the answer. She is simply refusing to give it.The assumption must be that it is one that doesnrsquot show her and the Government in the best light. But the refusal to answer is worse than simply admitting as much. Scots are well aware that government is not infallible, and this Government in particular has been afforded a generous degree of latitude for its mistakes. In part, that may be due to the reasonable and realistic recognition of this fact that it presents in its rhetoric.That counts for nothing, however, when its responses ndash or refusals to respond ndash fail to correspond with those public statements. There has been an alarming pattern of behaviour on this front. To take just a few instances, there has been the Queen Elizabeth Hospital inquiry, the reluctance to publish minutes of ministerial meetings, delays to routine Freedom of Information requests, an attempt to sneak out an ICEA report critical of education policy, Audit Scotlandrsquos damning assessment of secrecy surrounding PFI projects, the disgraceful evasion over the role of government and public officials in the inquiry into Alex Salmond ndash after assurances that all such material would be forthcoming ndash and now the ludicrous claim that an effective reaction to the Covid emergency would be constrained by the answer to a simple question about when the Government knew what.All of these obfuscations give little reason for public confidence that an inquiry into coronavirus policy, when it finally comes, will uncover the full picture. The Government gives lip service to statements about how mistakes will undoubtedly have been made it makes glib pronouncements about how important it will be to identy them, and ensure that lessons are learnt so that they are not repeated.But the reality is that it goes to enormous s ndash and often, when the courts are involved, enormous cost to the public purse ndash to avoid answering such questions, far less admit its own failings. That is an unhealthy attitude, corrosive of public confidence and damaging to good governance.Whatrsquos more, given that the electorate is composed of grown-ups and, on current showings, far from censorious, it is a politically foolish and counterproductive one. There are relatively few legitimate reasons, generally to do with security concerns or momentous economic decisions likely to move markets, for government business to be conducted privately. Potential embarrassment to the SNP is not one.The expectation should be that frank disclosure is the norm it benefits the Government by making them seem like fair dealers, it improves policy decisions for the future and, above all, it is a reminder that the public has a right to know, and that politicians should be the peoplersquos servants, rather than the reverse."},{"url":null,"title":"economic-storm-blame-game","story":"The Ross Clark remembers the Thursday nights when everyone gathered on their doorsteps to applaud the NHS workers risking their lives.ldquoThey were putting their own safety aside to work in close proximity with people who were desperately ill with the virus and were coughing it out in copious quantities, he said. ldquoCompared with the risks run by frontline nurses and doctors at the height of the epidemic in March and April the dangers faced by office workers now are miniscule.He asked why so many workers have not ed to the office, pointing out that, in London, just  per cent are back at work.ldquoYou have to wonder what has happened to the nationrsquos productivity given that millions of people used to an office environment suddenly work from home, away from the eyes of their bosses, he said. ldquoProductivity in many organisations has not exactly been impressive since staff started working from home.

Anne and Rob were ordinary, working-class, Ayrshire Scots who didnrsquot have a lot of cash when they were growing up, took a deeply practical view of le, health, and other people, and were wary of salesmen, politicians, and journalists .Like a lot of Scots of their age and experience, Anne and Rob also had several core instincts that drove most of their views. First, they were cautious about spending money unnecessarily. Second, they were wary of change and had generally conservative instincts. Third, they were resistant to governments telling them what to do . And fourth, they had a dual identity that they pretty much took for granted: their Scottishness was their Britishness was their Scottishness.All of these instincts ndash formed and confirmed by the war, and post-war governmentsndash led both Anne and Rob to be deeply suspicious of Scottish nationalism and the people who led it: first Alex Salmond, then Nicola Sturgeon. Salmond, as far as they were concerned, was a blowhard and Sturgeon a troublemaker and a stirrer. In later years, Anne would sit back in her chair after wersquod finished our cups of tea and cakeand say: ldquoSo, tell me, what has that besom been up to now I realise not all of you may feel quite as affectionate about Scots like Anne and Rob as I do: indeed, some of the nastier nationalists on Twitter take great delight in the fact that Scots of Anne and Robrsquos generationare dying out. But, as the law of demographics adjusts the population without pity, and there are fewer Scots like Anne and Rob and more Scots who take dferent views, I canrsquot help feeling a bit down dispirited depressed. The Scotland I know, through people like Anne and Rob, my grannies, my mother, is dying. And I need to accept it.A couple of recent trends have confirmed where things seem to be going. Scots like Anne and Rob were generally thrty ndash my granny in Thurso used to give us felt-tip pens to colour in the bald patches on her rugs so she didnrsquot have to buy new ones ndash and much of their antipathy to Scottish independence came from the realisation that it would be expensive for Scots like them. They would be worse off.However, increasingly, many Scots take a dferent, and more cavalier, view of money. A lot of them have credit cards and overdraftsand the idea of debt, and the cost of debt, is not off-putting to them, which explains why the economic cost of independence is no deterrent. They shrug their shoulders. So what  A Panelbase poll the other day showed that  per cent of Scots believe independence will be good for the Scottish economy.Anne and Robrsquos instinctive caution and suspicion about politicians, especially politicians telling you what to do, is also clearly under threat. Many Scots listen to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos briefings obediently rather than questioningly they are more likely than people in the rest of the UK to wear face masks and to do it zealously, belligerently even they also bristle at criticism of the First Minister. Scots like Anne and Rob may have been conservative, but they werenrsquot conformist. What happened to our antipathy to authority  Itrsquos one of the things I liked about us most.Anne and Robrsquos dual British Scottish identity is also on the way out. I was chatting to a retired coal miner the other day ndash hersquos in his s ndash and it was interesting to see his take on the world. He was passionately anti-Thatcher and is passionately Royalist he is instinctively Scottish and instinctively British. Some nationalists would see those positions as contradictory but theyrsquore not. A lot of Scots feel that way. The problem is a lot of them are in their s and s and wonrsquot be around for much longer.I have to admit that fact does get me down. I accept there are lots of older Scots who support independence . But it seems to me that, as more of the post-war generation dies out, the more we lose the voices of caution and conservatism. Younger Scots are always going to be a bit more relaxed about risk ndash thatrsquos natural ndash but we are losing the Scots who look at the idea of change, and the cost of it, and say: ca canny.The only hope is that some younger voters wonrsquot always be the same as they are now and that, as they get older, their views will moderate and change. Who knows, they may even start to understand the value of Anne and Robrsquos approach to spending money, and to politicians and nationalistic politicians in particular. It sometimes happens as you get older: you see more.But I am not hopeful. Increasingly, when I speak to people under , they feel uncomfortably dferent to many of the Scots I know, and the effect is even more marked when you speak to people under . They are aggressively supportive of Nicola Sturgeon and aggressively attached to Scottishness. They are dismissive of the risks of independence and the benefits of being in a union. I do not like any of this. I think it is a mark of nationalist ideology. I would prefer itmore people thought like Anne and Rob, and my granny, and me. But I can also see that itrsquos happening nonetheless. I cannot change it. I cannot stop it. I must accept it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11754770.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ben-nevis-young-boy-cerebral-palsy-completes-climb-charity","story":"Caeden Thomson, from Corby, Northamptonshire, trekked the , ft ascent to the top of Ben Nevis in the Highlands on Saturday to raise money for his local NHS trust and disability equality charity Scope.Caeden was born  weeks premature and has since undergone intense physiotherapy, but told mum Lisa that he wanted to be able to give something back because ldquohe was so lucky for all the things he has had in his le.:-year-old with cerebral palsy takes on Ben Nevis for charityEarly in his le, Caedenrsquos parents were told he would never walk, sit or talk.Setting out to raise pound,, a crowdfunding page now puts the total at more than pound, as result of the thirteen-hour climb.ldquoCaeden is an absolute legend, mother Lisa said.She added: ldquoIt was such a massive challenge and much, much harder than any of us expected.ldquoThere were many hard times along the way ndash from three-quarters of the way up the pathway is just massive boulders and very hard to climb, and even at the top we didnrsquot think he would make it down.:Utter disbelief as Scottish chip shop customer tries to use Eat Out scheme for weeks worth of dinnersldquoThere were danger areas where carrying was very dficult, so Caeden did have to walk down a lot of it too.

This is only the beginning though.“The plan will evolve and respond to reflect the feedback and the needs of the sector. We are therefore calling for industry to review and contribute to the plan.” The recovery plan is available to view on the CLF website.Feedback can be submitted via the website on enquiries@constructionforum.scot by September .CLF will take all feedback on board to help develop the plan further, with regular updates published on the CLF site.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Over  community initiatives entered and the standards were incredibly high with some fantastic causes coming through.#It’s great to see how passionate these rural communities are and how each of their projects will make such a dference for all those living in the local area.“St Magnus Way’s development and repair is a great initiative and we very much look forward to seeing this stunning country walk become even more accessible to the public in Orkney.”Each entry was judged by four impartial judges who had the extremely dficult task of choosing this year’s winners.They based their decision on the potential impact the project had on the local community, its sustainability once launched, the originality of the project and the projects submission itself.There were three levels of funding available:  £, grants, six £, grants and five £, grants.For further information on the Calor Rural Community Fund and to view the full list of winners, please visit: communityfund.calor leaderboards winners-copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Clare Cushenan started Special Delivery NI last year.She brings gt baskets packed with items for mum and baby to hospitals for new mothers - along with positive and reassuring information about Down Syndrome.And now she is seeking help from retailers and the public to ensure the caring project goes from strength to strength.Clare explains: “I started Special Delivery NI because when my third child, Aoe, was bornI was given her Down Syndrome diagnosis shortly after her birth.“I was shocked and didn’t know what le with a child who was ‘dferent’ would be like. “How would this affect my family  Would she be able to go to school with her older brother and sister  How would we cope with this ”Clare says she was given lots of leaflets on Down Syndrome which seemed to concentrate on all the ious the health concerns people with DS might face. She added: “It appeared to have her le mapped out. It was overwhelming and unfortunately mainly negative, slanted towards the worst case scenario. The midwives though very kind didn’t alleviate any of my fears - but how could they  “They had no frame of reference, just a memory of the last woman who had a baby with Down syndrome and left with the myriad of leaflets.”Clare remains determined that no mother and family who have a baby with Down syndrome will leavehospital feeling as she did.“I have to leave the boxes in the maternity units and the midwives ask the mothershe wants one. I want them to hear ‘congratulations your baby is perfect’ because they are. “All our worries and concern about Aoe’s future were unfounded. We have a typical family le. “Yes Aoe takes longer to achieve her developmental milestones but she does achieve them. She has taught us all about patience and determination.“The gt baskets contain positive information about Down syndrome. They include a ‘Wouldn’t Change A Thing’ book which seeks to portray the true stories of positive, lived experience typical of the majority of real people with Down syndrome and their families. “There is a letter from me congratulating the new mum and basically saying it is overwhelming but it will be fine - actually better than fine, amazing!

There has been talk today about drive-through vaccinations andI do think this is the sort of infrastructure that we#re going to have to be looking at to deliver this in order to ensure there is the maximum uptake.Not everyone is going to feel safe about going into a clinical setting at the moment, so perhaps that will be more acceptable to people.On encouraging more front line health workers to get the flu jab, he added: Obviously the worry for them will be the impact of a potential second wave of coronavirus.So we need to make sure more people aren#t being sick for regular reasons, enabling them to be fully al to fight any second wave.It#s also vital they don#t have a lower immune system when working in clinical settings.On the scale of the challenge, he said: It#s no small obstacle, in Northern Ireland we#re looking at trying to get close to two million people immunised.So we will need large-scale, almost medical camps set up in places to access the vaccine. In a way it will also be a practice run for when we hopefully do get a Covid- vaccine.Mr McGrath said the fast response earlier this year to setting up a Nightingale hospital in Belfast was an encouraging sign.He added: When we put our minds to it I#m very sure that we can achieve massive things.I#ve every faith we can do that but we would certainly want to see evidence that we#re progressing towards that quickly.This week, experts have also warned that complacency over the flu jab could risk overwhelming the NHS across the United Kingdom.Analysis showed a decline among vulnerable groups in England to getting the vaccine.Local authorities in England had an average of % of people with serious health conditions under  getting the jab, a % drop since . In Northern Ireland the respective figure for vulnerable groups under- was % - the target here is %.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this week: The vaccine is more vital than ever.Belfast Most ReadJohnny Adair convinced #MI agent# Dennis McFadden foiled his murder as New IRA hunt second spy in ranksSinn Fein members met #MI spy# in loyalist heartlandSecret#s out... pundit lets slip Rory and Erica McIlroy are expecting a baby girl #any day now#Ivan LittleOpinionTime for Sinn Fein to show Martina Anderson the doorBBC NI#s Tina Campbell: Precious family time in lockdown, her father’s friendship with Van Morrison and the ambition she still wants to fulfil,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Oisiacuten Campbell achieved a triple distinction in Level  Extended Sports Diploma at Northern Regional College’s Magherafelt campus, the equilvalent of three A*s at A-Level. Next month, he will be begin to study Sports Psychology at Liverpool John Moores University, with the long-term goal of helping special needs athletes prepare mentally and phsyically for sport. “The College teams up with local sporting organisations, giving us the option of volunteering with them,” said Oisiacuten, who plays Gaelic Football for St Martins GAC in Desertmartin. googletag.cmd.push “This gives me the opportunity to work with some fantastic groups, including Magherafelt Marvels Special Olympics Clubs and Peace Players which promotes ersity through sport. “The practical sessions could sometimes push you out of your comfort zone which was always a good learning experience.” Oisiacutens was awarded the Inspirational Student of the Year award at the end of his first year at the College and while lockdown put sport on hold, he continued to volunteer with Magherafelt Marvels. “Volunteering with the Special Olypmics has given me greater confidence in my own ability and reinforced the importance of giving clear instructions and listering to others,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “We kept in touch and posted home videos on Facebook so the athletes could continue their training at home during the lockdown.” Bronagh ONeill, Sports lecturer at Northern Regional College, said she was delighted with Oisiacutens success. “Oisin was a pleasure to have in the class and the accolade ‘Inspirational Student of the Year’ was so well deserved,” she said. “He was quite shy when he started the course, so it was great to watch him progress and grow in confidence. “He really benefited from volunteering with the Magherafelt Marvels but they have also benefited from his expertise and enthusiasm. I wish him every success at university and in his future career.“ Northern Regional College offers a range of full-time and part-time Sports courses.

Patricia recalled the moment his mum, Donna, was overcome with emotion watching her son hold an audience spellbound. “At that concert, when Dara sang the Irish song, I was sitting behind Donna,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “He hadnt sang it for his mammy purposely, and Donna just turned around and looked at me, and I looked at her, and there were tears in her eyes. I just nodded asto say, I told you so.” In a nod to the community ethos in Ballinascreen, Mrs Herron said the fact Dara is so grounded and kind is testament to his upbringing. “He is such a lovely young man, so mannerly and kind. Even when I watch him on The Voice, hes always worried about everybody ,” she said. Pupils and staff at his former primary school, St Eoghans, beside a poster in support of Dara McNicholl “His voice is an absolute gt, and a gt that he must share with the world, because anybody Ive spoken to just wishes him so much luck. “Behind that is a lovely young man, and we wish him all the best. Hes very grounded and so are his family.” Daras exploits in The Voice Kids competition have enthused pupils and staff alike at a school where they take performance and the wholistic view of the child seriously. “In St Eoghans, we place a lot of importance on performing, and getting to know childrens talents, discover what they are and develop them,” said Mrs Herron. “Some schools think nowadays that concerts and opportunities to perform take away from learning time, but that is when you learn things like resilience, self-confidence and self-esteem. “The children from this area seem to be very musical and its an important part of our school, but Dara is such an inspiration. “From Primary  right up to Pimary , and indeed the staff, they just want to be like Dara. Any chance to sing now in school, Ill have a line of about a hundred children waiting to audition for a solo part!” After securing his place in the final with a beautul rendition of Sineacutead OConnors Nothing Compares  U on Saturday, Dara will take on fellow contestants George Elliott, Victoria Alsina and Justine Afante in the final. Coach Paloma Faith described his voice at the weekend as one of pure beauty and his primary school music teacher agrees. “To see a young child come in in P, get to be such an amazing singer by the time he leaves school, and then to excel and develop, I just cant wait to see what the future holds for him,” she said. “I heard him in an interview, and one of the lines he used was, I just want people to listen to my voice. “Now people have heard it and theyre sitting up, waiting to hear what comes next.” You can watch Dara in the final of the The Voice Kids this Saturday, August , at .pm on ITV.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bark n Baths in the Springtown Industrial Estate has four dog washing stations equipped with a professional shower and dryer and specially formulated sham- poos and conditioners.  Co-owner Garaidh Tomas Grfiths said the idea came about after many dog owners had to start washing their own pets during lockdown. “All the dog groomers had to close but they were sharing videos online to show people how to wash and brush their dogs coat themselves, said Mr Grfiths. People had no choice but to do it for themselves, but they were bent over their bath and giving themselves a bad back. googletag.cmd.push Then they had to chase a wet dog around the house to try and dry them before they got that wet dog smell and after all that they had to spend another half an hour cleaning their bath so it could be used by the rest of the family again. Mr Grfiths, who also owns the Canine Lodge doggie day care, hit on the idea of opening a self service dog washing salon. “After lockdown people are looking to save as much money as possible and we are able to offer people the chance to wash their dog from as little as pound. googletag.cmd.push “Its great for people who have taken their dog to the beach or a country park and want to give them a quick wash and get rid of any sand or muck. Every station at Barks n Baths is set up with an industrial shower and dryer, highly absorbent towels, and PH balanced dog shampoo and conditioner and disposable aprons and gloves. A dogs PH level is dferent to a human so using the wrong product can affect their skin, coat and overall health, said Mr Grfiths If we can help someone maintain their dogs health we are happy to do it. A  minute session will cost pound and the price goes up from there to pound for  minutes, pound for  minutes and pound for an hour which would be long enough to wash and dry a big dog with long hair. There is also a private bay for dogs that may be anxious or anti-social. The private bay is partitioned off and has its own entrance so it is perfect for dogs that are nervous or aggressive around other dogs or people, added Mr Grfiths. We have had people come to us who have been told their dog isnt suitable to go to a groomer, so they are delighted this service is here.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the end of a dire game of football, substitute Ciaron Harkin latched onto a cross from Colm Horgan to volley City into the lead with just one minute left on the clock. A clearly dispirited Drogheda then conceded a second in added time as another substitute, this time Stephen Mallon, fired in a second goal to flatter Derry, who responded to their Europa League exit with a valuable win. In a game of few chances, Drogheda were on the front foot early on, showing a lot of energy and enterprise as they did not take Derry settle into the game at all. The home side could well have been celebrating an early goal. Darren Cole gave the ball away down the right and Drogheda countered, with Kane working his way in from the left, and he got a sight of goal only to blaze his effort high and wide without testing Peter Cherrie. googletag.cmd.push It took Derry  minutes to finally threaten the Drogheda goal, and it all came from another brilliant surging run forward from Eoin Toal, this time down the right-wing. Toal’s cross from the right won City the first of two successive corners, the latter of which saw Ada, Hammill cross brilliantly to Cameron McJannett who somehow headed over from under the crossbar when it seemed he must surely score on his debut. City were on the front foot immediately at the start of the second period and Ibrahim Meite, after a quiet first period, went for a spectacular effort almost immediately, his left-footed effort from the edge of the area curling wide of goal without testing Ross Treacy. googletag.cmd.push The visitors were asking the questions at the start of the second half but a Drogheda break, led by Mark Doyle, saw the home side very nearly take the lead. Doyle went on a mazy run through midfield right to the edge of the City penalty area, where his attempted shot was blocked. The ball however ran straight to Brandon Bermingham who tried a low first-time effort which had Cherrie scrambling across goal but it went just wide of the target. The game was heading to extra time before one decisive moment decided it – Colm Horgan breaking into the area and crossing for Harkin to fire in a fantastic finish at the near post with just  seconds left on the clock. There was still time for another goal to really flatter Derry as Meite’s threaded pass put Mallon through on goal and he smashed in his third goal of the season to send the Candystripes through to the quarterfinals.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep. He climbed well, as ever, encountering a dficult patch around the middle and then at about .km he spotted Baldaccini ahead of him, a past winner in  and .By now Hanna was in tenth place and with his climbing legs feeling good again set about moving up the field. He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki . Three weeks ago, David McNeilly, who now graces the ranks of the M category, ran a k PB of :and came home in : for a PB of  seconds dating back over seven years.Next clubman home was Niall Goodman in :, just three seconds outside the time he set at Eikon, he was slightly disappointed but the run consolidates the improvement he has made this year. The ever-improving Francis Tumelty is now in the M category and after just missing out on his K PB three weeks ago with a : clocking in Eikon, he smashed his : from the Bay Road k in  with a : PB here at Down Royal.Fteen year old Tom Crudgington doesnrsquot much like running on the flat mdash instead he loves the hills and mountains. However, hersquos learning that he needs to improve his running on the flat to take it into the mountains and here he set a PB by around a minute with his : time. Phil Murdock broke the -minute barrier for the first time clocking :.Mark Holland has shown steady improvement in training and is another who is getting faster as he gets older, now in the M category. With a previous best of around  and a half minutes, he smashed that with a brilliant : clocking, a fine product for all the work he has done.Nichola Watson has had injury troubles, but over the past couple of months has been training consistently again. Wondering beforehandshe would be strong enough to dip under  minutes, she put any doubt to rest with a brilliantly paced race to record a letime best of :.Also ing to racing, this time less than six months after giving birth to baby Roacutenaacuten, Ashlene Mussen surprised herself in recording a very strong :.Next up was the half-marathon and as ever a glutton for real punishment, Thomas OrsquoGorman toed the line on the back of his :: PB at Eikon three weeks ago. With conditions a bit harder here, he had to settle for :: and a th place.The final race of the day was the k where Lisburn ACrsquos Chris Madden won in an excellent :.Three weeks ago, Aidy Brown was gutted to run  seconds outside  minutes and  seconds outside his best and he vowed totoday and put the record straight. He ran brilliantly to record a big PB of . and dip under the -minute barrier for the first time.James King has been a revelation over the past year and after a wee hiatus during the first half of lockdown has put in a very consistent block of training. He was rewarded with a big PB on Saturday of . and also demonstrated he has learned the art of how to run a quick time ndash . for the first k and a swter . for the second half.At Eikon three weeks earlier, Frank Cunningham had run a PB of . and today came back and blew that out of the water to record . and a PB by  seconds.

At that stage, Bryansford had work to do with Clonduff leading - to -.Charlie Carr split the posts for Clonduff with a superbly taken score. Aidan Carr also got in on the act scoring a minor from play and Stephen McConville got his name on the scoresheet.Aidan Carr added another point and on  minutes the lead was extended further when Arthur McConville landed a big free to make it - to -.Bryansford needed something to steady the ship and they managed it on  minutes, getting their first score on the board when a free from Cathal Burns cut the gap to four points.Clonduff, however, were in no mood to get a case of the jitters and indeed stretched their lead to - to - when, in the th minute, firstly Tom Close got the better of his marker to break free to land another score, and then moments later, Barry OrsquoHagan did likewise.Bryansford were in need of some kind of encouragement and Danny Savage provided it on  minutes when he landed a free.Darren OrsquoHagan however went up the field and confidently steered between the posts to put Clonduff - to - ahead at the half-time interval.Early in the second period, Clonduff kept the foot on the gas to flatten the Bryansford spirit even more.Paddy Brannigan engineered just enough space for himself to punt the ball over Mark Reidrsquos crossbar.And then on  minutes it was - to - when Aidan Carr capitalised on space in the lsquoFord defence to leave Clonduff in the box seat.Clonduff were finding space more and more easy to come by and from a free after five minutes Stephen McConville made it - to -.Bryansford remained honest in the battle and made their third impression on the scoreboard when David McKenna pointed on  minutes.Clonduffrsquos machine was starting to purr productively and they rolled the scoreboard over once more ten minutes after the resumption when Stephen McConville knocked the ball over from play.The sides swapped scores on the -minute mark of the contest when David McKibbin made another minor from a free for lsquoFord, but Stephen McConville pointed for Clonduff to make it - to -.Fintan Canavan scored Bryansfordrsquos fth point before Stephen McConville responded in kind to again leave a nine-point cushion between them.The final minor before the next water break though went the way of Bryansford, Timmy Hanna notching it to make it - to -.In the th minute of the contest, Cathal Burns pointed Bryansfordrsquos seventh point. Savage kept pushing lsquoFord forward, using his experience to encourage those around him, and he knocked over their eighth score of the contest.Barely  seconds later it was Savage again scoring to give lsquoFord some real hope. That set up something of a tense finish to the contest when it had looked like it would be anything but.Twenty four minutes into the second half, Savage again was the commander-in-chief of the counter-offensive, making it three points in a row for Bryansford to cut the scoreline to - to -.A free gave Bryansford and Savage the chance to leave just a goal between the sides, and he made no mistakes, confidently floating his effort between the sticks, continuing his spell as a one-man danger to Clonduffrsquos superiority.However, as the clock began to become the enemy of lsquoFord, Clonduffrsquos Tom Close pointed from play to give Clonduff that crucial lead of four ahead again.Cathal Burns curled a neat point over the bar for Bryansford going into injury time to make it - to -.Then came a moment to stun Clonduff when Bryansford found a goal. Conor Maginn pumped the ball into the area and there was Timmy Hanna to palm it into the back of the net and force the game into extra time.The first ten-minute period of was a cagey affair, with both sides understandably more keen to avoid mistakes than push forward too much.Seven minutes into the first period, the first score was registered by Savage for Bryansford mdash it was the only score of that first spell.In the first minute of the second period Stephen McConville sent over a free, his seventh point of the afternoon.

Broadcast it live around the UK and beam it into the three regional capitals, in our case a venue like the Ulster Hall.

whilst there is a railway and buses ndash people come from further afield and do need parking.ldquoAt the moment we have visitors who overflow into the rest of the Island into the residential areas.ldquoAs well as being a cafeacute owner Irsquom a resident and I can see the problems.ldquoSomething needs to happen at some point to allow Barry Island to continue to grow.ldquoThe proposal for a multi-storey car park is a really good idea.ldquoWhatever is proposed and built is something that fits around Barry Island.ldquoWe donrsquot want an eyesore ndash the first thing that people see is some ugly monstrosity of a car park.ldquoIt would be really goodthere was some sort of multi-purpose construction.ldquoWhatever goes there needs to have some sort of validity as a building as well as a car park.ldquoWhatever is developed needs to provide good value, structured car parking prices.ldquoMost traders on Barry Island would say what wersquove got on Barry Island doesnrsquot really work.ldquoA pound for an hour and pound for the whole of the day and nothing in between.ldquoThis has been raised a number of times with the council, but it falls on deaf ears.ldquoThey are quite happy for visitors to be paying pound, but you canrsquot always walk from the car park for a coffee within an hour.ldquoThis is why car parking is a problem ndash because the charges are unfair.ldquoSomething needs to be done.Marco Zeraschi, of Marcorsquos Cafeacute, said: ldquoIrsquove always been an advocate of a multi-storey car park on Harbour Road.ldquoJust donrsquot put a brick building up or something sterile.ldquoDress it to make it look like a ship or a sail or something like that which would blend in with the seaside.ldquoDress it so it doesnrsquot look like an eyesore from outside the Island as well ndash it could be something special there, iconic.ldquoYou could do wonderful things with some good imagination.ldquoThe Nellrsquos Point car park is still up for development andwe lose that yoursquove lost over  car parking spaces.ldquoWe need an extra  never mind .ldquoIf you multi-storey the Harbour Road one there would be a vast improvement and you would have control over it to stop the boy racers at night.ldquoAnd it would make money for the Valethey had , spaces.He added: ldquoIf residents think theyrsquove got it bad now, the residents of the West End of Barry will have it as well.Vale town and Barry Town Council Baruc ward councillors, Nic Hodges and Steffan Wiliam reiterated their call for a multi-storey car park on the Old Harbour site.Cllr Hodges said: ldquoWith the increasing popularity of the island as a tourist destination, we must ensure it can cope with increased visitor numbers without detrimentally affecting residents.ldquoOur persistent call for resident parking on streets such as Redbrink Crescent, Plymouth, Clive and Friars Roads finally looks asitrsquos being heeded.ldquoThis will compel more visitors to use the council car park. But we have to go much furtherwe are serious about developing the economy of the island, whilst also ensuring a decent quality of le for residents.Both councillors, acknowledging the need to further promote more environmentally-friendly methods of getting to and from the Island such as public transport, walking, and cycling, said it must be recognised that families will continue to bring cars containing their beach equipment.ldquoIgnoring that fact isnrsquot an option, said Island resident and councillor, Steffan Wiliam, who first proposed the combination of resident parking and a multi-storey car park.Cllr Wiliam said: ldquoWe realised that we must future-proof the island so that it could sustain the welcome growth in visitor numbers, but also to prevent the unnecessary and unacceptable nuisance and anti-social behaviour that residents have had to put up with.ldquoThis is an opportunity to create something beautul but al with materials that complement the existing landscape, based on a maritime theme perhaps.

a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public -

Morgan of Penylan.The best bitch was a mongrel, ldquoTopsy, owned by Mrs Alexander of Raglan Close, Dinas Powys.ldquoTrixie, an eight-year-old Alsation took the prize in its class for the best dog handled by a child, Sally Woodward of Dinas Powys.The best sporting dog was ldquoTippy a Welsh Springer owned by Paul Wingren of Ludlow Street, Penarth.In the small breeds class, the winner was a Welsh Corgi owned by Miss Mary Jenkins of Plymouth Road, Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Peter Cardwell at Hillsborough Castle.“I hope the book is a fun, frank and honest account of what it’s like to work in Westminster.”It’s his first time as an author and already his book has set tongues wagging across social media.Special advisers are a part of the government, yet who they are and what they do is much misunderstood. Key advisers to Cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister since the s, their role is shrouded in mystery, despite acres of newsprint devoted to high-profile members of the cohort, such as Alastair Campbell and Dominic Cummings.Peter Cardwell’s book lts the lid on the people Piers Morgan called ‘these miserable little creatures’, revealing who spads are, how Cabinet ministers use and interact with them, how much influence they have and how they deal with the civil service. Featuring numerous anecdotes from dealing with counter-terror emergencies in COBRA to explaining what a dental dam is to the Justice Secretary, to having your inside leg measured in a Minister of the Crown’s office, this book has it all.BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said: “Peter allows you to peep behind the curtain of a much caricatured but little understood part of our political universe. With the structures of government in flux it’s a timely look at how some of the key relationships in Westminster work, and how they sometimes misfire.”Michael Crick, veteran political journalist and investigative authorsaid: “A book we have long needed.Peter Cardwell’s book fizzes with stories and humour from his experience as an adviser to four dferent ministers, and his years as a Westminster journalist with BBC Newsnight, ITV and Sky News.”https:www.portadowntimes news uk-news ni-man-peter-cardwell-loses-job-boris-johnson-reshuffle-A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_badbaafaadcd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ceabfffbeada   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_badbaafaadcd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ceabfffbeada   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
