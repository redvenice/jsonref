When nerve fibres in the skin, called C-tactile afferents, are stroked it triggers the release of ‘love hormone’ oxytocin, which makes us feel happy and secure. This could also explain why weighted blankets might have a calming effect, says Francis McGlone, a professor of neuroscience at Liverpool John Moores University.The concept of heavy bedding isn’t new parents have swaddled newborns for centuries, and weighted blankets or vests have been used for more than a decade to soothe children with autism.Around 70 per cent of those with autism sleep poorly because of differences in their melatonin production — the hormone that controls the sleep-wake cycle – as well as the way they respond to their environment.The theory is that a weighted blanket might reduce stress by changing how they process sensory information.However, while there is anec-dotal evidence that weighted blankets work, studies have failed to come up with scientific proof.         The mechanism behind them is deep pressure stimulation (DPS), a soft, even pressure applied to the body providing the feeling of a firm hug, swaddling or massage. Stock pictureAfter being contacted by parents who were using weighted blankets on their autistic children, Professor Paul Gringras, a children’s sleep expert at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital, decided to put them to the test.In his trial, 67 children with autism and a severe sleep disorder used either a weighted blanket or one of a normal weight that looked identical for two weeks, and then swapped to the other blanket.The study, published in the journal Pediatrics in 2014, found the blankets ‘did not help children with autism sleep longer, fall asleep faster or wake less often’.‘The negative results were important to know about, but disappointing for families of children with autism, as sleep is such a huge problem for them,’ Professor Gringras told Good Health.Alarmingly, two deaths have been linked to the misuse of weighted blankets: a nine-year-old autistic boy died after being rolled up in a heavy blanket and a seven-month-old, who had been covered with a weighted blanket designed for children over three.The blankets come in different weights, and Dr Sally Payne, a professional adviser for children, young people and families at the Royal College of Occupational Therapists, warns the weight should be appropriate (roughly 10 per cent of your body weight).‘To prevent the risk of suffocation, take the blanket off the child when they are asleep,’ she says.In healthy adults, a few studies have had more positive results.A U.S. study in Occupational Therapy in Mental Health journal in 2008, involving 32 adults with anxiety, found two-thirds were less anxious if they used a 30lb blanket.Meanwhile, a Swedish study, published in the Journal of Sleep Medicine and Disorders in 2015, found sleep quality improved when 31 insomniacs used weighted blankets.There is, of course, a drawback: they can make you feel very hot.And some sleep experts say the blankets, which cost up to £145, are an expensive gimmick.‘There is no evidence they provide any health benefit,’ says Dr Neil Stanley, a sleep expert and member of the British Sleep Society. ‘If you like to feel cocooned, make your bed the old-fashioned way, with a blanket and sheet.’Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist and sleep physician at Guy’s Hospital in London, agrees: ‘There is no real research on these blankets or how they work. But if you like the sensation and you find it relaxing and comforting, then that probably will help you sleep and it’s unlikely to do any harm.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Jonty donkey temporarily blinded freak accident given special SUNGLASSES","story":"Share this article Jonty was treated by expert staff at the animal hospital in Sidmouth, Devon, ran by The Donkey Sanctuary.Veterinary Surgeon Vicky Grove said: \u0027The stress of the injury and coming into hospital possibly triggered the recurrence of a chronic eye problem.\u0027Jonty suffered an immune-mediated inflammation of his whole eye.

Its director, Catherine Croft, said that even buildings with listed status protection were threatened, and that listing had become “just a minor inconvenience for determined developers”.“We must not allow quick profit or spurious ‘public benefit’ arguments to outweigh the loss of buildings which future generations should be allowed to cherish and enjoy,” she said. “Once demolished, these buildings, and the stories they tell, are lost for ever.”Half of the buildings are in the London area, including Richmond House, a building that once housed the headquarters of the department for health and social security.Designed by architects William Whitfield and Andrew Lockwood, the office block only opened in 1987. The plan now is to demolish most of the building to make way for a temporary House of Commons chamber and offices while the Palace of Westminster undergoes a refurbishment costing at least £3.5bn.The society highlighted the turrets that flank its entrance and the elaborate cathedral-like staircase with a working portcullis. It added: “The offices are beautifully lit and the extensive leadwork of the complex roofs is rigorously detailed.”Others in the top 10 with that listing are Ardudwy theatre, a striking brutalist building in Harlech, north-west Wales and the former All Saints Pastoral Centre and Chapel in London Colney, Hertfordshire, which was designed by Sir Ninian Comper, considered one of the great church architects, and completed by Comper’s son Sebastian in the 1960s.They join the grade II-listed former Birds Eye headquarters in Walton, Surrey, which was designed in the 1960s and is one of the first corporate HQs to be built outside London in the American manner. The building has been empty for 11 years and is due to be demolished to make way for 375 homes and commercial units.Other London buildings include the BFI Imax cinema in the centre of a roundabout near Waterloo. It had the widest cinema screen in the UK when it opened in 1999 and, with an underground line just 4.5m below the surface, was considered a sensational feat of engineering. It is now one of eight sites in the area identified as suitable for tall buildings in the Lambeth local plan.Also in London are the Nicholas Grimshaw-designed Homebase superstore in Brentford, now closed and earmarked for housing the British Library centre for conservation, which opened in 2007 and is now threatened by Crossrail and the Alton housing estate in Roehampton, on the edge of Richmond Park, which faces redevelopment.The society has been actively involved in fighting inidual cases, mostly unsuccessfully. That is the case in Sunderland, where plans to demolish the civic centre, considered too big and expensive to maintain, have put the 1960s building on the list.The top 10 is completed by the former Fawley power station in Hampshire, famous for its 650ft chimney.The society publishes its list every two years as a campaigning tool. Croft said more imagination was sometimes required. “Many of these buildings could easily be adapted for new uses. For instance, the Homebase store would make an excellent supermarket, and the Birds Eye headquarters could be converted for residential use.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f37c9decfa353f69dbc8bfb25f7e08159c4521ab/156_0_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88d4cba6d33f2cfe3410a37a315e575c","title":"do you live in a city planned from scratch share your experiences","story":"New cities are being built around the world at an unprecedented pace.

Many still live thereby Mathieu Richer and  Andrew MacDowallIn her flat overlooking the main square of Dimitrovgrad, 90-year-old Maria Oteva casts her mind back more than seven decades to the foundation of the town in the early years of Bulgaria’s communist era.“Back then, 50,000 volunteers built this city because they believed in something,” she says. “Nowadays, you wouldn’t find 50 people to come and clean up the dirty streets.”Oteva was one of those volunteers, aged 17 and eager to build a new socialist Bulgaria after the ravages of the second world war. She had joined the partisan resistance against the Nazi-allied government as a young teenager before joining the regular army in 1944 when Bulgaria, under Soviet occupation, switched sides. She operated a machine gun and then worked as a medic as the army fought its way into Hungary.Following the war, she joined the police force before being invited to join the “brigades” movement of volunteers being assembled by the new communist government for public works projects.The most ambitious of these was Dimitrovgrad, a city that was to exemplify the brave new world being created. Its spacious streets, parks and imposing public buildings, constructed in “Stalin baroque” style, still stand today.Scores of new cities are rising across the world from previously untouched desert and jungle, or on land “reclaimed” from the sea. While the history of cities built from scratch is long, the scale of the current epidemic is beyond anything seen before.\u0026nbspAnother 2.5 billion people are predicted to move to cities over the next 30 years and the trend shows no signs of stopping. New research has identified more than 100 examples, nearly all in Asia and Africa.\u0026nbspThis week  Cities meets the 90-year-olds who built the Bulgarian city of Dimitrovgrad after the second world war (many still live there) and visits the bizarre Bahria Town development promising Karachi residents protection from terror attacks and violent crime.\u0026nbsp We look at Hong Kong’s plan to build artificial islands for 1.1 million people and examine Egypt’s dream to conquer the Sahara. We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?Oteva was the leader of the first group of “brigadiers” to work on Dimitrovgrad, following a course of lessons in construction techniques. She lives in one of the original buildings constructed for workers in the city and spends much of the day on the balcony looking out over the town hall, watching life go by and children playing.“I believed strongly in the ideas and perspectives offered by socialism,” Oteva says. “It gave people power and the keys to their future.”Dimitrovgrad was constructed on the site of three small villages, and named after the first communist leader of Bulgaria, Georgi Dimitrov, who would die two years after the city was founded. According to the regime’s official version of events, Dimitrovgrad was established on 10 May 1947 when a group of 40 young people arrived at the site on the banks of the Maritsa River on the Thracian Plain and decided to build the city of the future. It was to be a symbol of the conversion of a predominantly rural society to an industrialised, urban one.The zeitgeist of that era is strikingly portrayed in murals at the Asen Zlatarov high school, the first built for the children of Dimitrovgrad’s workers. They depict the glory of workers striving to build a better country and future, with idealised communist images of family life, work, education and sport.“Dimitrovgrad was very significant, it was the first of the grand communist projects, and they constructed a totally new city according to communist ideals of urbanism,” says Dimana Trankova, a writer who has authored a three-volume book on communist Bulgaria and written extensively about the city. “The project was very important in showcasing the new Bulgarian government.”For some, the communist dream faded quickly. Penyo Penev, a poet, was an early and enthusiastic arrival in the city, and his works were promoted by the regime. But Penev killed himself aged 28, apparently disillusioned with the reality of life in the new utopia. His old apartment is one of the city’s few tourist attractions.As Trankova points out, not everyone participating in the brigades was an enthusiastic participant. While many were already won over by the relentless communist message, some felt compelled to join to improve their standing with the new regime, having come from families that had fallen foul of it.One of these was Peter Sharkov, now an 81-year-old author. Sharkov was born in a small village in south-west Bulgaria. When the communists came to power, his father’s land was seized by the government. Jobless and fearing imprisonment, the younger Sharkov travelled to Dimitrovgrad and enrolled as a brigade manager building housing units, despite his antipathy to communism.“That time was good for poorer workers, who had the certainty of a decent living but it was a hard time for the wealthier families, who saw their property and land confiscated,” he says, adding that he still feels resentment about the communist period. Nonetheless, he feels a certain pride towards Dimitrovgrad.“It’s important that the heritage is preserved,” he says. “All of this is made with our sweat. Everything has to be maintained – it was built by decent people who thought they believed in something. You can’t take that away from them.”After the fall of communism, a large statute of Dimitrov was removed from the city centre, and now lies face-down in a corner of a park. Sharkov, like many others in the city, would like to see it reinstated.Dimitrovgrad has made a rapid and incongruous transition to capitalist consumerism, says Trankova. Located at a crossroads near the Turkish border, the city developed a huge and lively market for previously unavailable goods, drawing shoppers and traders from around the region. Today, thousands come across the frontier to gamble in its gaudy casinos, which are illegal in Turkey.Dimitrovgrad is also regarded as the birthplace of chalga, a pop-folk style of music that embraces the sort of vulgar lyrics and conspicuous consumption that would have shocked the early pioneers. Finally, the city was re-dedicated: its name now officially refers to St Demetrios, a saint popular in the region, rather than the late communist leader.For many younger residents, times have moved. Ivo Ivanov, 25, and his 27-year-old wife, Viktoriya, typify a generation that has no direct memory of the communist era.The couple are worried about the country in which they are bringing up their three-year-old son, describing it as plagued by corruption and social injustice. A chemical factory originally named after Stalin employs about 1,000 people. This is a far cry from the days when it provided jobs for 10,000 workers and was the lifeblood of the local economy. The couple are preparing to move to the UK. Many of their friends are jobless.“We have a better life than our parents did under communism,” says Ivanov. “We want to get rid of the label of ‘communist town’ and start building a future with the help of the EU and young people across Europe.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac709e876415a095ab818ca8dabbd348446e6339/0_5_5120_3071/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0540d01efcacfe305ddc04be92558985","title":"farmer no deal brexit eu agriculture food britain","story":"Crashing out of the EU would not end uncertainty and would be a dark day for agriculture and food in BritainHere in the beautiful Cumbrian countryside, the sun is out, our grass is growing and the sky is blue. Sheep are busily nibbling the pasture while cattle are basking in the summer warmth. These are perfect conditions for farming. The animals are content and the farmers are working hard.Everything should be fine, but there is a big, dark cloud lurking on the horizon: the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. This is a threat to everything we do. The uncertainty around Brexit and the prospect of trade tariffs that would cripple our business is a real worry. The future direction of UK-produced food is simply unknown.Will we be forced to adhere to ever higher standards, while our government allows food to be imported from countries where farmers adhere to welfare or other standards that would, rightly, be illegal on my farm? Will our politicians assure British farmers that they will avoid a disastrous no-deal Brexit?Politicians visit farms and livestock auction markets and tell farmers: “Don’t worry chaps, it’ll all be fine.” Then we hear them on the radio proclaiming that the great prize of Brexit will be cheaper food.All this plays to my very real fear that we will be sold out as the British government desperately seeks trade deals with anyone who will have us. I believe they would happily open up our highly regulated food sector to all-comers if they’ll buy our financial services.Selling out British farming could end up being the legacy of Brexit. My fear is that free-trading ministers, who are frustrated by what they dismiss as the “red tape” of the EU, could sacrifice rural Britain in a heartbeat if it meant a trade deal with the US.We cannot let that happen. Instead of discussing just how many billions of pounds will be needed to mitigate the effects of a no-deal Brexit, politicians should be discussing their vision of what the future of British farming and food production looks like. We need to be thinking further than just 31 October.Our farm is a family affair, a mixed business that I run in partnership with my brother and my parents, on the edge of the Leven estuary at the head of Morecambe Bay.The parts of our farm are all complementary. We have sheep, free-range hens, beef and dairy cattle, all accredited by either the Lion code, Red Tractor or RSPCA Freedom Foods. We’re very proud to produce wonderful food to some of the highest standards in the world.Our family has farmed for more than 400 years and we hope to leave our land in good heart for the next generation. It’s why we’re involved in agri-environment schemes that promote bioersity, pollinators, good soil health and much, much more. We’re proud custodians of the countryside.When I look over my farm, I see opportunity. We need our politicians to recognise this too. They need to have a real, genuine conversation about how they will ensure the food and farming sector thrives far into the future, continuing to deliver for the public, providing them with food, shaping our iconic landscape and providing essential services for rural communities.We need to hear answers and genuine policies from both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson about how they will establish a sustainable domestic food production system that will stand the test of time. This is about UK food security. Right now, we have none of that. Instead I am having to shelve my plans to expand my business, and reinvestment is put on hold. That’s all down to the current uncertainty.I despair when I hear those who are dead set on leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October, pronouncing that this will bring the end of uncertainty. The huge irony is that if we crash out with no deal, uncertainty will remain king, but this time it will probably last for years while the powers-that-be grapple with the task of striking a future trading relationship with the rest of Europe.I don’t have the luxury of waiting to see what any of that produces. A no-deal Brexit could wipe out my business. And where would that leave our farmers’ ability to produce our own food? Shoppers would be subject to US chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef produced to standards much inferior to those I can guarantee.That’s not a future for British farming I want to see, and I don’t think the public wants to see that either. I believe British people love their countryside and want to see the rural regions thriving. I would love to see a future where British farming continues to produce some of the world’s best food, continues to care for the world’s most beautiful countryside, and provides a real model of sustainable farming for the future.I want farming to be recognised as part of the solution to climate change, as we work towards a carbon-neutral future. In the UK we’re not cutting down rainforests, we’re planting trees. We are champions of animal welfare, when some other countries don’t know the meaning of it.We don’t always get it right and there will always be room to improve, but I believe we have limitless potential, and for that to be realised we need some certainty back in our lives. We need real blue-sky thinking, not the black clouds of a no-deal Brexit.• Will Case is a farmer in Cumbria"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b7ebf35202261a74e13eb6551a452cfcac99c69/0_336_4185_2510/master/4185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d25935f5c8eefaf44c819dd4f389eddc","title":"lets be frank it takes more than talent alone to produce a fleabag","story":"Phoebe Waller-Bridge has defended her comedy against claims it is ‘for posh girls’, but working-class writers know that success is too often down to more than just skill and hard workPhoebe Waller-Bridge has responded to criticism that her TV comedy-drama Fleabag is “for posh girls”, arguing that judging work based on how privileged the author is “undermines the story”.“It’s not like my privilege created Fleabag,” she told the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day. “I created Fleabag, but from a point of place in my life where I was able to sit and write.”This being Britain, her comments have inevitably sparked a debate about class, with some social media users rightly pointing out that Waller-Bridge, who was educated at private schools and descends from titled nobility, would likely have had a different career trajectory if she had been born in a council flat and had to work two jobs to pay the rent.As the writer Chardine Taylor Stone succinctly put it: “Your privilege didn’t create Fleabag - but it helped Fleabag get made!”This isn’t about singling out Waller-Bridge for criticism. Not least because, too often, there appears to be a law that once a woman becomes “too successful”, she must be picked over and pulled down for the slightest behavioural infraction. Besides, Waller-Bridge herself partly conceded it was “absolutely probably true” that many other people don’t have the opportunities that she was afforded growing up. But the row does speak to something worth pausing on: not only the persistence of class inequality in certain industries in this country, but the very human reluctance to acknowledge the role of luck and circumstance in all our lives.It’s comforting to believe that our success is down to our own talent and hard work, rather than a complex mix of education, wealth and family. As Waller-Bridge said: “I like to think that whatever life I’d lived, wherever I’d been born or brought up, I would still have written it if I had been given the encouragement.”But anyone from a working-class background who has tried to break into a closed industry knows the picture can be very different for us, from having no social networks to the way a lack of financial security makes it harder to take risks. Even the capacity to imagine writing for a living when you grow up can be a privilege if you see no one around you in these jobs.Accepting this reality doesn’t diminish the incredible work of Waller-Bridge, or anyone from an upper-middle-class background. But it does enable a conversation to open up about just why this section of society is still disproportionately represented in the arts, and what can be done to elevate other voices.When Anna Burns thanked her local food bank, charities and the benefits system in accepting the 2018 Man Booker prize for her novel Milkman, it was refreshing because of its honesty about what it takes for someone who is poor to survive in creative industries. Burns didn’t pretend that talent alone got her to that stage she acknowledged the far-from-glamorous practical support that was needed to go alongside it. This type of frankness is all the more important at a time when an MPs inquiry recently warned that support for low-income writers is under threat due to changes to benefits.The richest of cultures is produced when it is made up of socially erse talent, which means that talking openly about what is needed to make that happen is in all our interests. As Waller-Bridge suggests, with the right life chances in place, many more working-class writers will be able to find their own “Fleabag” in them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a06b0a196668fba1fd0b32b065f4583611c883/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb5f29fd82273c3ece072e08a1ba66c","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of summer","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘summer’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘summer’.Share your photos of what summer means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 10 July at 10am.

Fortunately, an army of volunteers – and a couple of international cricket stars – came to the rescueRelocation can be daunting enough when it’s by choice and you’re just one family leaving and needing to find a new home for an entire cricket club takes it to another level. That was the task facing Uttoxeter Cricket Club when they found out that their lease was not going to be renewed.The search for a new ground was neither swift nor easy but the solution did come from somewhere close by. Just four miles down the road the village of Marchington offered a glimmer of hope. “The village club had disbanded in the early 2000s,” says James Burton, head of fundraising at Uttoxeter, who led the committee overseeing the move. “There had been a little bit of cricket in the intervening period, but there hadn’t been a permanent club for about 15 years.”The ground was in a state of disrepair, and investment was clearly needed to give the ground “a radical facelift”, says Burton – so when Staffordshire Cricket Board and NatWest CricketForce, among others, stepped in to help, the sense of relief was huge. “Staffs cricket and the ECB putting faith in us – that was massive. It felt like some value was seen in our vision,” he says.CricketForce, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) initiative with long-time cricket supporter NatWest, helps community clubs upgrade their facilities, making it easier for communities to enjoy a huge summer of cricket.“The building work started in around October last year, so it was a real race against time to get ready for the new season,” says Burton. The club’s first game was scheduled for 20 April 2019.Ensuring that deadline was met – and adding a bit of excitement to the proceedings – were England cricketers Chris Woakes and Danielle Wyatt, who joined an army of volunteers mucking in with CricketForce.“CricketForce has been massive for us,” says Burton. “The number of people there from the village was phenomenal. People who we’d never even met came and supported us and gave their time generously.“Chris and Danielle were brilliant. Everything we asked of them, endless photographs, autographs, you name it. They were getting stuck in.“It was lucky some of our juniors weren’t at school that day. It was a great chance to meet their heroes.”With the work completed, Uttoxeter were ready for their first game. As too were the locals. Starved of cricket since the early 2000s, many returned to the ground, keen to hear the crack of leather on willow.“We’ve got a community,” says Burton. “We’ve got somewhere we know is home, and we’re starting to put structures in place and build on all the hard work that has gone before.And the club is seeing benefits beyond the increase in spectators. New players have joined both the adult and children’s teams, and the club has increased in size overall. “A number of adults have made their debut this season and we’ve got a number of juniors who have joined us too,” says Burton. “Previously they wouldn’t have found out about Uttoxeter Cricket Club.”“We go all the way up to under-13s now, whereas previously it was only under-eights,” adds Burton, who is also one of the junior coordinators at Uttoxeter.He is particularly proud of the fact that some of the under-13s have made their debut in the second team this season. “That, for us – the fact the youngsters are integrating in the club, mixing with senior players – has been the big payoff,” he says.As with any move, particularly in sport, a difficult adjustment period is almost inevitable, however – and Uttoxeter hasn’t been immune to this. “The first and second teams are both in the relegation zones at the moment, and our under-11s have played two and lost two. But the under-13s, at least, are top of the league.”However, with the success of the club’s off-the-field move undeniable, Burton is glad the attention can finally be on the sport: “It’s almost like cricket can start being the focus now. We’re here and this is now the beginning. The new challenge is starting.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game, to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Her father, later a taxi driver, worked in local factories, and her mother was a bookkeeper at Smithfield meat market. Though she doesn’t have the accent, she is a cockney, born within the sound of Bow Bells.But her working-class background was something she kept quiet about among academic colleagues. Then one day, she recalls, a distressed student came to see her “torn between what she wanted to be and her community, friends and family”. When Van Bueren told her, “I understand what you’re going through”, the student leapt up and shouted: “How dare you? You couldn’t possibly know.” The student was astonished when Van Bueren said she, too, was working class. “Later, I got shy knocks on the door from other working-class students wanting to talk,” she says.Now Van Bueren has started the Association of Working Class Academics, which has recently met the vice-chancellors’ body, Universities UK, to discuss how the class backgrounds of British academics could be widened. That, she argues, is essential for students from poor homes to have role models to make them feel they belong at university and help with awkward social adjustments.I met Van Bueren, a QC, in London’s Doughty Street Chambers, of which she is a member alongside other celebrated liberal barristers such as Amal Clooney and Helena Kennedy. She has the kind of dedication to human rights that sends certain Tory backbenchers apoplectic: she helped to draft the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child she claims Britain is legally bound to pay reparations for the slave trade she argues that Britain, as a signatory of the UN Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, has violated international law by introducing high university fees. The Human Rights Act, she says, doesn’t go nearly far enough: it should also incorporate rights to food, water, adequate housing, and high health standards.Her views on what the law should do are diametrically opposite to those of this year’s Reith lecturer, the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption, who argued that lawyers are usurping the role of politicians.“In academia, people don’t feel able to talk about their backgrounds freely because they think it will negatively affect their career,” she says. Most of the prejudice is unconscious – such as academics talking about “bog-standard comprehensives” and the need to invite “clubbable” people to university gatherings. Those who complain are accused of having a chip on their shoulder.More important, perhaps, is young working-class academics’ lack of economic, social and cultural capital. They don’t have a financial cushion to help them through postgraduate study, the hours of unpaid research needed to get published in a scholarly journal, and the short-term, poorly paid contracts now common at the start of an academic career.“Universities are increasingly putting time limits on completing PhDs,” Van Bueren says, “which makes it harder for those who have to work while studying.”Young academics may also be handicapped by not knowing how to write a CV or who to use as a referee. Even the academic style of discourse may be difficult to master. “Academia is very theoretical,” Van Bueren says. “People like me come from backgrounds where people resolved problems with their hands.”Van Bueren is not alone in raising such issues. One academic wrote that, as a university lecturer, he found it harder to come out about his working-class origins than to come out as gay. Others have reported difficulties in doing the social and professional networking – at international conferences, for example – that is often necessary to become fully established in an academic career.Van Bueren has observed in the past that, while gender ersity in university faculties has increased, class ersity has, if anything, declined. Feminism and ersity are celebrated, but there is no equivalent celebration of working-class intellectuals. Van Bueren decided her to become a human rights lawyer at age 11, after reading the inside cover of Babi Yar, a novel based on the massacre of 33,000 Jews in Ukraine in 1941. “I thought I wouldn’t want this to happen to anyone else,” she says. Her own Jewish family suffered relentless persecution: her maternal grandparents walked from the Lithuanian-Polish border to the English Channel in the early 20th century, while all but one of her Dutch father’s family were murdered in Auschwitz.So how difficult was it to achieve her ambition? She played truant from school, immersing herself in the local library, because teachers told her that, with her background, she wouldn’t be able to read law. “I thought that if they didn’t believe in me, I would be better off teaching myself,” she says.Her parents told her that if she had piano lessons, money might not be available to support her through post-compulsory education. Her father opposed her plans to do a PhD at Trinity College, Cambridge, following her master’s at University College London, and said she should study to become a barrister because that entailed clearer income prospects. She agreed to do so because he was dying of cancer.She was not brought up in grinding poverty, however. The family earned enough to make a small means-tested contribution to her student maintenance grant and she hardly lacked cultural capital. “There were books in the home,” she says. “My father, though he left school at 14, was well read and bought the Observer.”When she went to Cardiff University for her first degree, “I loved it, literally from the first day … It was the 1960s. There was a feeling of openness, that anything was possible.”Shouldn’t we worry more about the paucity of academics who come from families in what is sometimes called the “precariat” or the “underclass” – people on zero-hours contracts, for example, who frequently endure spells on zero income, or families that depend on benefits?Van Bueren says she doesn’t use terms such as “underclass”, preferring “terminology that encapsulates people’s dignity”. “Working class” apparently does that, though some social scientists would say the term is obsolete.A former lead commissioner on the Equality and Human Rights Commission, she wants to bring class discrimination, alongside discrimination on grounds of race and gender, into equalities legislation.Don’t we need a more precise definition of working class? “We need to define class, not just working class, in the way other forms of statutory discrimination are defined – through case law. Everybody thinks they know who a child is. But one of the hardest parts of drafting the convention on children’s rights was defining a child. Do you become a man or woman at 12 or 13, as in some communities?“I want people to feel able to talk freely about their background and not suffer prejudice because of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/130e11a424b1a4caecc3c98f290b744aa9ae88bd/0_189_4320_2591/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5b4530976bd7b808ffc10ed1b357fa4","title":"primary school teachers want to see sats scrapped","story":"More than 54,000 primary members of the National Education Union (NEU) took part in an indicative ballot last month. The vast majority said they supported their leaders’ campaign for “a sensible alternative” to the national standard attainment tests, which they say are damaging children and narrowing the curriculum.The NEU said the result sent a clear message to the government that the assessment system must change. The results of a second question on the ballot paper, asking whether members would be prepared to take industrial action and boycott Sats, have not yet been released.The teachers’ poll coincides with the publication on Tuesday of the key stage 2 Sats results for 600,000 10- and 11-year-olds in England who took tests in reading, maths and spelling, punctuation and grammar (Spag) in May.The tests are used by the government to assess school performance and hold schools to account. The NEU argues that young children should not be tested as it leads to hothousing, stress for both pupils and teachers, and a narrowing of the curriculum.Kevin Courtney, the NEU’s joint general secretary, said the union’s indicative ballot showed there was “resounding support” for a change to primary assessment. “Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party all have major concerns about our Sats-dominated system and have pledged to change it.“Government now needs to listen, and to accept the need to change a culture in which too many classrooms are dominated by teaching to the test, at the expense of the learning and wellbeing of our children.”The schools minister, Nick Gibb, dismissed the ballot, saying that scrapping Sats would be a backward step. “The NEU’s indicative ballot does not even represent half their members, let alone the whole teaching profession.“These tests have been part of school life since the 90s and have been pivotal in raising standards in our primary schools. Abolishing these tests would be a terrible, retrograde step. It would enormously damage our education system and undo decades of improvement in children’s reading and maths.”Jeremy Corbyn received a standing ovation when he announced to teachers gathered at the NEU’s annual conference in April that his party would scrap Sats. Delegates at the conference voted in favour of a ballot over a possible boycott of Sats tests, seeing off an amendment from the executive arguing that a ballot was not the most appropriate tactic.Responding to the NEU ballot, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “These results should send the government a clear message that Sats aren’t working for teachers or pupils, and it’s about time they listened.”More Than a Score, a campaigning group of parents, teachers and education experts, said: “It’s not right or accurate to base a school’s overall performance on the test results of primary-age children. There are more supportive ways to assess children and fairer ways to measure schools, without the need to turn pupils into data points.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b98ffc8bdbb9f86e2b36b6509893b5005139d7e/0_570_8554_5133/master/8554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f94166c9a9c2104b681a9392fae2aa58","title":"teacher play teaching edinburgh fringe","story":"‘I feel healed by it’ - the teacher who has written a play about teaching and is taking it to the Edinburgh FringeOn stage, alone, a man is talking. He’s talking about Mrs Rayner, the teacher who opened up the world to him, who made him decide at the age of seven to visit China one day and see the dragons he was learning about. He’s talking about the joy of becoming a teacher himself, of the idealism he felt, of the children he reached and the transformative power of education.And he’s talking about the bullying, the pressure, the stress, the disillusionment. He’s talking of conversations with the child trying to learn on an empty stomach, the student who threatened him with a knife, the headteacher who wanted more than he could give, the pupils – and colleagues – who derided him for being gay. He’s talking of how painful memories of his childhood resurface when abused children seek his help, how his private life is shattered by his work, and how – over and over – he is driven to ask: should I stay in teaching, or should I go?Put your hands up, the audience is told each time: you decide.“We meet this teacher – it’s my experiences, but it could be any teacher – at breaking point,” says Matthew Roberts, the secondary teacher who wrote this moving one-man play on his phone during his daily commute. He will perform it in London later this month and at the Edinburgh Fringe.“The idea of asking the audience three times ‘do I stay in teaching or do I leave teaching’ means it becomes a discourse, punctuated with my personal experiences, which is alive.”It is not his first play: at the Fringe last year he performed Canoe, another one-man show he wrote about a gay couple wrongly blamed for their children’s accidental deaths. Critics described it as “a sad story, but a beautiful, heartfelt and, at times, uplifting piece of writing”, a description that could easily be applied to Teach, his new play.“I wanted to write from the heart, after the success of Canoe,” says Roberts, who teaches English at the Drapers’ academy in Romford, greater London. “Someone said: ‘you’ve been a teacher for 16 years, why don’t you write about teaching?’ My first reaction was: oh no, that’s too personal – because of the ripple effect of where that could go. But the ripple effect has been profound.”Writing the play was cathartic, he says. “Obviously, as a piece of art it is there to entertain, to make people laugh, cry and think. But I feel healed by it. I feel I have survived. There’s a strength in that.”The play, he says, is about survival, and how hard – and important – it is for teachers to cling on to their integrity when the goalposts keep moving.“I’m thinking about the state of education and the changes in the curriculum that have happened and are going to happen. And I’m looking at how to keep true to yourself as an educator and those beliefs of wanting the best for every child.”He started out teaching drama but retrained as an English teacher two years ago, after cuts to arts education undermined his ability to teach the subject he loved: “I couldn’t condone the changes they had made.” Politicians, he rages in the play, are starving teachers intellectually.The play also touches on the teacher’s emotional vulnerability in the classroom. “When you’re in a space where a safeguarding disclosure is made and you don’t know about some of your stuff from your own past, that can be extraordinary.”Painful memories of his child-hood have been reawakened by the children he has taught. “Every person is a door and they open things in your heart and mind.”As a teacher, he knows he must be able to hear something awful that’s happening to a student and hold back his own feelings. “As a human being, you break down later … and then go and teach your next class.”Throughout the 50-minute play he quotes depressing statistics from How to Survive in Teaching, a book by Dr Emma Kell about the state of teaching and the education system in the UK. “I wanted to make the personal political.” He hopes less experienced teachers who watch the play will get “immunity for what’s going to come in your career”.Roberts says he felt “broken” by the constant pressure after his first five or six years as a teacher. “It is a nightmare. There’s that saying from Confucius: ‘choose a job you love and you’ll never have to work a day in your life’. But what if the job you love is causing you harm?

Those that they do catch are dirty. If you open up their gills, you can see that the inside is black.”Against the cafe’s chatter, Lobna Ben Ali Bouazza nods in agreement. “When I was a child, my parents would let us play on the beach here all day, swimming in the sea – everything. These used to be the best beaches around. Now I take my children elsewhere.”Outside the cafe, the residents of La Goulette, a small fishing suburb to the north of Tunis, go about their business. It’s the first few days of June and the beaches are relatively empty. A few couples drift across the sand, while upturned fishing boats lie idly in the noonday sun. These beaches will be unrecognisable in the summer, as families from throughout greater Tunis, looking to escape the soaring temperatures, take the shuttle train across the capital’s lake, past the industrial ports of Rades, and on to the beaches, where their scattershot encampments jockey for space over the crowded sands.Tunisia’s pollution issues aren’t new. Its heavy industries have been impacting water quality for years. However, since the revolution of 2011, conversation over the environmental impact of its industrial legacy has at least become possible, even if the kind of reversals activists are calling for remain some way off.Officially around a quarter of Tunisia’s waste water is recycled, intended, among other things, to irrigate the country’s farmlands. The rest (around 247m cubic metres a year), is expelled from the country’s treatment plants directly into the sea and inland waterways. According to environmental regulations, industrial waste water should initially be treated at source, before being transferred for further treatment. However, campaigners question how rigorously this is being enforced.There are three hulking water treatment plants servicing the population around the Gulf of Tunis, at Raoued, to the north-west of the Gulf, Rades, near La Goulette on the western side and Souliman, at the gulf’s industrialised southern reaches.All are operated by Onas (L’Office National de l’Assainissement), a subision of the ministry of the environment and sustainable development and, according to activists, heavily subsidised by loans from international bodies.“It’s crazy,” Morched Garbouj, president of the environmental pressure group SOS BIAA, tells the . “We tested the water going into these treatment plants and we tested it going out and, I can tell you, there’s very little difference.”Across Tunisia, industrial and domestic waste water is channelled from broad areas to large treatment plants. Within the Gulf, the outcomes are clear. “We tested both input and output flows between 2016 and 2017 and the results were consistent,” Garbouj, an environmental engineer, says. “We found increased levels of nitrates, manganese particles, phosphate plus faecal coliforms and streptococci – both present within human waste – among other matters. All of these are harmful to health.“The government has disputed these findings, but they haven’t shared their methodology with us, so it’s hard to say how credible those denials are.“Waste water treatment in Tunisia is entirely centralised. Everything goes through Onas, including the development loans from, say, the World Bank, the EU and the German Development Bank. We’ve taken our findings to them. They’re aware of what’s happening. They know it’s not working. They’re just not interested.“It seems no one really cares how well the treatment plants are performing. Onas, which runs the plants, is a subision of the ministry of the environment and, you know who’s responsible for testing their effectiveness? The ministry of the environment,” Garbouj says.Wafa Hmadi, a programme coordinator with the environmental group RAJ Tunisie is equally damning, “It isn’t just the Gulf of Tunis,” she tells the . She says that around the industrial town of Sfax, and Gabes – near the phosphate mining basin of Gafsa – whole stretches of coastline were “unusable”. “Many of Tunisia’s inland waterways are also affected by heavy industry, such as paper manufacturing. Pollutants from industry find their way out into the local environment, impacting local populations, before heading out to the sea. Fish, particularly larger fish, are dying. Some areas are just totally dead.“There really is hardly any monitoring. Industrial polluters can expel their waste largely untreated, as there are no inspections and no one is holding them accountable,” she says.Little of this is news for Lobna and Samir. They and their families have been living with the outcome of rising water pollution for years. However, in a country struggling with ingrained unemployment and desperate to fight back against an ever increasing cost of living, both are equally aware of the desperate need for industry and jobs.However, for a city built by the sea, change comes slowly. Outside the cafe, along the sun-drenched shoreline, children swim in the the cloudy waters, or e off the walls of La Goulette’s ancient canals as they have done for years.“People come here. They always will,” says Lobna.The Tunisian ministry of the environment has not responded to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e9bb42b398ed4958d75b9683c4b08221efe6a2/0_41_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac3af98e91c1a8b9bb7168d8b16029cb","title":"the big scoop what a day with an ice cream man taught me about modern britain","story":"Tony Roach has been selling ice-cream in Eastbourne for 40 years – as his father did before him. But can he survive the extraordinary decline of the ice-cream van?You are only allowed to play the ice-cream jingle for a maximum of 12 seconds, when the van is approaching its destination. But Tony Roach flicks off the Popeye tune after only a moment’s airtime. “That wasn’t 12 seconds!” I wail. Roach blinks and looks at me oddly, then promises to play it for longer next time. There’s something about ice-cream vans that brings out the child in all of us.I’m riding shotgun in a pink-and-cream 2009 Whitby Morrison Millennium, accompanying Roach on the same round of Eastbourne, his hometown, that he has been doing for 40 years. The weather is warm, the sky is cloudless. Humming the Popeye tune under my breath, I help myself to another flake from the box above the fridge. It’s going to be a good day.Known to all as Ice-Cream Tony, 57-year-old Roach learned to scoop practically before he could walk. His father, Paul, was in the trade. “All I can remember is ice-cream vans,” says Roach. “From the age of six, I was going with my dad in the ice-cream van and helping. It’s all I wanted to do.” Paul taught him how to repair the refrigeration units and the engine. Most mechanics won’t touch ice-cream vans because they are complex vehicles, so, like an astronaut going into space, you have to be prepared to fix everything yourself. After his father died, Roach restored his 1972 Bedford CF Morrison van. It was an emotional task. “He was a great geezer. An ice-cream man through and through.”We pull up at our first stop, Roselands infant school, where parents are loitering outside. Roach switches off the engine and we sit there with the hum of the Carpigiani soft-serve machine for company. I feel like a lion watching my prey. The bell rings. Children flood out.Watching Roach spring into action is marvellous. If, as Malcolm Gladwell claimed, it takes 10,000 hours to achieve mastery in any given field, then Roach – who works seven days a week from the February half-term until October, 6am to 11pm – is a master 10 times over. He is the grandmaster of soft-serve Don Whippy King Cone.But fewer people are buying ice-cream than I thought. It’s murder at the infant school, and the primary school further down the road, and the third stop, a local park. In two hours, we sell maybe 20 ice-creams in total. At the park, Roach is anxious to tell me that, the day before, the queue was 20 minutes long.It’s not that the product is bad – it’s delicious. Roach uses a fresh milk mix from Mediterranean Ices, and is snobbish about providers who make their ice-cream from UHT. “I can always taste a UHT mix. You notice it when they’re walking away from the ice-cream van. You see how it runs down the edges? It’s melting. That doesn’t happen with fresh mix.” I look down at the cone I’ve been holding absent-mindedly, and he’s right – no drip.But people don’t have as much money to spend as before. Outside Stafford school, a child whines that his cone isn’t big enough. “That’s all the money we have,” says his mother, exasperated. “I’m not having anything for myself!” Later, at the Kingsmere estate, 40-year-old Christina Ward looks at the menu and says: “It’s well expensive, isn’t it?” Roach’s kindly mien slips for a moment behind his wraparound shades. “It’s only £2,” he retorts. Ward relents and buys three cones.Although Roach’s products are keenly priced – £2 for a small cone with flake, up to £3 for a large – if you have a few kids, that’s not much change from a tenner. Almost everyone buys small cones now, whereas before they would buy big ones, says Roach. “Since Brexit, people have less money, and less confidence in spending money. They haven’t got the money in their pockets they had a few years ago.” (Eastbourne voted to leave the EU.) As sales falter, Roach has ersified away from street trading, towards events, which are more lucrative.Turning ice-cream vans into a novelty for corporate dos and wedding receptions is a social loss after so many years spent chugging around suburban streets, Roach is part of the fabric of his community. He knows Eastbourne’s circadian rhythms: what time the schools get out, when families eat their tea and where children play outside (if they play outside at all – the period after teatime used to be his busiest, but now kids stay in).Often, as punters approach the van, he tells me their orders. “He’s going to ask for three medium cones with a flake,” Roach says of one older gentleman in a check shirt. (He does.) We serve 17-year-old Brendan Brooks, whose mother bought from Roach as a young girl. In Langley, retired train driver John Carney, 66, has been a customer for 20 years. “He brings the kids out, and they can see each other, because nowadays we don’t let children outside, they’re inside being cocooned ... And the mums and dads come out, so it’s a chance for us to have a chat, too.”From his vantage point on Eastbourne’s quiet cul-de-sacs, Roach sees social change up close – such as how people don’t carry cash any more. “Two or three years ago, if someone said I’d be taking cards, I wouldn’t believe it! But now you have to.” He’s an expert on Britain’s changing palates. Recently, people have started asking for vegan ice-cream. Roach doesn’t have any, but he does have dog ice-cream – not because dogs are more deserving than vegans, but because he did a dog show last week. Roach has observed more worrying trends, too, such as the climate emergency. “We’re having different weather than we had 20 years ago,” he says darkly. “The weather’s changing ... we get very hot spells and then very wet spells.” The Goldilocks weather for selling ice-cream, incidentally, is 21C, says Roach: “That’s just nice. I don’t like it too hot ... people can get a bit grumpy when it’s too hot.”But as our summers buzz longer and hotter, there is one constant: we Brits absolutely love soft-serve ice-cream. “People’s tastes change. But they can’t resist a 99.” Mr Whippy is British culture. “Other countries just don’t get it. It’s a British thing. It’ll be raining on a bank holiday, but we’ll still have an ice-cream. It’s one of those things only British people understand.”Soft-serve ice-cream is actually an American import. Mister Softee came to the UK in the 50s, but it wasn’t long before we concocted a homegrown rival, Mr Whippy, which was founded in Birmingham in 1958. Mr Whippy is the ultimate leveller, beloved by celebrities – Roach has served Piers Morgan and Davina McCall – and ordinary folk alike. Tony Blair wrote in his 2010 biography, A Journey, about being forced by spin doctors to buy cones for himself and Gordon Brown during the 2005 election trail. (Blair is not a fan.)Mr Whippy is elemental nostalgia. “Bing-bong, bingety bongety bong,” wrote Simon Schama in a 2007 Vogue essay. “Mr Whippy is calling, and we, short-trousered, snake-belted, grimy-kneed, snot-nosed, want what he’s got. We want a 99, God, how we want it.” You only need to hear the opening bars of Greensleeves and you’re nine years old again, scrambling for change then bolting barefoot out of the door. “Every time you heard that song played, even when you were little, you knew he was there,” says 44-year-old restaurant worker Stephen Humphreys, handing his daughter Aaliyah a cone. He bought from Roach as a child. “Quick, get the money together, leg it there before he goes.”Being an ice-cream man has kept Roach young. He credits his sprightliness to eating ice-cream every day for 40 years. He rarely goes on holiday, but when he does, the first thing he does is have a local ice-cream. (“It’s always rubbish. Not as good as mine.”) In winter, Roach restores vintage vans – he has a fleet of 12. At the beachfront, we bump into his wife, Yvonne – they have been married for 25 years. She confirms that ice-cream is not just a livelihood for Roach – he picked her up for their first date in the van. A self-styled “ice-cream widow”, Yvonne says Roach was meant to retire at 50, but keeps putting it off. “It’s never going to happen, and I’ve accepted it.” Yvonne asks her husband for a cone. “I hope you’ve got some money on you!” he says.During a lull, Roach shows me the trick to making the perfect Mr Whippy: you rotate the cone in a circle, then pull it away from the machine to create the point. (I am lousy.) At the Kingsmere estate, we sell three ice-creams and a slush puppy to 51-year-old reiki master Russell Dobson. “When they hear the noise,” Dobson says, gesturing to his son, “you tell them: ‘There’s none left.’” “You can’t do that!” Roach exclaims. “That’s what everyone tells them,” Dobson says. “Did you not know that?” (Later, at a playground, a girl of about five or six runs up to the van and asks if we’ve sold out. When Roach shakes his head, she looks confused, then enraged.)The day draws on and Roach and I drive through quietening residential streets, past pebbledash houses and trampolines and garden gnomes. There are mums with prams, dads in tracksuits and flip-flops, children in school uniforms on scooters – so many scooters, more scooters than I’ve ever seen before. Women come out of houses in bathrobes with wet hair and buy ice-cream to take indoors.Tony Roach holds Eastbourne together with engine grease and dairy cream. Like his father before him, he is an ice-cream man through and through – but he may well be among the last. Roach is at the heart of a dying trade, and a rapidly melting community. It occurs to me that this may be the fictitious Arcadia that Brexiters want: communities where the ice-cream man knows your name and your order, and your mother’s order before yours, and her grandmother’s order before that, probably. They have been searching for it, but it’s already here. This summer, at least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b931b9bfe1ee1cef41611a5f847cac53cd8372d/0_55_4513_2708/master/4513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17548eb18418a7791fc1c82a2b39e214","title":"fifa var womens world cup uswnt hope solo","story":"The greatest US team I have seen held off opponents who are rapidly closing the gap. Meanwhile, the game’s governing body hit a lowI had to wipe away a few tears as the final whistle blew on Sunday. It was emotional watching friends and former teammates win this World Cup. I understand what it means and I know first-hand the time and effort that every team member put into the end result.I was especially happy for some of the younger players who earned this – as well as the unsung heroes who aren’t in the spotlight and don’t get a lot of attention: Crystal Dunn, Sam Mewis, Kelley O’Hara, Becky Sauerbrunn, and Rose Lavelle. They all played so well during the final and across the entire tournament. You don’t hear a lot about those players but they are the heart and soul of this team.The game changed when the US were awarded the penalty. I wanted to see them score from the run of play, not from a VAR call. But, as it turned out, at 1-0 the game opened up and the Netherlands had to take more risks. The VAR controversy wasn’t whether it was a penalty or not (it was). The bigger issue is Fifa’s lack of respect for the women’s game. We have the fans, we have the viewership, we play quality football, and now it’s time we had respect. That means not testing VAR for the first time ever in women’s football on the biggest stage.VAR first needed to be implemented into women’s leagues around the world so referees could get used to it before a major tournament. VAR had at least been tested in some men’s leagues before being used at Russia 2018. And that’s even before we talk about introducing a lot of new laws at the same event. Women were used as guinea pigs. VAR has been so frustrating throughout this tournament that the Premier League has now said it’s reconsidering how it will implement the system.Lavelle, Dunn and Tobin Heath are my players of the tournament. Rose was a great playmaker, Tobin had inidual brilliance, and nobody could beat Crystal. Being unable to separate those three is one reason why this is the best American side I have ever seen. That doesn’t take anything away from teams of the past. We’ve had great athletes and good physical players like Christie Rampone – probably the fastest defender we ever had on the women’s national team – and Abby Wambach, who had unrivalled goalscoring ability, especially in the air. Yet the technical ability of the current team – from passing to reading the game – is better than any previous US side.How did that happen? Relying on physical players won us tournaments in the past. We used to have only under-16, under-18, and under-21 youth teams but as football grew we have been able to develop the technical ability of players at younger ages. The popularity of soccer in America means it was bound to grow and with better coaching now available for girls, better players have emerged.Still, women’s soccer in America has to be aware of how to remain the best in the world. We have put so much focus on the national team that we have cut corners on the domestic professional league. We want to always win on the biggest stage but countries like Italy, Spain, England, and the Netherlands are fast becoming leaders in player development. It’s incredible how much money has been invested in the Women’s Super League in England and Spain’s Primera Division. You can see how far those countries have come. They will ultimately develop better players than we do in the US unless we reconsider how we approach the big picture. Previously, US teams were competing with our own history. From this point on, we’re competing with the future and with the fact that other nations are quickly catching up.The US is already losing out on bringing more players to the NWSL because many top players want to play in Europe. If the best players in the world don’t want to compete in our domestic professional league, it is going to affect development in America. That should be seen as an exciting challenge for soccer in the United States and put more fire under the American game. We need a stronger US professional league, more financial investment, and better player development. That’s not only an investment in our team’s future success, but it’s also good business. This tournament again proved the market value for women’s football in the US and around the world – unprecedented viewership, packed stadiums, record jersey sales and more.We can’t stand still and let down the young girls watching this team win the 2019 World Cup. We want them to have an equal opportunity to play the game at the highest level and build women’s football to levels we haven’t even come close to yet. We want today’s team to wipe away tears when they watch future generations add more stars to the shirt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fccb4839ba8142351bcdd366b84fe9f9b743a4e/0_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca4ca94576f1c569ec20ab57334ef8fd","title":"us womens soccer team equal pay us soccer world cup","story":"The US secured the World Cup trophy on Sunday. And they also won something just as valuable for their lawsuit against US Soccer: public goodwillJust after the US sealed their fourth Women’s World Cup on Sunday a chant broke out around Stade de Lyon: “Equal pay! Equal pay!”It may have taken the players a while to discern what the fans were shouting, but eventually they understood. The supporters in the stadium – or the vocal ones at least – had sided with the team in the gender discrimination lawsuit that has lingered in the background of the Women’s World Cup, and is now waiting for the players as they return to the US.“It was fantastic to be able to hear the support of the fans in the stadium for something we’ve been fighting so hard for, especially on a global stage,” said winger Tobin Heath. “I think it’s just the start of something massive and culture changing.”While “equal pay” has many facets – including the massive disparity in prize money that Fifa offers the winners of its men’s and women’s World Cups – there is no more pressing concern than the lawsuit the players filed against their boss, the US Soccer Federation. The players allege US Soccer has practiced “institutionalized gender discrimination” – and it’s not just down to pay. The players have often found themselves in inferior accommodation to the men and, unlike their male counterparts, the women’s team have had to compete on artificial turf, which leaves footballers more prone to injury.Coming into the tournament, the players insisted the lawsuit sat on the backburner and that trying to win the World Cup was a separate goal. But they know lifting the trophy has helped their case and put pressure on US Soccer.Asked how the World Cup win changes the lawsuit, Megan Rapinoe smiled. “Well, it’s not good for them, is it?” she asked rhetorically, referring to the federation.Indeed, at the core of the players’ argument is that they have had to win to get paid while the men have been compensated more generously without getting close to a World Cup title. The rallying cry has been “equal pay for equal work” but in fact the women have done more work. In a typical calendar year, they play more often than the men, to the point where the women bring in more money from games, the biggest single source of revenue for each team. That shoots a harpoon into the heart of the argument that the men should be paid more because they generate more money.But while the lawsuit doesn’t hinge on the US winning the World Cup, everything else will. The public support for the team, who are as popular now as they have ever been, will continue to surge. US Soccer is now in a fight with its most successful and beloved team, and will probably want to resolve this without going to trial.Both sides in the lawsuit have tentatively agreed to mediation, and winning the World Cup adds pressure on US Soccer to meet the players’ demands, which sources say include a payout for current and former players in the tens of millions of dollars. That sum should not be beyond the means of US Soccer, which is reportedly sitting on a surplus of $150m. Right now,a settlement seems like the most likely outcome since truly “equal pay” may not be possible. The US national teams negotiate separate collective bargaining agreements with different pay structures, and the women are not asking for the same compensation as the men. After all, the women get salaries combined with bonuses while the men just get bonuses. But the women argue that, in addition to substandard treatment in other ways, US Soccer offers the women less compensation overall, regardless of how it is doled out.Now though, the women are World Cup champions, and those upcoming mediation sessions will likely take a different tone than they would have if the US had crashed out before the final. After all, they won on the largest stage and, with the world’s attention on the champions, the public began chanting for equal pay. That wave of support will not be lost on the lawyers dealing with this lawsuit – and it was certainly not lost on the players.“It was freaking amazing,” goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris said of the chants. “When this is all said and done, we probably won’t remember very much from this match, but the legacy we leave behind of pushing women forward and standing up for what’s right, that is what’s important and what’s what we’re continuing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6c005ee20c1a851cec8df1012b7f12fe8f3691/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7e5e38aa7a871324e2a2f50891885b8","title":"womens world cup 2019 guardian writers highs lows","story":"From kindly taxi drivers to the great goals, games and Megan Rapinoe, our writers tell all about their month in FranceMatch of the tournament England 1-2 USA. Yes, England lost and, on balance, they deserved to be defeated but it was tense and tight and a wonderful advert for the women’s game. An evening when many of those who have long patronised the sport were surely won over, with even the most stubborn refuseniks having to admit that it is rather good after all.Player of the tournament Jill Scott. Admittedly she tired a little as England lost the third-place play-off to Sweden but the midfielder frequently held Phil Neville’s team together. It is no exaggeration to say that, without Scott, the Lionesses may not have reached the final four.Goal of the tournament Lucy Bronze v Norway. An imperious, unerring, first-time, 25-yard strike. The look on the watching David Beckham’s face after he had admired its inexorable trajectory towards the top corner spoke volumes.

It was comedic at times but also a truly dreadful, and depressing, advert for the women’s game. Fondest memory of France The consistent friendliness, politeness and helpfulness of virtually everyone I encountered. As someone who, bar the odd “Je suis désolé”, cannot speak French, that proved refreshingly stereotype-defying.Match of the tournament In terms of atmosphere it has to be France v USA at the Parc des Princes. La Marseillaise sung in full voice at the start was spine-tingling and it was fiery from start to finish. For the match itself? The final, purely because the Netherlands were really impressive at holding the champions at bay for as long as they did, having looked defensively shaky throughout.Player of the tournament It is obviously Megan Rapinoe. Plenty of players had great World Cup tournaments but no one matches the on- and off‑the‑field all-rounder. Using the biggest stage in the world to speak out on the issues she cares about while juggling the pressure to perform that that brings? Incredible. Megan for president.Goal of the tournament Lucy Bronze’s rocket against Norway. It was beautiful. Capping a great performance, the way Bronze waited alone on the edge of the box and powered it into the roof of the net was magical.Personal highlight Too many to choose. The England press pack have been a fantastic bunch to work with, for one. The final week in Lyon was by far the highlight. I got to go beyond the World Cup and take part in the Equal Playing Field World Record five-a-side match (dragging a motley crew from Phil Neville’s press conference to take part too) and then attending and moderating a session at EPF’s Equality Summit – a packed room of stellar influential women in football discussing the game, changes, challenges and more? Absolutely buzzing.Biggest disappointment France. They are experienced at hosting major tournaments but you could be forgiven for thinking this was their first time. There was little hype, at alleged sold-out matches – semi‑finals and final in particular – it was frustrating to see as many empty seats as there were. Staff were overzealous (they confiscated my water because it wasn’t the right sponsor in close to 40C heat) and transport to and from stadiums was a nightmare.Fondest memory of France Given the above … the fondest memories I will take from this tournament are of the people I was working with, the people I was socialising with, the brilliant Football Association communications team and the general playfulness of the England players.Match of the tournament For pure momentum shifting it is hard to look past the Netherlands-Japan last-16 game. The Dutch started the first 30 minutes close to their imperious best but as the second half wore on the Japanese grew exponentially into the contest. Only another late VAR‑bacle could decide the match, one worthy of being played much later in the tournament.Player of the tournament The big names and strikers often scoop the accolades at tournament’s end, but it is the midfield metronomes who best determine their side’s fortunes. When the USA are in trouble it’s the pure tenacity of Julie Ertz that sets the tone, while for the Dutch Sherida Spitse has added four assists to a near flawless display of passing, tempo-control and tackling.Goal of the tournament For team goal, Japan’s against the Dutch – calm, clinical, creative. For feeling, Jamaica’s first World Cup goal – Havana Solaun, only just off the bench, sent brilliantly through by Khadija Shaw and finishing with aplomb.Personal highlight Amid the wreckage of Australia’s Group C opening defeat rose the phoenix of one of the feelgood stories of the Women’s World Cup: Italy. After a 20-year absence Le Azzurre announced their arrival in the women’s game – passionate (Elena Linari’s anthem belting), ruthless (Barbara Bonansea’s cool tournament opener) and cultured (Aurora Galli’s finish against China).Biggest disappointment Germany. There were questions marks over this squad, and injury to the playmaker Dzsenifer Marozsan did not help. Riding their luck in game one as a pacy Chinese side comfortably got in behind should have been the canary in the coalmine, but then came that defensive showing against Sweden to blow the quarter-final.Fondest memory of France After Australia’s “nightmare in Nice” against Norway my tournament was in effect over. To watch in among the crowd, surrounded by 53,000+ others, a game of the intensity, quality and excitement of USA v England was to witness the pure potential of the women’s game. Match of the tournament England’s match against USA. The game had everything: great goals, VAR controversy, a missed penalty and a red card. But at its core the semi-final was a battle of two heavyweights playing some of the best football of the tournament.Player of the tournament Who else but Megan Rapinoe? My respect for her grew tenfold when she fronted the press in the leadup to USA’s blockbuster quarter-final with France. The Twitter spat with Donald Trump was threatening to overshadow the match but, rather than hide from the issue, Rapinoe pre-empted the first question: “I’ll just address it head on and then we can get to the soccer questions. I stand by the comments that I made about not wanting to go to the White House with the exception of the expletive. My mom will be very upset about that.” All class.Goal of the tournament It was perhaps not a goal for the ages but when Havana Solaun collected an incisive through-ball on the break before rounding the Australian goalkeeper Lydia Williams and slotting home, the joyous celebrations of the small contingent of Jamaica fans in Grenoble said everything. For this Caribbean island to reach the tournament against all odds and then score their first World Cup goal – moments such as that make these tournaments special.Personal highlight This is my third major tournament covering my native Australia, having followed the Socceroos at the Confederations Cup and World Cup. In that time, I had yet to see my homeland win. Then, in a comeback for the ages, the Matildas scored three goals in the space of 20 minutes to defeat Brazil. Truly, the miracle in Montpellier.Biggest disappointment While smaller host cities got into the World Cup spirit – Valenciennces deserves a shout-out for its abundant tournament signage – in the larger cities it was hardly obvious that a World Cup was being staged. Fondest memory of France I feel privileged to have had a ringside seat to a tournament that will, I suspect, be remembered as an inflection point for women’s football. The tournament has been far from perfect but over the past four weeks there has been a real sense among players, observers and fans of the significance of this tournament. In a world struggling to redress systemic gender inequality, the rise of women’s football is a force for good. That – and the 21 croissants I consumed – will be my fond memories from France.Match of the tournament Italy 0-1 Brazil in the group stage. From the matches I covered, I always seemed to be in the wrong place, watching the wrong 22 players as another match from the same day brought about 90 scintillating minutes of football as I was left with some dishwater. However, when Italy and Brazil clashed in Valenciennes, it was a rare treat to see both teams so enamoured and keen to attack.Player of the tournament Kosovare Asllani. The one-of-a-kind Swedish No 9 has been kicked up and down the pitches across France, running on fumes and driving ever forward for Blågult this tournament. Having matured an astounding amount between leaving and returning to the Swedish Damallsvenskan, this summer has seen Asllani remind the world just what’s she’s capable of. Goal of the tournament After attending 21 matches, everything has unfortunately rather blurred together but Lana Clelland’s belter against Japan sticks out. Just 12 minutes into her World Cup debut, the Scotland striker was left in space in front of the Japan box with time to pull back and put her laces through the ball. Personal highlight After I arrived at my hotel in Nice only to be told they’d given the room away, I popped up a frustrated tweet and immediately had 10 people message me offering to help. I was tired, sweaty and disgusting in every single way but in that moment I was overwhelmed by the kindness of the women’s football community.Biggest disappointment That almost at every match (before kick off or at half-time) the stadium announcers would encourage everyone in the stands to engage in a Mexican Wave. Wholly unnecessary.Fondest memory of France When I finally got to say goodbye to the Murder Basement when I left Paris to travel down to Lyon. It will not be missed.Match of the tournament The Brazil v Australia group stage game. With Australia desperately needing a result to keep their knockout stage aspirations alive coupled with the fermenting rivalry between the two sides, this game had everything: spikiness, a comeback victory and a dash of VAR controversy.Player of the tournament Megan Rapinoe. Partly because in games where the US haven’t looked as convincing as the standards they have set for themselves might demand, she’s been the player to pull them through. But also for how, with her candidness and her determination to use her platform and profile to consistently draw attention to the contexts and issues which affect the women’s game. So in that sense too she really has been the player of the tournament, a figure really transcending the sport.Goal of the tournament Lucy Bronze v Norway. What a way to cap off a personal performance par excellence in that quarter final.Personal highlight Seeing how this tournament has engaged people who ordinarily wouldn’t have bothered with football, and has helped to reframe how they see the game. I got chatting to a bloke who, after hearing I was in France for the World Cup, started to reply with “Speaking as a man…” (I inhaled and braced myself for a potentially awkward interaction) “…who has previously had no interest in football at all because of the theatrics and nonsense in the men’s game, I’ve really enjoyed the last few weeks and have been making the effort to watch the games” (I exhaled and relaxed into the conversation thereafter).Biggest disappointment The difficulty of watching games if you couldn’t be physically at the stadium, particularly for the early stages. Not having games on free-to-air TV, and the reticence of many bars in host cities to show games unless prompted, particularly in the group stages, made seeing some games unnecessarily difficult and gave off the feeling that the World Cup was being tolerated rather than embraced in the way that the men’s tournament would be.Fondest memory of France It’s difficult to go beyond the camaraderie and generosity of spirit of the fan groups and football communities coming together. For New Zealand’s opener against the Netherlands I found myself sitting in a very Netherlands-filled section of Stade Océane a lone Kiwi in an Oranje sea. No matter. “If you lose, you have some shoulders to cry on,” one told me before kick off, and we commiserated at the final whistle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbdb9aee274695fe8edb2015befbaa6fda3a6670/0_281_4911_2948/master/4911.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f367a975d9f976115e0c4c2984c7a07e","title":"womens world cup football eni aluko","story":"The future of the women’s game has never looked brighter but keeping fans interested after the World Cup is vital to its growthThe Women’s World Cup has been a tournament we will look back on as the point when all of our longstanding expectation of what women’s football could be was realised. You just have to look at television viewing figures around the world, which have been better than anything the men’s game has managed this year with nearly 12 million people tuning in to watch England’s semi-final defeat by USA and another 25 million in Brazil watching their last-16 game. That is immense.It’s completely shattered the myth that people are not interested in women’s football. I think we have to be honest and say not every stadium in France was sold out, so that was a disappointment, but that is very much part of the next step to continue the surge in interest. There is a risk women’s football becomes the most popular spectator sport that fans tune into every four years but are not interested in parting with their money to watch the same players on their doorstep.All football stakeholders and decision-makers must make sure that people who fell in love with women’s football stay in love with it and start turning up every week to watch the same players they have been watching over these past four weeks. We want the leagues to be strong and sustainable and to have their own economies because of the number of eyes that are now on the sport. Broadcasters must be ready to invest heavily but will not do so if stadiums are half empty every week.There has been a lot of discussion about whether the Premier League should step in to take over the Women’s Super League. If the Premier League can market the games alongside the men’s then I think that is one way of capitalising on the current interest. There has to be a league-wide strategy for all the clubs to work out how to entice fans to turn up every week through marketing, ticketing deals and club merchandising on site. Whether it’s discounted rates for men’s matches if you come and watch the women’s team or merchandising benefits exclusively available at women’s stadiums, there are lots of smart ways to start changing fan attendance habits.It’s great to see Manchester City have announced their derby against Manchester United is to be played at the Etihad next season. Chelsea have also announced their derby against Spurs will be played at Stamford Bridge. I expect both games will be sellout crowds just as we saw at my club Juventus last season against Fiorentina. It is vital that these games don’t just become one-off occasions either – games at men’s stadiums should be happening five or six times a season or build fit-for-purpose stadiums for the women’s teams that will sell out every week. Once we get the attendances right, the broadcasting money will come flooding in which we all know revolutionised the status of the men’s Premier League and its clubs.On the pitch, the level of play has been outstanding, particularly in the knockout stages of the competition. Every knockout round had a game that featured an exceptional level of play, from USA v France or Netherlands v Japan and that has been very encouraging.USA ended up being worthy winners and I think they are probably the best women’s football team of all time. What inspires me most about the USA team is the unapologetic way they lead the way on political issues such as equal pay and do so as badass women who are ruthless in their pursuit of success. I believe England can take a huge leaf out of USA’s book in terms of the winning mentality but also the way in which their players use their platforms for change. I still think in England players are labelled “troublemakers” for doing so. The USA women are far from troublemakers but icons and pioneers.It doesn’t seem to matter about which generation it is – there is something in the college system and through to the national team that makes these women absolute winners. There’s something in that mentality which I’m not sure you can coach. It’s just in their DNA. We have to figure out in Europe how to embed the same mentality into our football culture. We are, however, closer than ever before. Those fine margins that saw Ellen White’s goal disallowed in the semi-final would not have been the difference years ago.The key could be the growing strength of our domestic leagues, with the Champions League as the pinnacle. I think Uefa now has to introduce group stages for the Champions League so it gives more players exposure to top-level international competition. All of that helps to build experience that could translate to England going from the semi-finals to the final or Netherlands winning the World Cup next time round. The 2021 European Championship in England is surely a big target for Phil Neville and his team to win.It is not far on the horizon, but one thing is certain: the future for women’s football around the world is phenomenally bright."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffee3b16394e879c31003b8c7efa7e8ea9b382e4/1227_296_1404_842/master/1404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d6a152778c8529d4311573c67d5a8fc","title":"india social stock exchange could revolutionise ethical impact businesses aid nirmala sitharaman","story":"Proposal could provide cheaper funding for welfare projects, says finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, but critics warn against greater government control of aidIndia’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has called for the creation of a “social stock exchange”, allowing ethically minded investors to buy stakes in social enterprises, volunteer groups and welfare organisations.The proposal would be a radical experiment in a country characterised by stark inequality and rapid economic growth.If created, the exchange could provide new and cheaper sources of financing for social welfare projects, while showcasing India’s independence from foreign aid as it seeks to enhance its position on the world stage.“It is time to take our capital markets closer to the masses and meet various social welfare objectives related to inclusive growth and financial inclusion,” Sitharaman said in her maiden budget speech on Friday.Sitharaman’s plan for a social stock exchange marks a new focus on sustainability and social impact in business, said Amit Bhatia, CEO of the Global Steering Group for Impact Investment. “Before, the main objective of investors was to maximise return,” Bhatia said. “In the past few years, impact funds have multiplied and every major private equity firm is jumping in.”According to Bhatia, such “impact” assets have risen from $0 to $22tn (£17tn) in the past two decades, and almost all the major S\u0026ampP 500 companies are doing some sort of sustainability reporting.“It’s an unstoppable trend,” he said. “We have found a higher purpose for capital.”He said a social stock exchange, if launched, would mean the government would have to create a legal definition of “social enterprise”, and businesses would start measuring the social and environmental impact of their work.The exchange has another benefit – it could highlight India’s self sufficiency as it makes a bid for superpower status.In the past decade, successive governments in India, including Narendra Modi’s, have been hostile to foreign-funded NGOs. Critics see international NGOs as a neo-colonial enterprise and a conduit for Westerners to meddle in Indian affairs.“India has a very vibrant social entrepreneurship scene,” said Subhash Chandra Garg, India’s finance secretary. “We have almost eliminated foreign aid. We are independent. We are financing our own development.”Garg said that the launch of the exchange was still in its “exploratory stage”. If created, the exchange is likely to be regulated by India’s Securities and Exchange Board and allow charitable organisations to raise capital in the form of stocks or trading units.Critics of Modi suggested the exchange may be used to increase the funds available to political organisations.Modi’s Hindu nationalist government has strong links with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a network of right-wing volunteer organisations. The RSS is known in India for undertaking vast social projects such as building toilets in rural areas and cleanliness drives, but have also been criticised for being Islamophobic.Sharma said that like strongmen leaders around the world, Modi’s government was distrustful of academia and experts and looked to right-wing thinkers for policy ideas.“One of the things that was unique about his first term was that he has less trust for western-educated economists than those from within the RSS,” he said. “You could say the demonetisation experiment was very much something that emerged from that group of thinkers.“This budget was part of the broadening of the indigenisation of economic thinking. It’s looking for an Indian solution to Indian problems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9656e476789b1fb70bf5bd4c64f3c8e7b279c88a/0_256_5848_3508/master/5848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8428abc0726eaddc61d86c81d318d6ec","title":"nurse repays more than banker time scrap university tuition fees","story":"The English student loan system is unfair and the Augar review doesn’t even start solving the messAs August approaches, university administrators will begin to sweat. This is the worst summer in living memory for post-18 education in England, thanks to the falling pool of students. This year there are 115,000 fewer 17- to 18-year-olds than in 2012, when tuition fees rose to £9,000. The drop in Wales is even greater. So there will be fewer bums on seats this autumn. And since universities have expanded hugely to cash in on fees, the introduction of the market has created a bubble that is now bursting.There has been a growing sense of panic, and one response was the Augar review, commissioned by Theresa May. May ruled out a return to a fully taxpayer-funded system, so the review had to be narrow in aspiration and imagination. Then, of course, May bungled Brexit, and put off many overseas applicants to UK universities through her hostile environment and xenophobic rhetoric, making things worse.Constrained by circumstances, Philip Augar and his colleagues produced recommendations that would extend the duration of tuition loan repayments to 40 years and double the overall repayments of some of the lowest-earning graduates. The reception to the report in UK universities (outside of Scotland) was alarm.May resigned and Augar was shelved. Neither candidate for the Tory leadership has shown any interest in the topic, so now we are back to panic.Today the Progressive Economy Forum (PEF), a group of independent economists, publishes a new report, explaining why the Augar review fails and how even more of the evidence points strongly to abolishing tuition fees, which is Labour’s policy. A huge injustice remains in the system. Consider a nurse and banker, both graduating with a debt of £44,000. The nurse will never fully pay off the debt the banker will do so in 17 years, accruing £11,000 in interest. The banker’s total repayments will be £55,000 the nurse’s £59,000, £18,000 of it interest. Under Augar’s system, the lifetime repayments by some lower-earning female graduates would actually double. That’s not fair.For fees and loans to work, the highest-paid UK professionals would have to carry on being paid many times more than those in ordinary jobs – otherwise the entire loan book would collapse. The UK already has the highest income inequality in Europe. The current system locks in that gross inequality so if we want a more equal society, we will have to scrap it.The PEF report suggests a cap on future debt repayments as soon as Labour or a Labour-led coalition is in government. All debts would be cancelled for students who began studying in the previous year.The result of the current bungled system is that the government may retroactively change the repayment terms of student loans and sell them off below their value to serve the financial sector, or meet its own superficial budget targets. That’s not fair.But defenders of the system claim abolishing tuition fees is not practical, nor affordable. That disingenuous framing is an attempt to disguise a question of fairness – of who should pay – as a question of what is possible. The question of whether we can afford higher education has already been decided (we can). As we now know, loans cost far more than paying by general taxation. Funding university education via taxation, therefore, is a progressive shift in the burden of payment for an existing service.We are told that abolishing fees would require eye-watering tax increases. This is utterly misleading. Given that student loan repayments under the present system are a quasi-graduate tax, all that is needed is a change to make taxation more egalitarian, not an increase.Do our proposals sound radical? They shouldn’t. People across the rest of Europe pity England for our student loans and fees.To be fair to Augar, the only way to truly review post-18 education would have been to ignore May’s preconditions and propose something more radical.Meanwhile, in the US, the presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders proposes to “completely wipe out the student loan debt of every single American”. The price tag would be $1.6tn (£1.28tn), paid for by a new tax on Wall Street. Our idea is more modest. We’re not suggesting a full cancellation of outstanding debt. We are simply proposing the fairest and most economically efficient way out of this mess."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790dc6cf26b7cb4242bacdb07310df216eb2a5e0/0_119_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a7d8225049490313c9c199590248e07","title":"how we met i ran up to her car window and she couldnt remember how to open it","story":"Ian Rickett, 31, a farmer, and Elsa Trueman, 27, who works at the National Holocaust Centre and Museum, live in Nottinghamshire. They met at a Young Farmers’ Club meetingElsa and Ian first met at the pre-schoolers’ group their mothers attended, although Elsa, four years younger than Ian, was just a baby. Then they were at the same school, but didn’t know each other. And although Elsa had grown up on a farm just 10 minutes from Ian’s village, where his parents have a smallholding, they never socialised. She had never been particularly interested in joining the Young Farmers’ Club that Ian was involved in.That changed when Elsa came home after university and wanted to make some new local friends. It was November 2017 and she went to her first Young Farmers’ meeting – the group’s AGM, and Ian’s last night as chairman. “I saw her and that was just it, really. I thought: ‘Oh right, hello,’” he says.He saw her leave at the end and ran after her. “She’d just got in her car. I ran up to her window, and she couldn’t remember how to open it. I stood there doing the old ‘wind it down’ thing.”“It didn’t have a winder,” says Elsa.Ian continues: “So she opens the door straight into my face. That was it. We swapped phone numbers that night. I just said: ‘A few of us are going to the pub it would be nice if you joined us, meet a few people.’”Elsa didn’t go, but they spent the week texting each other and a week later, they met for a date. Ian works long hours on a farm so it was late when they got to Rufford Abbey country park, in Nottinghamshire at midnight they were still walking round the lake.Since then, they say, they have been inseparable. “Whenever any of my friends meet Ian they say if they could draw a picture to describe what my perfect partner would be, Ian is exactly that,” says Elsa. “Ian is really kind I don’t think I’ve met anyone as kind as him. He just gives off an aura of happiness.” Ian likes that they “have the same level of humour, the same values”.They are doing up a cottage they managed to buy at auction but the dream is to run a farm together. “I said: ‘I’d like a bit of land, some tractors, some animals, my own business,’” says Ian. “I expected Elsa to say: ‘I’m not having that,’ but she said: ‘I like the sound of that.’ So that’s what we’re aiming for, putting a bit away and saving up.” Elsa says: “My parents have got a farm. I’ve got two sisters, but neither of them are interested in farming, so I think my dad was quite happy when he knew Ian was a farmer.”They got engaged in August last year. Elsa does modelling part-time, often shooting covers for romantic or period novels, which Ian gets roped into doing, too (“All of a sudden I’m dressed as Henry VIII,” he says). Ian got one of the photographers to help with the proposal, setting up a fake shoot at the country park where they had their first date. “On the day, it was raining a bit so we were driving to this shoot, and Ian was getting more and more worked up,” says Elsa. “I was like: ‘It’s fine – the worst that can happen is we’ll cancel the shoot.’”They set a picnic scene below an oak tree, and when Elsa turned around, Ian was holding a ring. “And he gave me a little speech,” she says. Ian continues: “About how much I love her and how much she means to me. She looked me square in the eyes and said: ‘Is this a prop?’”“I thought it wasn’t real,” she says. “I thought: ‘I’m going to say yes and he’s going to laugh at me.’”They are getting married in a few weeks in Ian’s village, followed by a blessing in the church in Elsa’s village down the road, then a reception on the farm. They will probably be travelling by tractor.Want to share your story?

Overpriced breakfast sandwiches and bawling toddlers feature high on the list, but André 3000 pootling around playing a 40-minute flute solo isn’t usually a contender.And yet that’s exactly what happened last month, with podcast producer Antonia Cereijido spotting the Outkast man strolling from gate to gate, casually going to town on a handcrafted Mayan wind instrument like the low-key legend he is. Of course, this isn’t the kind of moment that can pass without some sort of social media validation. Her joyous selfie with The King of Wind – as he shall now be known – has now been liked almost 400,000 times.Flutes, you see, are currently having what’s known as “a bit of a moment”. Sure, they might be one of the world’s oldest-known pieces of kit for bashing out a tune on – the drum, obvs, takes the top spot here – but their time is now.The flute’s brightest champion is the rapper Lizzo, who also just so happens to be a classically trained player. Her long silver sidekick Sasha Flute even has its own Instagram account with an extremely decent 130,000 followers. Sasha can be found at @sashabefluting if you wanna give her a follow and see the flute’s many joyful adventures, including outings with Gucci sunglasses and Nando’s takeaway bag. Truly, Sasha is living the rock star dream. Sasha recently joined Lizzo for her most fabulous outing yet, during her BET awards performance of Truth Hurts, which not only saw her twerking on a giant wedding cake but scoring a standing ovation from Rihanna and – maybe even more excitingly – the headline “Lizzo’s BET 2019 flute performance is a whole vibe” from the bad boys of ClassicFM.“Lizzo transcends all kinds of stereotypes,” explains Lisa Nelsen, acting chair of the British Flute Society and steadfast Lizzo stan. “The flute gang are pretty ready to show off what we can do. Pop, classical, beatbox – we’ve got our fingers in lots of pots.”Earlier this year, Will Ferrell even took Ron Burgundy out of semi-retirement to accept Lizzo’s jazz-flute challenge. She countered with a shot-for-shot recreation of Anchorman’s seminal club scene, set to her single Juice. 1-0 to Lizzo.Norwegian-Mexican-American ambient artist Carmen Villain is also getting in on the action, making flute a key part of her dreamy new album Both Lines Will Be Blue. The playing comes courtesy of Johanna Scheie Orellana – formerly of Oslo electropop trio Sassy 009 – who has a particularly spiritual reasoning behind her love of the instrument.“Playing is a very physical and intimate experience because you have to create the sound within your body, almost like a singer,” she explains. “Sometimes I imagine that the airstream comes straight from my soul itself.” Rather than bashing out instantly iconic R\u0026ampB hits like Lizzo, Orellana’s approach to Villain’s album is way more avant garde. “In one of the songs I’m blowing air through the instrument without any tone. When I listen to it now, I can hear my own vulnerability in the melodies.”So that’s your artsy and hip-hop bases covered, but flautism has broken through into the middle American mainstream, too. America’s Got Talent host and secret flautist Terry Crews just joined a contestant on the show for a shirtless flute duet of Ginuwine’s Pony, much to Simon Cowell’s shock and abject horror. The contestant, sadly, did not make it through to the next round, but a life of mid-range Las Vegas hotel appearances surely awaits.It is also true that pop’s fascination with the flute is nothing new. If you can, please forget Jethro Tull’s Ian Anderson balancing on one leg with flute perched coyly against his pursed lips and instead focus on someone altogether more magical. “I remember Prince coming out with Gett Off in the 90s and there was a fabulous flute lick in it,” recalls Nelsen. “I had to learn it to get my students to do it.”Honourable mentions must also go to the fluttering sample in Beastie Boys’ Sure Shot, the Mamas and the Papas’ California Dreamin’ and Justin Bieber’s unhealthy obsession with pan flutes: see everything he ever released in 2015.

The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a76d80e489963ae45bcb555f88ec2b9a863a7ace/150_355_3108_1865/master/3108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=262f7d605e02781db0703192ab9b5fd8","title":"what really happens to the waste in your recycling bin podcast","story":"Recycling is often cited as one of the easiest ways to make a difference to the environment.

What’s in a manifesto is a debate for another day,” the source said.Barring any major intervention, the surprise consensus among trade unions including Unite, GMB, Unison, Aslef and Usdaw is likely to force any remaining sceptics to agree to the new position when the shadow cabinet meets on Tuesday.Several shadow cabinet sources said the policy had the hallmarks of being approved by the Labour leader’s office and said it “would not be watered down” – though some shadow ministers are likely to push for an even stronger position.Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who has regularly clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over the party’s Brexit position, tweeted: “Remain is who we are. Our values are remain, our hearts are remain. Today is a step in the right direction but members and supporters are clear that any kind of Brexit gives us less than we have now and Labour should not support it.”Union leaders had met on Monday to agree a common position on Labour’s Brexit policy, in a meeting one source described as fractious but ultimately consensual.The proposed policy, which will be offered to the Labour leadership as the unanimous view of the unions, will say:A senior Labour source said Corbyn had not been present at the meeting but suggested it was a helpful outcome. “Jeremy has been working to unite the party and the wider Labour movement around a common position,” the source said.Union sources close to the talks said they did not want the position to be presented as an out-and-out victory for remain campaigners, saying the party would still have a chance to tell leave voters it would honour the result of the 2016 referendum by negotiating a Brexit deal if in government.“Ultimately everybody just wants this to end,” one union source said. “It would be an error to let this drag on until conference and have the battle on the conference floor. But it is right to reserve the position on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal which could deliver the result of the 2016 referendum. It would be mad to say we would negotiate a deal and then campaign against it.”One union source said the meeting had been lengthy but amicable and its purpose had been to find a consensus. “We are pleased and confident that everything is on the right road,” the source said.A briefing war has erupted over the past few weeks as some shadow cabinet ministers suggested senior Corbyn aides and union figures such as McCluskey were preventing the party moving to an explicitly pro-remain position or championing the change in party policy.On Sunday, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, denied claims he had been urging Corbyn to sack his two most senior aides, Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne, because they were opposed to Labour committing to backing remain in a second referendum.Labour had already shifted its Brexit stance to propose that any Brexit deal passed by parliament should be put to the people in a second referendum, after the party suffered heavy losses to the pro-remain Liberal Democrats at the local and European elections.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, had previously said publicly she was “beginning to worry” about party policy not being sufficiently pro-remain.Labour MPs at a private meeting of parliamentarians on Monday night expressed some caution about the new policy.“It is not exactly the absolute clarity we were hoping for,” one MP said. “It sounds like we are reserving the right to campaign for remain against our own Brexit deal – that will just sound ludicrous to voters.”The party came under attack for the policy from both sides of the Brexit ide as the trade union agreement emerged. The Conservatives called it “an attempt to frustrate Brexit and ignore the democratic mandate to deliver it”.The Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said: “Even now, after millions of remainers have deserted them, Labour manage only a fudge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25f5f990cd1f5b7b463802c7a8865f9f6fcc221d/0_152_3463_2079/master/3463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e7f7a20ae147ae7268384b15c253350","title":"grieve proroguing parliament would be end of democracy in uk","story":"Tory rebel defends amendment that would prevent Commons shutdown for no-deal BrexitProroguing the House of Commons to achieve a no-deal Brexit would be “the end of parliamentary democracy” in the UK, Dominic Grieve has said in defending his move to seek to remove the option.Grieve’s amendment, which has cross-party support including from a handful of fellow Conservative MPs, is to the Northern Ireland bill going through the Commons, and would require fortnightly reports on that country’s formation of an executive, which has been vacant since 2017.Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Grieve said the amendment calls for “regular motions before parliament in September and particularly October”. If passed, it would prevent the parliamentary session being prorogued, or abruptly ended, in the lead-up to the 31 October departure date.Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues Parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen\u0027s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills which have been passed during that session, and summarises what has been achieved.It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.\u0026nbspParliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen\u0027s Speech at the formal State Opening of Parliament.Grieve, a former attorney general, said “the idea that it is constitutionally proper to prorogue parliament as a device for bringing about a no-deal Brexit is outrageous … I have never come across a more extraordinary suggestion.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to replace Theresa May and become the new prime minister, has said he is not in favour of prorogation, telling the Daily Mail: “I’m not attracted to archaic political devices.” Grieve noted, however, that the “this extraordinary idea crept in” during the course of the leadership election and Johnson “seemed to adopt it”.“It should be denounced by anybody who is planning to be the prime minister of a democratic country,” Grieve said, and Johnson “should be saying very, very clearly that there’s no possibility of proroguing parliament to achieve an aim of the executive”.He said whoever became prime minister in a country “where there are deep isions over Brexit, where the party he is leading does not have a majority in the House of Commons and is dependent on the support of another minority party” should either call a general election or “govern taking into account the opinion of the Commons”.“To try to simply disregard that opinion and to try to pretend it doesn’t exist is to court disaster.”If MPs made a stand today to prevent prorogation, it would mean they could avoid having to do something more drastic later, Grieve said.Grieve was backed by the Conservative former foreign secretary William Hague, who told Today: “I think it’s very important that parliament is able to give its opinion. It ought to be unthinkable that we could leave the EU by a manoeuvre, by a procedural ruse of some kind.“While I don’t agree with everything Dominic has said or tried to do, I sympathise with attempts to ensure that parliament can have its say.”Opponents of the amendment, such as the Tory MP Steve Baker, who is one of the leaders of the hardline European Research Group, expressed outrage that Theresa May might give Tory MPs a free vote on the amendment.“Incredibly, I understand there is some doubt about the whipping on this matter.” Baker tweeted. “Surely Theresa May won’t allow her legacy to include failing to resist dragging the Queen into politics?”He later drew attention to a newspaper story which suggested the chancellor, Philip Hammond, would support May’s legacy projects if she gave Tory rebels opportunities to vote for measures that ruled out a no-deal departure from the EU.“What a way to govern a country,” Baker tweeted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7312b82017c1a1db63ba04b3c0da56628c13276/23_611_4427_2656/master/4427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d01257516671203ee78a9e2363a0d8e3","title":"home office applies good character test to children as young as 10","story":"Human rights committee says children who have grown up in UK are being denied citizenshipChildren who have grown up in Britain are being deprived of their right to citizenship because of the “heavy-handed” approach taken by immigration officials, a parliamentary committee has said.The “good character” test is being applied so strictly that it is even affecting youngsters who have no criminal convictions, according to the joint committee on human rights (JCHR).The committee’s report, which scrutinises the government’s proposed changes to the British Nationality Act 1981, raises concerns about immigration control practices.A police caution or minor offence could mean that a child who has grown up in the UK may be denied British citizenship, the MPs and peers warned.The study follows a report in the  last year based on freedom of information requests, which found that on average one child a week has had their application rejected over the last five years.Campaigners estimated that as many as 400 children had been denied citizenship for failing to satisfy the good character requirement since it was introduced in 2006.The committee investigation noted that during the past decade “good character requirements have been extended to apply to children who are entitled to be British citizens due to their close connection with the UK”.The report said: “It is inappropriate to apply the good character requirement to young children with a right to be British, where the United Kingdom is the only country they know and where they have grown up their whole lives here.”Evidence heard by the committee showed that good character tests affected children as young as 10 who had lived all their lives in the UK.MPs and peers were also critical of the high fees charged for applications, which can cost up to four figures. “This means the government is asking children for fees that are more than three times the cost recovery for processing such an application,” the committee said. “The committee is concerned that disproportionately high fees could risk excluding children from more vulnerable socio-economic backgrounds from accessing their rights.”The Home Office is urged to review its proposed changes to the law and act “without delay” to ensure a fair, non-discriminatory approach to UK nationality law.“The application of good character requirements to children raises concerns that the rights of the child – and in particular the requirement that the best interests of the child be a primary consideration – are not being respected in the application of nationality law to children living in the UK,” the study said.Cuts to legal aid have compounded the problem. “It is now harder than ever for iniduals to obtain the advice they need to be able to access justice and enforce their human rights,” the committee concluded.“This can be all the more important relating to citizenship rights as these touch upon the very identity of a person and their rights to live in the country where they were born, have grown up and with which they identify and have their cultural links and identity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad6c89b1153e4a2245c678e4eb8dbe0e7138328/0_188_3508_2104/master/3508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a68e6668d3c55d1342b5898e1a9987c4","title":"couple sues fertility clinic ivf mix up","story":"New York couple is suing a Los Angeles fertility clinic after woman gives birth to other couples’ babiesA couple from New York is taking legal action against a fertility clinic claiming their IVF treatment left them pregnant with twins who were unrelated to them or each other.According to a lawsuit filed in New York by the married couple – referred to only as AP and YZ to “minimise the embarrassment and humiliation already caused” – they sought the services of CHA Fertility in Los Angeles last year after years of trying to conceive without success.When, in September 2018, the couple, from Flushing, New York, were told that they were expecting twin girls, they were “ecstatic”, according to the lawsuit.But, it states, the couple were “confused” when at their three and five-month sonograms they were told they were, in fact, carrying two boys.It adds: “Defendant Berger and Defendant Hong assured Plaintiffs that they were having girls and that nothing was wrong.”But after the birth, it says, they were “shocked” to discover the two boys did not appear to be related to them.It reads: “On March 31, 2019, Plaintiff AP gave birth via caesarean section to two male babies, neither of which was of Asian descent.”The lawsuit states that representatives of the defendants went to New York to meet the couple in hospital. The couple agreed for themselves and their babies to undergo DNA tests, which confirmed that they were not genetically related to the children and that the two boys were not related to each other. They then had to “relinquish custody” of the children.“Subsequently, the testing revealed that Baby A was genetically matched to Couple A and Baby B was genetically matched to Couple B…As a result, Plaintiffs were required to relinquish custody of Baby A and Baby B, thus suffering the loss of two children,” it reads.According to the lawsuit, the couple do not know what happened to their own two embryos, which they believe “were never thawed andor lost or destroyed by Defendants”.Attorneys acting on behalf of the couple have filed a complaint and demand for jury trial on 16 counts – including medical malpractice, negligence, reckless and wanton misconduct and deceit and fraudulent concealment.It states: “Plaintiffs have suffered significant and permanent emotional injuries for which they will not recover…In addition, Plaintiff AP underwent physical and emotional injuries for which she is still under the treatment of medical providers and will continue to be in the future.”The lawsuit claims the treatment cost the couple spent “in excess of $100,000” on the treatment in charges including doctors’ and facility fees, medication, travel and specialist services.CHA Fertility did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20c28e9b905a3837f4c849092ae4cdde647184b7/0_128_3284_1971/master/3284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b22616e19cd3c1ffc0a8f369db9152a1","title":"irresponsible firms exposing children to gambling study finds","story":"Research found companies were not doing enough to stop exposure to ads on social mediaGambling companies have been branded “irresponsible” after a major study found they are not doing enough to stop children seeing their adverts online, particularly on Twitter.The research, led by Ipsos Mori, found that an estimated 41,000 children under 16 follow gambling-related accounts, while children replied to or retweeted those accounts 13,000 times.While children were not being directly targeted, the report said some of the ads included features likely to appeal to them, while little was being done to screen them out of gambling ads.The study comes several months after figures emerged suggesting a rise in numbers of child problem gamblers, reaching 50,000, prompting allegations of a “generational scandal”.Some of the UK’s leading bookmakers and online casino firms have since promised to invest more in addiction treatment and to curb adverts on TV.But the research highlighted the prevalence of gambling adverts on the internet, particularly social media sites such as Twitter.The researchers created 11 “avatars”, fake internet user profiles with identities such as “problem gambler” or a “child under 13”, based on browsing history.The “child under 13” avatar saw more online gambling adverts per month than the adult with a gambling problem. Both saw more than a neutral avatar with no browsing history.The report said there was “no evidence” that advertisers had taken significant steps to screen out children and gambling addicts, such as by analysing their browsing history.Adverts on TV and online also contained features likely to appeal to children such as celebrities or cartoon-like characters, particularly in adverts for eSports.Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, said: “It’s no wonder we have so many children gambling when irresponsible gambling companies are placing adverts that appeal to kids.“The explosion of gambling advertising in recent years is fuelling problem gambling. If we are going to tackle addiction we need to start by tackling adverts.”The interim report is part of a longer study commissioned by a leading gambling charity in the UK, GambleAware. The final report will chart the impact that gambling ads are having on children.During the study, researchers interviewed young people and problem gamblers about their exposure to adverts.One person aged between 16 and 17 said: “You are always going to know the Ladbrokes. It’s like McDonalds, it is always there.”Analysis of live sports on television found that gambling companies adverts are particularly prominent during football matches.During one game between Scottish teams Rangers and Celtic, there were 920 occasions on which gambling brands were visible, one every 10 seconds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371fff8cd77ce94ac6dd21f0fc63b0c69d8ea46b/0_284_5015_3008/master/5015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b98a99534a4acc5758382052f4bbb475","title":"india v new zealand cricket world cup 2019 semi final live","story":"1st over: New Zealand 0-0 (Guptill 0, Nicholls 0) The consensus is that this is an excellent batting pitch. There’s some swing for Kumar, however, and Guptill is beaten later in the over when he gropes at a wider outswinger. A maiden to start.In fact it was missing leg stump, so Guptill survives and India lose their review. That would have been his third golden duck of the tournament.Quite a start, this. Guptill pushed around his front pad at Bhuvneshwar Kumar and survived a huge LBW shout. Virat Kohli reviewed with three seconds remaining. It was close, perilously close, but I reckon this will umpire’s call at best for India.The anthems are done, the India players are in their pre-match huddle. In the words of Neville Cardus, let’s get ready to rumble.“Morning Rob,” says Nick Parish. “I present three of your own comments for your learned perusal. First, New Zealand are the only team to reach the semi-finals of the last four World Cups. Second, New Zealand have never won the World Cup. Third, New Zealand have spent decades showing the folly of underestimating them. I’d argue that given the first, the second refutes the third. Discuss.”I’m not sure it refutes it, but I suppose it discredits it. But they are the most underratedpatronised team in world cricket.“Whilst NZ’s slump in the past couple of weeks, the positive has to be that the players who looked to be struggling for form in the earlier weeks – Neesham, de Grandhomme and even Latham – seem to be hitting their straps now,” says Richard O’Hagan. “If Henry could just do the same they’ll be in with a real chance. And surely the fates won’t allow the CWC careers of Taylor and Guptill to end on a rainy Tuesday in Manchester? Or am I just grasping at straws here?”You are, but just look at those straws! I don’t think this game is a foregone conclusion, though India are clear favourites. Everyone thinks they are going to lose, so New Zealand should treat it as a freebie – stop worrying and, this being Old Trafford, attack attack attack.India prefer Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Yuzvendra Chahal to Mohammad Shami and Kuldeep Yadav. Ravindra Jadeja also keeps his place. New Zealand’s team is as expected, with Lockie Ferguson returning from injury to replace Tim Southee..Kane Williamson says he considered bowling because of the overhead conditions, but that it looks like a good surface. Runs on the board, etc, etc. Virat Kohli says he would have also have batted first.“Good Morning Rob!” says Kevin Usher. “Long time listener, first time caller... Given that it occurs after both semi-finals are over (English weather notwithstanding), and two days before the final itself, what’s the significance of the draw on Friday?”It’s an in-joke, with myself, based on the below from Vic Marks in the Observer in 1993.On the field the Australians have humbled us the Oval excepted, the cricket has been too one-sided to provoke prolonged excitement over the airwaves. Hence there have been more japes than usual and we can takr solace in at least one minor English victory. It took place at Edgbaston when Baxter passed a note to Neville Oliver on air, which he dutifully read out - “There will be full coverage of the NatWest semi-finals on Tuesday, and on Wednesday the draw for the final will be made live on Radio 5”.The first email “It is good to start a knockout match as underdogs,” says Krishnamoorthy V. “An early loss of Rohit Sharma and some tight bowling will send India into a panic. NZ should try starting with a spinner (a la Dipak Patel in 1992).”I wouldn’t do that today – these look like great swing-bowling conditions.Links. Lots of linksIt’s been a bat-first tournament - 16 of the last 20 games have been won that way - but New Zealand must be tempted to bowl first if they win the toss. It’s overcast, which suits Trent Boult, and their best chance of winning the game is probably to put India in and take early wickets. That’s the only consideration, right?The weather forecast isn’t the best: cloudy turning to light rain at lunchtime. There is a reserve day for both semi-finals, although they are a last resort. We could still have, for example, a 20-over match today or on Thursday. This explains it in a little more detail, although it doesn’t completely satisfy me that there is no potential for farce.Good morning. The Cricket World Cup is the tournament that always leaves the audience wanting less. The group stages are a tough mudder for supporters – a draining test of endurance, nerve, commitment, caffeine levels and ability to understand how net run-rate works. They must be quite hard to play in as well.The group stages were good to middling, saved by Sri Lanka’s win over England. But now, after 40 days and 41 matches, we’ve reached the really good bit: the knockout stages. India play New Zealand in the first semi-final at Old Trafford today. Then, on Thursday at Edgbaston, Australia and England will compare testosterone levels. The draw for the final will take place on Friday, with the two teams meeting at Lord’s on Sunday.We will either have a familiar winner of the tournament (Australia for the sixth time, India for the third) or a new one. New Zealand and England have never won the World Cup, as you may have have heard one of two million times in the last six weeks. New Zealand are at least the world champions of consistency. They are the only team to reach the semi-finals at the last four World Cups, and if they win today they will reach their second final in a row. We’re all friends, so let’s speak frankly: nobody really gives New Zealand a prayer today. That, I suspect, is more down to form than the predilection to underestimate a team who have spent decades showing the folly of underestimating them.New Zealand lost their last three games in the league stage, and a number of their players have had poor tournament. Their hope comes in the form of Kane Williamson, Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson, all potential matchwinners, and the fact they hammered India in a warm-up match at the end of May. The league match between the two sides was rained off, so there are no clues there.India managed to finish top of the league without being quite at their best. Jasprit Bumrah and Rohit Sharma were immense, but Virat Kohli didn’t score a century (he’s still averaging 63 in the tournament) and they have yet to settle on their preferred XI.Maybe they never will. Time is running out, but in a good way. India – and the other three semi-finalists – are only two games away from winning the World Cup.Today’s match starts at 10.30am local time, 3pm in Mumbai, 9.30pm in Wellington."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2b01220b0feb5af353bd94e6a0523349da7d667/0_106_3189_1914/master/3189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67c58a0089f124aea8d624342ddd5d0c","title":"how we made closer patrick marber clive owen","story":"‘I wanted to write a Shakespearean scene with someone in disguise, so I went into a lesbian chatroom pretending to be a gay woman’I was in Atlanta in 1996 with a tour of my play Dealer’s Choice and I was dragged along to a lap-dancing club.

Nothing like the urban environment of the play. I wrote on a Toshiba laptop, a machine with a tiny screen that now looks like a piece of hilarity from the late 80s. It was my lucky computer. I wrote Alan Partridge and Dealer’s Choice on it. I’d work from 9pm to 5am then sleep until midday. It was brain-crackingly hard doing the plotting.I wanted a sort of Shakespearean scene, with someone in disguise, so spent an hour in a cyber cafe and went into a lesbian chatroom pretending to be a gay woman. I just wanted to impersonate someone else. Then, while walking my dog in Postman’s Park in London, I stumbled on a memorial for Alice Ayres who saved three children from a burning house. I thought one of my characters could take her name. In the play, Alice saves Anna, Dan and Larry in a way. I knew Dan would be an obituarist and at one point my title was An Obituary for Alice Ayres. Not very racy. I took Closer from a Joy Division album. The designer Vicki Mortimer and I set the play downstage and decided props would gradually be dumped upstage as a reminder of more innocent times for the characters. Some thought it looked like a junk shop, but I didn’t mind. It is a play about the terrible junk of jealousy, breakups, orce and singleness.Sam Mendes was going to direct but had to pull out. I’d directed Dealers’ Choice and felt ready to do it myself. When we opened in the National Theatre’s Cottesloe theatre I was really scared. It didn’t seem funny at all, just relentlessly grim. I was surprised when it got good reviews. By the time it closed on Broadway in 1999, I’d devoted three years to the play. It was so heavily reviewed and scrutinised that it was nice to tinker with it for each production, reminding myself I still owned this thing. Liza Walker stayed with it a long time – playing Alice at the National’s Cottesloe and then Lyttelton theatres, and then in the West End.Clive Owen was Dan in the Cottesloe. He found a way of honouring all the cynicism of the character while mining dark, ironic humour. Then he played Larry in Mike Nichols’s film and got an Oscar nomination. When it was shot in London, I experienced the strangeness of there being a movie crew in little Postman’s Park. It’s odd how life works out: you stumble on a thing, put it in a play and years later hundreds of people are there rigging.Patrick played cards with people I knew. Some of them inspired characters in Dealer’s Choice. Closer was one of the most exciting, visceral pieces of writing I’d read. I really wanted to play Larry, but Patrick thought I was too young. Ciarán Hinds was cast in that role but I got a message from my agent: would I like to play Dan instead? Yes, I would.My strongest memory is Dan’s softness. Larry rips him apart and he is really exposed. He is in love with the idea of being in love and just has a brutal awakening. Closer is such an honest examination of the pain from relationships and what it feels like to be bereft. It was as if we were going into the unknown. The internet chatroom scene, where the dialogue appears on a huge screen, felt very state of the art. We got great reviews and the play became a big thing but we had walkouts, too. It starts almost like a romantic comedy – witty and light – then slowly you’re pulled into something deeply unsettling. There’s a big scene that goes into the explicit details of the affair. Some people found that too much.The impact was so powerful in the Cottesloe. I remember walking into the empty Lyttelton, where it was going to transfer into, and felt that I had loved the experience so much that I didn’t want to do it in the bigger space, so I left after the initial run.Years later, I got a call from Mike Nichols asking if I wanted to play Larry. A part I’d really wanted was suddenly being offered to me, with an amazing director and cast.As an actor you look at every piece from your character’s perspective. You read a play or film with one character in mind. To play two parts in a piece like Closer was a totally new thing for me. I knew the play, the rhythms of the language, the impact of certain things but was now looking from Larry’s perspective. It felt both new and familiar. It was like I’d been given the most incredible gift.• Patrick Marber is directing Leopoldstadt at Wyndham’s theatre, London, 25 January-16 May 2020.

Radio Times readers voted it the TV moment of 2015.Turner said while he never felt personally objectified, it enabled him to have more empathy towards women who have found themselves in a similar position.The Irish actor told the Radio Times: “I’m a man. It’s just not the same. It’s a completely different world for me. I walk down the street, I don’t ever feel scared. There are women who feel scared every day. It’s a very different world for me.“If I go to a BFI screening and 20 women come up and they want selfies, it can sometimes get a little hands-on. But I never feel like my safety is in question. I never feel like I need to get out of there. I don’t get scared, so it’s different. Whereas a woman might, if it happened with 20 guys crowding around her.”The fifth series of Poldark begins on Sunday at 9pm on BBC One and will run for eight episodes.Turner said the public were generally kind to him and he did not receive too much hassle from admirers and people who recognised him.“When the show is on television you get recognised a bit more,” he said. “That’s the great thing about audiences: they’re brilliantly fickle. They’re gorgeously fickle. We all are. You’re popular when you’re on television but when you’re not no one really cares about you. So that’s useful, I suppose.“I certainly don’t get hassled. Maybe on a Friday or Saturday night in a pub at one o’clock in the morning – people have a few drinks, all it takes is for one person to see you and then tell their mates – but people are generally really kind. I’m grateful for it.”The fifth series is expected to be the last, though the writer Debbie Horsfield has said there is a possibility the show could return as there are still five books of the 12-part series left to cover.

But don’t panic. These hacks, says Susie Mesure, can help you become a time lordWho doesn’t dream of having more hours in the day to get stuff done? Sadly, until quantum scientists figure out how to reverse time, we’re stuck with having to manage with what we have.Trouble is, the world of time management can sometimes seem a bit, well, time-consuming. There are so many different techniques and systems, from sophisticated activity logs and minute-by-minute scheduling, to synchronised software and apps.Luckily, there are a number of quick and easy life hacks and mental tricks to help blitz your to-do list.A key thing is to try to be aware of the value of each passing moment. “Remember every task comes with a cost,” says Ellen Hendriksen, host of the podcast Savvy Psychologist and author of How to Be Yourself: “Be mindful about what task you are choosing to spend your time on because that is time spent not only on doing that task, but on not doing other tasks.”Another way to make yourself more aware is to first picture in your head your ideal working day – epitomising optimum levels of productivity and downtime. Then compare it to how your actual day is panning out. This will you give an idea of how and where you’re falling short.Kelsey also swears by limiting interruptions from telephone calls or emails using your travel time efficiently not overcommitting yourself and curtailing the time spent in meetings. He also suggests keeping a diary so you can spot where you might be going off-piste. Another, obvious, tip is to delete any social media apps from your phone – we all know they’re like catnip, and a quick scroll can easily cost you half an hour.Hendriksen suggests slimming down to-do lists to include only small, specific tasks. “If we are staring at 10 huge things, especially a large number of non-specific things, such as ‘clean the house’, ‘finish project’ or ‘figure out work presentation’, then those large tasks will seem overwhelming. So keep your to-do list to more defined things.”Other simple techniques include tackling trickier or more boring tasks first, like ticking off your business admin, so you finish them faster.One – arguably masochistic – tip is to replace your clock with a timer – even an hourglass or egg timer – to make your deadline feel more menacing. Or, if that sounds too stressful, use the stopwatch app on your phone and challenge yourself to speed up each time you do something repetitive.Another approach to time management is to focus your mind not on the value of each passing hour, but rather on the value or importance of each task. Indeed, self-help types often reference a matrix, based on a quote attributed to US president Dwight Eisenhower: “I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.”Stephen Covey, in his 1989 book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, says the matrix comprises four boxes: urgent and important not urgent but important urgent but not important and not urgent and not important. The idea behind it is straightforward: by thinking about where your task sits within the quadrant, you should be better able to notice whether or not you’re wasting your time.Kelsey points out that it can be helpful to think of time management as something to continually struggle with, rather than as something that can be mastered or cured. “It’s worth noting that I wrote these books from the perspective of being a sufferer, someone who struggles with issues like time management,” he says.Whatever your business, don’t keep knocking essential tasks to the bottom of your to-do list.Tailor your business insurance with AXA. It couldn’t be simpler. That’s one less thing to worry about, and more time to spend getting on with business.

In the streets of San José, they continue to feel President Ortega’s reachThis project was produced by Dawning, an organization devoted to investigative journalism. It is an independent effort, self-funded, non-partisan and non-ideological, in the tradition of journalism in the public interest.Forty years ago, Daniel Ortega and his wife Rosario Murillo hid together in safe houses around Costa Rica’s capital while waiting for the imminent fall of the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza. Today, thousands of their exiled compatriots hide in the same city, San José, awaiting the fall of the presidential couple.Nicaraguan exiles come from every walk of life. All of them have one thing in common: if they returned home, they say they would be arrested, tortured, or killed. They are some of Ortega’s most wanted.Victor Barrantes, Costa Rica’s vice-minister of government and police, says “the government has no concrete evidence that would suggest that Nicaraguan paramilitary or counter-intelligence groups are operating in our country. However, we are investigating, as we do receive complaints.” In this project, based on over 50 interviews over a four-month period in San José and Managua, we hear their voices and see their faces, as they recount their wounds and hopes in the midst of great uncertainty.When the protests began in April 2018, Dr Estrada left his job to serve as a medic in a makeshift clinic in his native Monimbo, an emblematic locale since the Sandinista revolution. “We used restaurant tables, a tent, and some stretchers. In 88 days, we treated about 2,000 people. We hardly slept. But it felt good to serve my town.” On 17 July, 2018, government forces regained control of Monimbo, and Dr Estrada walked for six days towards the Costa Rican border. “I received money to maintain the barricades, and now the government is accusing me of funding terrorism.”Unable to find a job in San José, Dr Estrada lives off donations. “It’s a slow but sure death if I continue here. I don’t want to die in exile without seeing my family again. Ortega is destroying us.”“Vice-president Murillo issued an order offering us $5,000 per kill during the protests. But I refused to participate in that massacre.” The 35-year old officer spoke on condition of anonymity. After refusing orders, he was captured and taken to El Chipote prison in April 2018. “Everyone was naked and crying.” Over 16 days he was raped and mutilated and, suffered electroshocks to his genitals. Three toenails were removed, his jaw dislocated, and two teeth yanked out. “They took me and four others, threw us into Tiscapa lagoon and shot at us. I don’t know where I got the strength from, but I started running.”He was found by students. After recovering in Jinotega, he and his wife crossed the border. He is undergoing psychological treatment.“San José is infested with Nicaraguan intelligence. I don’t want to live in fear, but I can’t sleep at night.”Ericka was the leader of a barricade in her native Masaya. She was captured and taken to El Chipote. “They forced me to take photos in front of a lot of weapons, saying I was a terrorist. They hit me when I protested. They undressed and blindfolded me. I was raped by five policemen. Then they threw me into a pitch-black cell. They forced me to read a false statement on camera incriminating 15 of my neighbors.”A day later, human rights defenders helped release some prisoners, including Ericka. She returned to her barricade, where she provided food and weapons, until Masaya was taken by government forces. “My group was the last. We resisted until midday. While running to hide, I was shot in my buttocks. We killed the person who did it.”Two days later, she crossed the border and was transported to San José in an ambulance. “I live in fear. The paramilitary are here looking for me.”Raul Oporta was an active community leader in Boaco. He founded a new political party called Citizens for Freedom soon before the protests, during which he established himself as a logistical leader. Raul was arrested while sitting on his front porch. He was charged with damages against state property – which he denies – and was put on trial.“The witnesses appointed by the prosecutors and police did not want to show up in court to incriminate me because they knew it was all false”.In December 2018, only one witness testified, a neighbor. “I am convinced he was coerced to lie. With just one witness, I was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. During recess, I fled.” Disguised as a priest, he escaped to Costa Rica on motorcycle. In San José, Raul participates in political meetings of exiles to organize and discuss the future of Nicaragua.Oporta’s restaurant business in Nicaragua, currently managed by his wife, was recently denied the renovation of its alcohol license. The official letter from the Nicaraguan police states that they “will not authorize business permits for people who participated and were investigated for their actions in the failed coup”, and affirms that Raul “wants to use his business as a meeting point with the only goal of continuing his terrorist acts”.The most renowned journalist in Nicaragua, Chamorro went into exile in Costa Rica in January after police raided the offices at Confidencial, of which he is founder and editor. “We filed a lawsuit against the government for robbing us during our broadcasts of the protests. Shortly after, I appeared as one of the first names on a notice of capture. But I’ve been persecuted these last 10 years. There is massive repression of news channels in Nicaragua.”In San José, Chamorro continues working on stories, now broadcast via YouTube. “I am optimistic about the crisis resolving itself through political means. But a quick exit isn’t just going to fall from the sky. We need the international community to reach a negotiation with or without Ortega.”Leticia, one of the most visible faces in the channel, covered the protests since April and, on multiple occasions, was assaulted and had equipment confiscated or broken.While traveling to cover protests in Ticuantepe in June, her station van was intercepted. “They ransacked our vehicle and stole everything. The entire time they held an AK-47 to my head and whispered lewd sexual comments in my ear.”“Ortega has tried to silence us, but we continue reporting from here.”In January 2019, the government asked Canal 12 to stop broadcasting all programs by Carlos Chamorro. That same month, over 30 police officers entered the studio and asked journalists to present their identification.Rafael Solis was considered one of Ortega’s closest allies for decades, but his public renunciation letter described Nicaragua as a “dictatorship”. Solis championed the controversial legal modifications to allow Ortega to run for re- election in 2011.“I made a mistake”, says Solis. “Nicaragua needs a profound judicial reform, or even a new constitution. And we need a truth commission to investigate everything that happened since April 2018.”Solis is hopeful about the opportunities for dialogue. “Violence will not solve this crisis. We need dialogue. But Ortega has to free all political prisoners. We need to be patient.”This is the first time Solis has been photographed in a public space in Costa Rica. “I take precautions here, but I am not afraid. I risked my life against Somoza’s dictatorship. I have faith.”“Many farmers have been killed in the past six years. What happened in April 2018 is not new to us – Ortega’s regime has consistently tried to silence us. He has sold our land to the Chinese.”Nemesio was responsible for the national coordination of the farmers’ barricades.“We faced a lot of crises because we had different views on how to approach the protests. We don’t agree with violence.” In July, with his town under heavy attack, Nemesio fled.“We lost many people that day. I don’t know if they’re alive, dead, or in jail.” Nemesio’s wife and children joined him in Costa Rica, but he only sees them twice a month.“This is not a safe exile for me. I know they’re trying to kill me. In a way, we are interrupting Costa Rica’s democracy, because Nicaragua is sending paramilitaries after us. Part of the Nicaraguan conflict is now here.”In July, she was three weeks pregnant when police attacked the campus of Unan, where she served as logistics manager for all 89 days of protests. “We cooked, showered and slept on campus. At night we played cards and sang songs.” For two months, María hid in three secret safe houses until her capture in late September. She was taken to El Chipote, dressed in blue prison clothes, and presented to the press by the police.“It was a total charade. I suddenly was all over the media as a dangerous delinquent.” In prison, María slept on the floor and was beaten regularly. She was denied medical attention until an ultrasound revealed her child had died. “My child was dead inside me for a week.”She was released but continued being harassed by government forces. Soon after, María arrived in Costa Rica with her mother, exactly three weeks after her 20th birthday.During the first week of protests in April, Jonas, who studied civil engineering, witnessed the deaths of 14 fellow students. “I suddenly saw myself in the middle of a war. I had never seen someone die before. I wasn’t ready.”In early May, he joined the barricades at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN), where he stayed for 77 days. “It was beautiful to see the whole city unite and support one another.” Jonas was arrested and taken to El Chipote prison. “They threw me into a cell. I was tortured every day by four masked policemen. They used electric shocks and a baseball bat. I never received food or water. I lost consciousness several times during the interrogations. On the fifth day, I pretended to faint because I knew my torturers would kill me. Luckily, they sent me to a hospital. I had four fractured ribs.”Jonas escaped the hospital and took refuge in a safe house until he crossed the border, still wearing a bandage around his ribs. “I am free here, but it’s very hard to survive in Costa Rica.”“I have been documenting the human rights violations committed by my government since the 1990s. During the first week of protests, I submitted an official report to the public ministry of Nicaragua, pointing to specific officials responsible for the deaths of 42 young people. We also know the government purposefully obscured its public morgue records during the protests.”Two months later, Leiva received a call from a friend informing him the government had filed papers declaring him a terrorist and ordering his capture.“He told me: ‘Álvaro, you need to run’.” He fled to Costa Rica with his team of human rights defenders. “I picked up dead bodies from both sides. I don’t defend parties, I defend humans. But it’s hard to remain impartial. We won’t have peace without justice.”“The police entered our office at night and stole everything we had. After that, many of our colleagues left the country horrified. But I decided to stay in Managua.”Vilma says that Cenidh is rebuilding. “Terror has not stopped. People are still imprisoned, tortured and disappeared here. Our prisons are torture centers. Our fear is not pathological: it’s real fear. The government is crushing our ability to fight. Meanwhile, our exiles in Costa Rica are facing a humanitarian crisis.”“I am not free yet. Nicaraguan exiles live like prisoners in Costa Rica. We’re trapped in a system of constant persecution. I fear for my life on the street. My mother called me three months ago to threaten me again after years of silence. If I return to Nicaragua, I am sure I would disappear.”After six years in Costa Rica, the government has not yet granted her refugee status. The embassy of Nicaragua refuses to renew her passport. “I am changing homes constantly for my own safety. But without refugee status I cannot travel outside of the country.”Zoilamérica also opened up about her father. “Ortega is dominated by fear. Losing power would mean death for him. That’s why he’s so dangerous.

The Cabinet will hear about the “dire consequences for Northern Ireland and the all-Ireland economy” according to sources familiar with the memorandums to be presented to Ministers. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is due to bring three Brexit memos to Cabinet, including a revised contingency action plan which will be published later on Tuesday. The Government is increasingly concerned about how it can reconcile the twin obligations to maintain an open border on the island while at the same time protecting the single market and customs union if the UK leaves without an agreement. Mr Coveney warned: “We can’t allow . . . Northern Ireland effectively to become a back door – if it’s unguarded – into the EU single market and customs union. Because if that happens then the Republic of Ireland will essentially get taken out of the single market by default and we can never allow that to happen.” The Taoiseach said tariffs and customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit would not need Border checks but that checks on food products and animals were a difficulty. “We’ve made no preparations for infrastructure,” he said. Tourism and medicineThe contingency plan, about 100-pages long, is an update of the plan published last December before the previous Brexit deadline of March 29th. It will cover preparations in about 20 areas, including aviation, road haulage, retail, tourism and medicines. There will also be a memo describing preparations at ports and airports. According to sources familiar with its content, the memo will approve the permanent structures at airports and ports, including Dublin and Rosslare Europort. The third memo will outline communications plans required to inform businesses and the public about the implications of a no-deal Brexit – an outcome Mr Coveney will tell Ministers is more likely now than at any time in the past. Officials are concerned that while there was a take-up of Brexit preparations and requirements in advance of the March deadline – which passed when the UK was granted an extension – there has been a fall-off in Brexit preparations by businesses since then. UK break-upOne source said the Government needed to make “an absolute wake-up call” to business, especially small and medium-sized businesses. A campaign to prompt holders of UK driving licences to apply for Irish licences is already under way.Meanwhile, the chair of Westminster’s Northern Ireland Affairs committee has warned unionists that a hard border after Brexit could lead to a united Ireland and the break-up of the United Kingdom. Conservative MP Simon Hoare said it was a huge risk to presuppose that “the cards will all fall in our favour” over Brexit in relation to the Border.“We will play with fire if a policy is pursued which adds an accelerant to a demand for a Border poll. Because I have to say, and it saddens me to say it, I am not convinced that we as unionists would win that poll,” he said“I am also certain that even if we were to prevail and that precious union was to maintain it would open yet again – and one could not refuse the request for a second independence referendum in Scotland, and it is worrying – and I say this as somebody who is saddened to say it, I do not want to wake up and find myself a subject of the United Kingdom of England and Wales.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Julien Behal Ireland cannot allow Northern Ireland to be used as a backdoor to take Ireland out of the EU by default, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.“We can’t allow, in a no-deal scenario for example, for Northern Ireland effectively to become a backdoor that’s unguarded into the European Union single market and customs union,” he said.“If that happens then the Republic of Ireland will essentially get taken out of the single market by default. We can never allow that to happen,” he said.The issue would be addressed “in probably more direct language” following the presentation of the latest Brexit preparation memos to Cabinet today, he said.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there was “no preparation in terms of structures “at the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.If there is no deal “we’ll have to protect the single market and the customs union. We’ll want to do that as well because our economy and our jobs are based on that. But we’re going to need to do it in a way that doesn’t undermine the Good Friday agreement or obligations there,” he said.Things anticipated in such a scenario could include “imposing tariffs. We know that they don’t have to be done at a border as such. Most people pay their taxes online now. But checks, obviously, is where it gets much more difficult,” he said.They were speaking to the media at Dublin Castle yesterday morning where they had launched the one-year progress report on Global Ireland 2025. The Taoiseach said it was “one of those strategies where we are well ahead of schedule – eight new embassies and consulates opened around the world.“We’ll bring three memos on Brexit to Cabinet and the main memo there really is an updated Brexit preparedness plan.”While looking forward to an early meeting with the new British prime minister, he said “the absolute red line for us is, and always has been, that we have to have a legally operable, legally binding assurance that whatever else may happen as a consequence of Brexit the re-emergence of a hard border between North and South won’t be one of them.”Great reluctanceHe also believed there would be a “great deal of reluctance” among European leaders to grant the British government another extension beyond October 31st. If such an extension was to be granted, it would be in the context of “a general election in the UK or something like that,” he said.Asked whether relations between Ireland and Britain were likely to become more fraught over coming months, Mr Coveney responded: “I hope not. I think the relationships that both the Taoiseach and I, and others in Government, have worked hard to build with the previous British cabinet were very strong.”The Taoiseach noted how both of the two men running for the Conservative Party leadership – Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt – “actually voted for the withdrawal agreement only a few weeks ago”. He said “fundamentally the best way that we can restore relations between Ireland and the UK is to come to a resolution on Brexit.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government is likely to nominate Phil Hogan, Ireland’s EU commissioner, for a second term in Brussels when it meets this morning.It is expected Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will ask Ministers to approve the nomination of Mr Hogan when the Cabinet meets at Government Buildings.Mr Hogan, who has been Agriculture Commissioner for the past five years, has been tipped for a heavyweight post in the new Commission, with speculation in Brussels centring on the trade portfolio. This would be especially relevant to Ireland with a trade deal due to be thrashed out with the UK once it leaves the EU.EU leaders decided to nominate the German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen as President of the incoming Commission. Although she must be approved by the vote of the Parliament, expected next week, it is expected that countries will scramble to nominate their Commissioners in the hope of securing important portfolios. With each of the 28 countries nominating a commissioner, many of the portfolios have limited powers and importance.However, Mr Hogan, who has held the important agriculture job for the last five year, would be expected to land one of the important roles in the Commission, and he is reported to be interested in trade. In recent days, he has strongly defended the EU’s Mercusor trade deal with south American countries, despite criticisms from the farming lobby and opposition politicians at home."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Protesters not satisfied and call for complete withdrawal of BillPeaceful campaigns and social media posts result in mysterious beatings, legal casesSeveral activists were left bloodied in the scuffles during latest extradition Bill protestsProtesters try to raise awareness among mainland Chinese visitors about political crisisRiot police baton-charge hundreds who refused to disperse following latest marchDemonstrations against extradition Bill have drawn millions to streets in recent weeks\u0026lsquoWe have nothing left to lose,\u0026rsquo shouted Hong Kong\u0026rsquos desperate, disenfranchised protestorsCharges relate to disruption of flag-raising ceremony rather than storming of legislatureThe university student lost contact with family and friends in Japan and Australia last weekStatement comes days after historic meeting between Trump and Kim in DMZFormer taoiseach discusses Bougainville\u0026rsquos vote for independence with UN chiefAnger in Beijing at Tory leadership contender\u0026rsquos comments on Hong Kong unrestOnce-dominant party ruled by Nehru-Gandhi dynasty suffered election thrashingAt least 80 killed in region as failing infrastructure forces government to call public holidayResidents urged to leave early \u0026lsquoto protect your lives\u0026rsquo as month of rain to fall in one dayAMP distrust of Australia may cheat citizens of infrastructure if funds flow into Tasi ManeBritain urges China not to use unrest in Hong Kong as a \u0026lsquopretext for oppression\u0026rsquoDemonstrators spray graffiti, smash pictures after breaking into government headquartersGlowing coverage underlines concerns that US president facilitated propaganda coupOfficials investigating whether it was a mechanical failure or driver negligence"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

There is absolutely a perception among students, echoed by teachers, that getting top grades in languages is difficult and is more difficult than other subjects.”Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, says the status quo is \u0026#34unacceptable\u0026#34He said this is not an unreasonable calculation to make, adding that parents also advise their children against languages on this basis. They are making the same sort of calculation: What is going to enable my child to as successful as possible?What will be the best passport to the next stage?Entries for GCSEs in both French and German have dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent, according to figures compiled by the British Council for its annual language trends report. The report, published earlier this week, showed that in 2014, there were 166,167 entries for French GCSE and 60,362 for German but by 2018, this had dropped to 117,046 and 42,296 respectively.Mr Buchanan said that the status quo is “unacceptable”, adding: “Whether its Ofqual or someone else - unless we do something, languages will die. There won’t be students who want to take them, and over time there won’t be enough teachers to teach them”.This summer is the second year that students have taken revamped GCSE exams in modern foreign languages (MFL).The new courses were part of a package of reforms by Michael Gove, the former education secretary, designed to toughen up syllabuses, make courses more linear, and cut down on the number of students getting A*s.Ofqual, the exam regulator, is currently undertaking a review of the reformed GCSE MFL subjects, which is due to conclude this autumn.It said it is “aware of statistical evidence” that suggests that GCSE MFL subjects may be “more severely graded than many others”.However, the watchdog said that this alone is not necessarily enough to “justify a change to grading standards”.An Ofqual spokesperson said that their research so far suggests that the new GCSEs are “functioning well”, but added that it takes concerns about the perceived difficulty of MFL subjects “seriously” and it “continues to look at this issue in detail”.They added: “We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of grading standards in GCSE French, German and Spanish, looking at statistical evidence, contextual data including trends in the numbers taking these subjects and the quality of students’ work, to see if there is compelling case for an adjustment to grading standards in these subjects.”Tory leadership latest news: Head to head debate is Jeremy Hunt\u0026#39s \u0026#39final shot\u0026#39 at beating Boris Johnson, allies claimHow prawns could be the key to fighting poverty and a debilitating tropical diseaseTrafficked prostitute returned by immigration officials to brothel where she was sexually exploitedSir Kim Darroch frozen out of Ivanka Trump meeting as president says US will \u0026#39no longer deal with him\u0026#39Boris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullHPV vaccine for boys raises hope of eradicating cervical cancerFinsbury Park attack: One man shot and another stabbed in North LondonWatch in full: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are quizzed by our writers and readers at  hustings Video shows last moments of Himalayan climbers who were swept away in avalancheIran warns Britain\u0026#39s seizure of oil tanker in Gibraltar \u0026#39will not go unanswered\u0026#39Comment: Increasing life expectancy is having a radical effect on the workplaceIrish border Brexit blueprint \u0026#39lacks credibility\u0026#39 British-Irish chamber of commerce warnsNadiya Hussain: why peel potatoes when you can buy them in a tin?Comment: The NHS waiting list crisis shows a cure is needed for our complex tax systemComment: Revealed: The evidence which shows we need the sugar tax to fight the obesity epidemicTaliban will not attack schools and markets under agreement to cut violenceHong Kong leader Carrie Lam declares extradition bill \u0026#39dead\u0026#39 - but stops short of withdrawing itBillionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein pleads not guilty to sex trafficking chargesDonald Trump \u0026#39will no longer deal\u0026#39 with British ambassador, as he hits out at Theresa May for Brexit \u0026#39mess\u0026#39 Families left to plug £15bn gap in \u0026#39dreadfully broken\u0026#39 dementia systemWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 8 july 2019","story":"One of the eagles catching a fish.

Now Nadiya Hussain is risking the same fate by getting her roast potatoes from a tin.Hussain’s new series, Time To Eat, offers a selection of recipes for time-pressed cooks. Tinned potatoes are on her ingredients list, baked in the oven for 25 minutes.Her recipe involves baking the potatoes in a tray with sundried tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and salt. “They’re the quickest roast potatoes you will ever make,” she said.Hussain also makes a pasta bake using a tin of spaghetti hoops mixed with white fish, cherry tomatoes, chilli, spring onions and broccoli.Nadiya\u0026#39s new series is aimed at people with \u0026#39busy lifestyles and complicated family routines\u0026#39Speaking about the series to Radio Times, the Great British Bake Off winner explained: “There’s nothing wrong with using frozen and canned food. There’s nothing in this series I’m ashamed of. It’s the way I cook.“What’s happened to society is we’ve become really pretentious. But there was a time in my life where I really had to choose between boiling potatoes and paying my gas bill, so I’d buy a can of potatoes.“Why not use cheaper ingredients? If something doesn’t poison us, I think we should eat it.”Asked if she feared accusations of dumbing down, as Delia Smith faced with her How To Cheat series, Hussain replied: “No, because I don’t care. I’m not Delia.“We live in a world where we often get told what we should and shouldn’t do. I don’t think we should worry so much. Think about how much time you save by not boiling those potatoes, and they taste so good - they taste even better when you think about how you haven’t slaved over a hot stove to make them.”Smith made headlines with her series in 2008 when she presented a shepherd’s pie recipe made with Aunt Bessie’s frozen mash, and a moussaka that included tinned minced lamb from M\u0026ampS.Chefs were up in arms. Brian Turner said he refused to believe that Smith ate frozen mash, while Aldo Zilli said that when his wife began preparing the moussaka recipe “I thought she was cooking for the dog”.Tory leadership latest news: Head to head debate is Jeremy Hunt\u0026#39s \u0026#39final shot\u0026#39 at beating Boris Johnson, allies claimHow prawns could be the key to fighting poverty and a debilitating tropical diseaseTrafficked prostitute returned by immigration officials to brothel where she was sexually exploitedSir Kim Darroch frozen out of Ivanka Trump meeting as president says US will \u0026#39no longer deal with him\u0026#39Boris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullHPV vaccine for boys raises hope of eradicating cervical cancerFinsbury Park attack: One man shot and another stabbed in North LondonWatch in full: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are quizzed by our writers and readers at  hustings Video shows last moments of Himalayan climbers who were swept away in avalancheIran warns Britain\u0026#39s seizure of oil tanker in Gibraltar \u0026#39will not go unanswered\u0026#39Comment: Increasing life expectancy is having a radical effect on the workplaceIrish border Brexit blueprint \u0026#39lacks credibility\u0026#39 British-Irish chamber of commerce warnsComment: The NHS waiting list crisis shows a cure is needed for our complex tax systemComment: Revealed: The evidence which shows we need the sugar tax to fight the obesity epidemicTaliban will not attack schools and markets under agreement to cut violenceHong Kong leader Carrie Lam declares extradition bill \u0026#39dead\u0026#39 - but stops short of withdrawing itBillionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein pleads not guilty to sex trafficking chargesDonald Trump \u0026#39will no longer deal\u0026#39 with British ambassador, as he hits out at Theresa May for Brexit \u0026#39mess\u0026#39 Families left to plug £15bn gap in \u0026#39dreadfully broken\u0026#39 dementia systemChildren have never had it so good, Education Secretary insists amid warnings of social media fuelled \u0026#39childhood crisis\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/08/15/07703365.jpg","title":"greece election prime minister kyriakos mitsotakis party new democracy","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsAnalysis: New Democracy win hailed as a defeat of populism and a return-to-normal for Greece – but the reality is more complexClick to followThe IndependentGreece’s new prime minister was sworn in on Monday after the centre-right New Democracy party capitalised on voters’ disillusionment with the radical leftist Syriza party.The victory of Kyriakos Mitsotakis has been hailed by commentators around the world as a defeat of populism and a return-to-normal for Greece. But, in a country that has suffered the worst recession experienced by a developed economy, challenges abound for the new government.“It’s a great result for Mitsotakis,” said Yiannis Mouzakis, co-editor of Greek economics site MacroPolis.“He has a clear parliamentary majority and enough rule over his party to move ahead with more liberal economic ideas he has.”However, Mr Mouzakis warned that the new prime minister will not have an easy ride.Mr Mitsotakis has promised tax cuts, but these rely on convincing Greece’s creditors to lower the country’s fiscal targets which, as Mr Mouzakis cautioned, is “going to be a hard job”.Similarly, the prime minister’s plan to attract more foreign investment is going to be tough when there is still a €30bn gap between current and pre-crisis levels.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Temple Priest Siva Sri Arumugam Paskarakurukkal and Hindu devotees celebrate the Makorcavam temple festival at Germany\u0027s largest Hindu temple in Hamm, GermanyMegan Rapinoe lifts the Women\u0027s World Cup following USA\u0027s victory over The Netherlands at Stade de Lyon in the final held in FranceManneken Pis is dressed in the overall leader\u0027s yellow jersey, before the start of the Tour de France Stage 1Sudanese protesters celebrate in the streets of Khartoum after ruling generals and protest leaders announced they have reached an agreement on the disputed issue of a new governing bodyDemonstrators burn a national flag in front of the White House during a Fourth of July protest Smoke billows and flames propagate across the hillside near houses after the Stromboli volcano erupted in the north of Sicily.

Mr Zelensky with 73,22 percent of the votes beat out the current president Petro Poroshenko, who received 24,45 percent of the votes during the second tour of presidential elections in Ukraine which was held on 21 AprilMr Mitsotakis, whose father Konstantinos was prime minister in the early 1990s, is seen as a moderate centrist. However, his party contains many nationalist elements and is traditionally close with the Orthodox church. It is also blamed by many for the economic mismanagement that led to the country’s crisis. “I don’t see very good news,” said Aris Hatzis, professor of philosophy and law at the University of Athens, who previously told The Independent that one of Mr Mitsotakis’s main challenges will be modernising his party. “I have seen the MPs that conservative voters prefer, and most of them are coming from the old New Democracy that bankrupted the country.”However, he said that the new cabinet is more socially liberal and market-orientated than the overall makeup of the party, adding: “The downside is there are only five women.”Another surprise of the night was that Syriza drew a greater vote share than expected – the party managed 31.53 per cent compared to New Democracy’s 39.85 per cent. Pre-election polling had put them double-digits behind the favourites.“Syriza’s supporters were mobilised, whereas New Democracy supporters were not so active because they thought it was an easy victory,” said Mr Hatzis. It also appeared that Syriza managed to mobilise the youth vote at the last minute.Outgoing prime minister Alexis Tsipras is set to stay on as the party’s leader and Mr Hatzis believe he will return to the fiery, opportunistic tactics he used when in opposition prior to 2015. However, he may have “a thorn in his side” in the form of former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who is re-entering the Greek parliament after his new party Diem25 won 4.44 per cent of the vote.“He will be targeting Syriza’s voters rather than New Democracy’s,” said Mr Hatzis. “He will likely make Tsipras’s life miserable sometimes.”Many are celebrating the fact that neo-Nazi Golden Dawn – previously the third-largest party in parliament – failed to gain any seats. However, observers caution that this is not because far-right ideas have disappeared. The new nationalist Greek Solution party split the vote share and won 10 seats in parliament. It is led by conspiracy theorist Kyriakos Velopoulos, who used to claim to sell handwritten letters from Jesus on his TV show.“He’s not as smart as Varoufakis, but he will probably cause some havoc,” said Mr Hatzis.Mitsotakis is a centrist figure but many members of his party are notAnd despite Mr Mitsotakis’s reputation as a liberal and anti-populist, he appeared to have won far-right voters by taking a hard stance on immigration and exploiting popular dissatisfaction with the Macedonia name deal.He attacked Mr Tsipras for the outcome of the deal, which was supported by the EU and Nato, but later admitted he was unable to change it.“Mitsotakis is a centrist figure but many members of his party are not,” agrees Daphne Halikiopoulou, associate professor of politics at the University of Reading and an expert on the far-right. “It’s not as blatant a populism as Syriza used to be, but there are many populist elements to the party.”Another crucial feature of the election which should not be overlooked is the fact voter turnout was a mere 57.89 per cent – the lowest ever recorded in Greece.“There’s still a lot of disillusionment and the line is very fine,” warned Ms Halikiopoulou. “I think we need to be very careful with all this talk of a return to normality.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, in a country that has suffered the worst recession experienced by a developed economy, challenges abound for the new government.“It’s a great result for Mitsotakis,” said Yiannis Mouzakis, co-editor of Greek economics site MacroPolis.“He has a clear parliamentary majority and enough rule over his party to move ahead with more liberal economic ideas he has.”However, Mr Mouzakis warned that the new prime minister will not have an easy ride.Mr Mitsotakis has promised tax cuts, but these rely on convincing Greece’s creditors to lower the country’s fiscal targets which, as Mr Mouzakis cautioned, is “going to be a hard job”.Similarly, the prime minister’s plan to attract more foreign investment is going to be tough when there is still a €30bn gap between current and pre-crisis levels.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Temple Priest Siva Sri Arumugam Paskarakurukkal and Hindu devotees celebrate the Makorcavam temple festival at Germany\u0027s largest Hindu temple in Hamm, GermanyMegan Rapinoe lifts the Women\u0027s World Cup following USA\u0027s victory over The Netherlands at Stade de Lyon in the final held in FranceManneken Pis is dressed in the overall leader\u0027s yellow jersey, before the start of the Tour de France Stage 1Sudanese protesters celebrate in the streets of Khartoum after ruling generals and protest leaders announced they have reached an agreement on the disputed issue of a new governing bodyDemonstrators burn a national flag in front of the White House during a Fourth of July protest Smoke billows and flames propagate across the hillside near houses after the Stromboli volcano erupted in the north of Sicily.

Mr Zelensky with 73,22 percent of the votes beat out the current president Petro Poroshenko, who received 24,45 percent of the votes during the second tour of presidential elections in Ukraine which was held on 21 AprilMr Mitsotakis, whose father Konstantinos was prime minister in the early 1990s, is seen as a moderate centrist. However, his party contains many nationalist elements and is traditionally close with the Orthodox church. It is also blamed by many for the economic mismanagement that led to the country’s crisis. “I don’t see very good news,” said Aris Hatzis, professor of philosophy and law at the University of Athens, who previously told The Independent that one of Mr Mitsotakis’s main challenges will be modernising his party. “I have seen the MPs that conservative voters prefer, and most of them are coming from the old New Democracy that bankrupted the country.”However, he said that the new cabinet is more socially liberal and market-orientated than the overall makeup of the party, adding: “The downside is there are only five women.”Another surprise of the night was that Syriza drew a greater vote share than expected – the party managed 31.53 per cent compared to New Democracy’s 39.85 per cent. Pre-election polling had put them double-digits behind the favourites.“Syriza’s supporters were mobilised, whereas New Democracy supporters were not so active because they thought it was an easy victory,” said Mr Hatzis. It also appeared that Syriza managed to mobilise the youth vote at the last minute.Outgoing prime minister Alexis Tsipras is set to stay on as the party’s leader and Mr Hatzis believe he will return to the fiery, opportunistic tactics he used when in opposition prior to 2015. However, he may have “a thorn in his side” in the form of former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who is re-entering the Greek parliament after his new party Diem25 won 4.44 per cent of the vote.“He will be targeting Syriza’s voters rather than New Democracy’s,” said Mr Hatzis. “He will likely make Tsipras’s life miserable sometimes.”Many are celebrating the fact that neo-Nazi Golden Dawn – previously the third-largest party in parliament – failed to gain any seats. However, observers caution that this is not because far-right ideas have disappeared. The new nationalist Greek Solution party split the vote share and won 10 seats in parliament. It is led by conspiracy theorist Kyriakos Velopoulos, who used to claim to sell handwritten letters from Jesus on his TV show.“He’s not as smart as Varoufakis, but he will probably cause some havoc,” said Mr Hatzis.Mitsotakis is a centrist figure but many members of his party are notAnd despite Mr Mitsotakis’s reputation as a liberal and anti-populist, he appeared to have won far-right voters by taking a hard stance on immigration and exploiting popular dissatisfaction with the Macedonia name deal.He attacked Mr Tsipras for the outcome of the deal, which was supported by the EU and Nato, but later admitted he was unable to change it.“Mitsotakis is a centrist figure but many members of his party are not,” agrees Daphne Halikiopoulou, associate professor of politics at the University of Reading and an expert on the far-right. “It’s not as blatant a populism as Syriza used to be, but there are many populist elements to the party.”Another crucial feature of the election which should not be overlooked is the fact voter turnout was a mere 57.89 per cent – the lowest ever recorded in Greece.“There’s still a lot of disillusionment and the line is very fine,” warned Ms Halikiopoulou. “I think we need to be very careful with all this talk of a return to normality.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And to honour the result of the EU referendum.If you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that.Sadly I have not been able to do so. I tried three times - I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high.May survived a vote of no confidence in December , but repeated thwarted attempts to pass her Brexit deal left her without authority.May will remain as Prime Minister until a new party leader is announced in the week beginning July ."},{"url":null,"title":"school summer holidays 2019 start end dates","story":"Here are all the important dates you need to know so you can finalise your plans for the long school break.Schools are in their summer term now - it runs from Tuesday, April , until Wednesday, July .These dates will y depending on the school and you are advised to check your schools website.The period includes half term, which was from Monday, May , to Friday, May , .Kids ed to school on Monday, June , for the last few weeks until the summer break.Many children will be leaving school for their summer break around Wednesday, July .The summer break runs from Thursday, July , with pupils ing on Tuesday, September .It is always best to check the Government or school website in your area to make sure you have the correct date.Some areas such as Leicestershire break up earlier on Friday, July .Locations in Scotland break up even earlier with the last day of school on Thursday, July .Most schools publish their term dates on their websites.And councils will usually also provide the details online.This handy website also lists all bank holidays and school holidays in every local authority area for the academic years   and  .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to collateral TOP SECRET, he has been linked to possible attack planning in Kandahar province.Its an example of the type of information the officers would receive before passing it onto the military to take action.The Governments electronic eavesdropping agency have used these field offices across remote military bases in the early days of missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, providing the military with intelligence as they monitored threats like the Taliban.The information would help stop plots to target British convoys and foil physical or digital threats to the UK.And it was these offices that were part of the biggest overseas deployment since the Second World War as they organised listening posts across southern Afghanistan.The work of the GCHQ in Afghanistan was only revealed in  when they flew out more than  tonnes of equipment - equivalent to  shipping containers worth.The staggering amounts of equipment was six times more kit than the agency deployed during Britain’s post- Iraq campaign.Speaking to the Sun Online, a government communications officer – who can only be known as Fi – revealed how they would work up to  hours in the steel container during top secret missions.She said: “We can be up and running with top secret communications as soon as we arrive in dferent locations.“We provide the right intelligence to the military they need to keep them safe.”The huge containers can even be choppered into site thanks to huge Chinooks.And she said the shipping containers were designed to fit in at any base camp or field office, giving no hint as to the vital work going on inside.Body armour: This body armour is ready to be grabbed at any moment, to be worn in military bases during a time of attackDestructive tools: In case the secure base was breached, GCHQ officers were given training as to how to destroy the contents of the shipping container to ensure it did not fall into the wrong handsDiplomatic bag: These plain bags would be used to carry sensitive information around the campEscape hatch: In case of an emergency, officers would be able to scramble through the emergency exit hatchGt vouchers: These tokens are used in camps like Camp Bastian in Afghanistan as a form of changeOn Her Majesty’s Service envelopes: Information would be posted in these envelopesPink discman: The servers would make constant noise, with officers using music to block out the consistent humKeep Calm and Carry on poster: Homely touches helped to make officers feel more comfortable in the foreign surroundingsCup of Noodles: Working such long hours, sugar and food would always be in constant supply in the officesMaps: Part of the work done by GCHQ officers was to ensure the military knew as much as possible about ongoing missions or what was happening in certain areasDiarrhea tablets: According to communications officer Fi, this was one of the facts of le while based overseasFly paper and jungle formula:  In the baking heat of some bases, keeping the pests at bay with insect repellent was importantWater purication tablets: Sometimes supplies could be in short supply, meaning water puritcation tablets were extremely important for workersTemperature gauge: High temperatures in the field are kept in check in the field office, with sensitive computer equipment needing to be kept between  and CFi, who was deployed to Afghanistan three times for stints of five to seven months and Iraq for  weeks, said she had remained determined to do her work throughout.She said: “I think about why we are out there, we are there to support the military.“On the worst days, you think about what you are doing and that gives you quite a bit of motivation to get out of bed. You’re part of the team.”The GCHQ had been established after the First World War, known as the Government Code and Cypher School until .Responsible for breaking the German Enigma codes, its work has continued to see it gather information and secures the UKs own communications.And the work has changed from cold war-era listening posts to include digital surveillance - monitoring increasingly cyber threats posed by countries like Russia, North Korea and China.Most recently, the GCHQ revealed it had played a major part in a cyber campaign against ISIS and its propaganda.But amongst the frantic security work that goes on inside this unassuming box, touches of home are added.A Keep Calm Carry On poster is tacked on the wall, cups of noodles are piled in the corner and a scarf sits draped over the office chair.Tea and biscuits are also at the ready during the long shts and military visits.Fi said: “Earl grey and shortbread was popular – being able to give people tea and biscuits in the very British way was a way to build relationships.”A picture of a bunny rabbit sits attached to one of the servers – with the animal having been gted to one of the soldiers by a local he was teaching English.The pet, dubbed Honey Bunny, then became a camp favourite.It is these stories, and the fascinating work done by GCHQ, that will be marked in the Science Museum’s new exhibition that opens on July .GCHQ, or the Government Code  Cypher Schoolas it was known at the time, was established on  November  as a peacetime cryptanalytic unit made up from staff from the Admiraltys Room  and the War Offices MI.During WWII, GCHQ staff moved to Bletchley Park where they decrypted German messages, most famously by breaking Enigma-encrypted communications, making a signicant contribution to the Allied victory.The organisation moved to Cheltenham in , and then settled into its current building, famously nicknamed the Doughnut in .They now have sites across the country, including Bude, Scarborough, Harrogate, Lincolnshire, and London, and a new facility in Manchester will be opened later this year.Jeremy Fleming, Director GCHQ said: “This unique collaboration between GCHQ and the Science Museum is a great way to mark our Centenary and give visitors previously-unseen insights into how GCHQ has helped protect the UK over the past  years.“For the first time the public will be given a glimpse into our secret history of amazing intelligence, world-leading innovation, and most of all brilliant people.“And - as the threats to the UK become more erse and more complex - it’s a chance to encourage the next generation of recruits. Because at GCHQ we believe that with the right mix of minds anything is possible.”Hannah Daley, the Science Museum’s exhibition project manager, said she was thrilled that more than one hundred items would be on display for members of the public.She said: “It’s an insight into a secret world we don’t normally get to see, and how they support the military.“There are powerful stories about how they do that work, and le their le in secret.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt pm vision britain","story":"He would use his negotiating experience to extract a better Brexit deal and take us out of the EU.

Perhaps they feel aggrieved by the bad publicity and have decided to pull up the drawbridge to keep us all out today.It doesn’t work like that.Diana, who knew all about public perception and how to deal with the media, would have advised them to counteract the criticism by making sure that Archie’s christening was an event the whole country could enjoy.There would have been no question of the names of godparents being kept secret, or photos of such a big occasion only being released on Harry and Meghan’s carefully controlled Instagram account.Diana would have known that images of a cute baby and his doting parents, with guests all done up to the nines, would take the heat off the negative stories surrounding the Frogmore building work.I’m sure Meghan has been bruised by some of the, frankly, racist and utterly vile comments on social media, as well as the upsetting and ongoing feud with her family — apart from her mum, Doria.Not even Diana would have been able to silence those hideous trolls, but her wise counsel would have stopped the Markle clan from being a thorn in Meghan’s side.Even before the engagement announcement, Diana would have flown over to the USA and entranced Thomas Markle.I have no doubt Diana would have given him a masterclass in dealing with the media.There would have been no clumsy staged paparazzi shots and Thomas Markle would have proudly walked his daughter down the aisle.Diana, would have been on hand with advice about the announcement of baby Archie’s arrival, which was all a bit messy.She would have been a staunch ally to Meghan and helped her navigate the choppy waters of royal protocol, and been a terric sounding board for any worries the new mum might encounter.Diana would have been a cheerleader for Harry and Meghan’s plans to make a dference both here and in Africa and supported their plans to spend half the year in Botswana with baby Archie, albeit with assurances that “Granny Di” could pop over for regular visits.I understand Harry and Meghan want to protect their little boy and allow him to grow up leading as “normal” a le as possible, but they really can’t have it both ways.Either they are private citizens and pay for their own loft extension, or they are royals and have to share the big events in their lives with the rest of the world. Diana would have helped them achieve that balance.It’s a crying shame she isn’t here, but I truly hope Harry and Meghan have a joyful time today and maybe even change their minds and give us all a peek at the celebrations.FIFTY years ago, Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon and the world was in awe.As a ten-year-old watching this “giant leap for mankind” I genuinely believed that we had taken the first small step into the unknown and were boldly going “where no one had gone before”.I did a primary school project on the first manned voyage to Mars, which we reckoned would take place in  –  nothing seemed impossible.In the years before the Moon landing, we watched Star Trek and thought we’d be living that TV series for real.There was to have been a lunar base, and from there we would explore the solar system and eventually the rest of the universe.Of course none of this came to pass, except in our imaginations and sci-fi films.Scientists had the curiosity and the imagination but, sadly, the general public lost interest.After the space shuttle disasters in  and  that killed  crew members, politicians got cold feet and the manned missions were shelved.This loss of le was tragic but, ever since we started exploring space, astronauts have always paid the ultimate price.Even the Apollo  Moon landing came close to disaster.This week sees the release of Armstrong, an astonishing documentary about the first man on the Moon.Watching the footage, you will gain a new-found respect for this rare breed of human beings.Hopefully it will ignite a new passion among this current generation to once again travel into space.If we don’t seek out “new le and new civilisations”, then what are we actually here for THE biggest kid of all in the le of Coleen Rooney would appear to be her husband.She’s ed home with her four boys and left Wayne in the US with a list of strict instructions most mums would leave for their stroppy teenage sons.Wayne has been warned that there is to be no boozing, no wild parties and he has to phone Coleen every day to check in with her so she can be reassured he really is behaving himself.No wonder the poor lass has to have so many holidays.Looking after FIVE boisterous boys must be utterly exhausting.I AM more than a little bit in love with Suranne Jones as “Gentleman Jack”.This cracking drama based on the real-le th century lesbian Anne Lister is witty, wicked and, at times, impossibly sad.Anne was a bold pioneer trying to find her place in le.At a time when women were kept firmly in their place and either treated like imbeciles or fragile pieces of bone china, she was a sharp businesswoman who owned her own land and took no s**t.When it came to matters of the heart, however, Anne was achingly vulnerable and badly let down by the women she loved.It’s the last episode tomorrow but,you have missed out, you can catch up on BBC iPlayer and a second series has already been commissioned.CAROL Vorderman has the sort of figure that would make Jessica Rabbit turn pea green with envy – proper gorgeous, voluptuous curves.She told me it’s all down to doing thousands of squats, walking for miles in the countryside and the side-effects of the menopause.Under that regime, most of us would end up with rock-hard flat buttocks, sore feet and horric night sweats.GAIL Porter famously once had her derrière beamed on to the Houses of Parliament.It actually made a refreshing change to see a backside on the outside of the building, instead of the usual arses who inhabit the interior.Back then, Gail was at the height of her fame as a TV presenter and lads’ mag favourite.It looked as though she was living the dream, but the poor girl was suffering horribly inside.She’s had well documented mental health issues including being diagnosed as bipolar, and suffering with anorexia and anxiety.At one point, in deep despair, she even tried to take her own le.Possibly due to all the stress, Gail’s hair fell out and never grew back.It’s not been an easy road, but I am delighted this irrepressible and beautul woman has bounced back.She’s now in a good place and keen to help others who have been through similar experiences.Gail has teamed up with The Samaritans, an organisation that has helped her in the past, to ask us all to take part in a marathon.The good news is you can take the whole of July to reach  miles.That’s under a mile a day and you can run, jog or walk.Build up your miles in your nearest park, going to work on foot or just out for a stroll.For more information on the Samarathon, see Samaritans.org. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Create a separate veterans department for the first time to coordinate their needs across Whitehall, run by a minister who attends Cabinet,. Enshrine the Military Covenant into law to allow vets and bereaved families a way to hold the Government to accountthey suffer disadvantage,. Pass new legislation to end unfair and repeated investigations into historical allegations before the next General Election.The call for the two wannabe Prime Ministers to sign up to the pledge is also backed by ex-Army senior Tory MPs from each of the two men’s campaigns.Writing in The Sun today, ex-Royal Artillery officer Johnny Mercer – a prominent Boris backer – brands it Britain’s “GI Bill moment”, named after the time when America finally decided to do good by its Vietnam War veterans.Mr Mercer adds: “It would be political madness for Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to fail to sign up.”Hunt supporter Richard Benyon, a former Green Jackets officer, said: “The change of leadership is a very important opportunity for us to reboot what Government should be doing to protect our veterans.“The Veterans Pledge is the right way forward.”Previous Governments have, to their credit, taken steps in the right direction.But their activities have often been piecemeal or lacking in an overall direction.Giving the money from interest rate-rigging fines to Armed Forces charities is a good example.A promise of nearly £bn, but a promise that hasn’t been delivered as fully as it should have been, with Ministers even dipping into the pot to cover shortfalls in their own budgets.We need a sea change — and that’s why we’ve partnered with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress to demand a Cabinet Minister takes the reins on this vital issue under a Johnson or Hunt Government.And that Minister mustn’t just be there to turn up for photo ops at far-flung bases.They must drive through a firmer commitment to the Military Covenant and, vitally, work with the Attorney General to end the persecution of veterans from former conflicts.Everybody who has served has put their le on the line for us — and their families have sacriced plenty, too.Time to deliver.Help for Heroes CEO Melanie Waters said: “We have supported over , wounded military personnel and their families so far and the need is growing, which is why we are calling on the leadership candidates to sign up to the Veterans’ Pledge.“Many wounded veterans feel let down by the system and we know more needs to be done by the Government to ensure our heroes get the fair deal they deserve.”Eighteen years of almost constant war fighting since the   terror attacks in areas such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have taken a huge toll on troops.Last year alone, there were , medical discharges from the UK’s Armed Forces,  of them for mental health conditions.It emerged yesterday that almost  vets a day are now seeking help for mental health issues.A recent King’s College London study revealed , former servicemen and women are still suffering from their physical or mental injuries from the modern wars of the past  years.The pledge’s unveiling comes as outgoing PM Theresa May today makes the final speech of her Premiership to the forces to thank them.On a visit to Permanent Joint headquarters, Mrs May will say: “There is no greater responsibility as Prime Minister than ensuring the safety and security of our people.“And doing so is not something any Prime Minister can achieve without you.“You are not just a part of British le – you are the guarantors of British le. The foundation of our freedom. The protectors of our democracy. And for that, we owe you a debt of gratitude.”I have no ties to any particular charity, no agenda in this field — except a point-blank refusal to accept poor care of vet­erans and their families.Make no mistake — Help for Heroes, the Legion, The Soldiers Charity, SSAFA and more deliver world-class services.But there is no doubt they need help. The pathways are still too unclear.Not all charities spend their money in the most effective way.Access to service records remains a nightmare.The Veteran’s transition from military service to a civilian GP is still entirely postcode-driven.The Military Covenant is not applied equally. If a local authority does not believe in it, then it does not apply.Similarly, hundreds dragged through the historical allegations process have no clear support.The new PM must seize the nettle and create a small, dedicated unit in the Cabinet Office.This is our GI Bill moment, a chance to emulate the US treatment of its veterans.Our Government has not led in this sector for too long. In this change of administration, I want a change of attitude. Enough of the warm words and intentions.The Sun and our major care-givers today demand a tangible commitment to do by our veterans our duty we should have done some years ago.It would be political madness for Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to fail to sign up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I t has to be done in a way that supports the Good Friday Agreement, but we have got to find a way of ending these vexatious claims.”And Ms Mordaunt said in the Commons: “Can I welcome The Sun’s campaign today.“We will shortly be bringing forward the first stage to legislate on closing down litigation against our Armed Forces for historic allegations.”She also announced a major review into how the Ministry of Defence treats veterans.The Sun is also calling for an Office of Veterans’ Affairs within the Cabinet Office, with a Cabinet-level Minister.Tory MP and ex-officer Johnny Mercer said: “It’s our GI Bill moment, a chance to emulate the US treatment of its veterans.“The Sun and our major care-givers today demand a tangible commitment to do by our veterans our duty we should have done some years ago.”Britain has , veterans still suffering mental or physical injuries from wars of the last  years, recent research found.Here we speak to veterans and their families supporting The Sun’s campaign . . .We are convinced that real change will only happen with a Cabinet Minister drawing together the whole of the Government’s efforts, andcharities are given the support they need.We cannot fail those who never failed us.FORMER Royal Green Jacket Gary Driscoll thought he had emerged from his tour of Northern Ireland relatively unscathed – until he developed post-traumatic stress disorder,  years after he left the Army.The former colour sergeant then had to rely on the support of a charity to help him overcome his problems.Londoner Gary, now , says: “On the first patrol in Belfast as part of a nine-month tour I was shot at.“The rounds missed me by inches, hitting the wall behind me. But this was not a battlefield, it was a housing estate. A lot of friends were killed.“When you are on tour in a conflict zone such as Northern Ireland you have to remain switched on the whole time. When you leave the Army there is no off switch.“There is supposed to be a covenant for the Armed Forces whereby the Government provides the support we need.“But lots of soldiers get into a vicious circle due to mental health issues because they don’t receive help.“When you were out on patrol the last thing you’d admit to is being scared, so soldiers don’t always ask for support. We need to make sure the authorities are looking for signs early on.“In many ways I am lucky, because I have my own house, I’m happily married, I have a day job running a post room and a weekend job as a singer.“But  years after I left the Army I started to get symptoms of PTSD, which my we recognised before I noticed anything.“I suffered nightmares, started drinking to excess and started to do things which were out of character, such as challenging people on the Underground and going to dodgy pubs on my own, looking for danger.“I think it was Northern Ireland coming to the front of my head. Eventually I agreed to go and ask for support, and the we found a charity called Combat Stress who were willing to assess me.“I was lucky I caught it early and I haven’t needed to go back for any therapy for five years.“But I know many veterans are not so fortunate to have received that kind of treatment.”SAS hero Bob Curry stormed the Iranian Embassy to rescue hostages – but last year he was refused a council house when he was made homeless.The -year-old, who helped to save  lives during the London siege in , had lost his house in Hereford after his business collapsed and he split up with his partner.He says: “When I lost my home the council wouldn’t even put me on the housing list – they told me I didn’t qualy. They were so arrogant.“In a private meeting one housing officer asked me, ‘Have you been out of the military five years ’ and when I said ‘Yes’, he threw his pencil across the table, held his arms and huffed.“In Hereford, because I had been out of the military for five years, I was no longer considered to be a veteran.“I said to them, ‘All of those men and women standing at the Cenotaph on the th of the th aren’t veterans any more ’ and he replied, ‘Not in Hereford, they’re not’.“Out of the homeless population in Britain,  per cent are veterans, and I believe there should be a dedicated officer for the ex-military in every council. I definitely back The Sun’s Veterans’ Pledge, because promises have not been kept.“Politicians talk about a covenant but when you start dealing with bureaucracy, no one cares. You have got to look after these people, because they looked after the country.“Lots of veterans on the street don’t have any paperwork. I had to prove everything three times – three lots of proof.“I was in a halfway house for a couple of nights, which was hell. I kipped on my daughter’s couch for a month and then the SAS Regimental Association paid for me to be put up in a BB.“Butit hadn’t been for them and The Sun, who campaigned to get me the bungalow I’m living in now, nothing would have happened.“I was  years in the forces. I did Northern Ireland, I did the Iranian Embassy and the Falklands. We need to do more for squaddies when they leave the service.“It starts with making sure they have a roof over their head and they have someone to talk to with the transition into civilian le.“It’s no wonder so many veterans wander off to the woods with a bit of rope.”LANCE Bombardier Ben Parkinson MBE is Britain’s most seriously injured veteran.The former paratrooper, who is now , lost both legs and suffered a broken pelvis and spine, as well as brain damage, when his military Land Rover hit an anti-tank mine in Afghanistan  years ago.He was initially awarded just £, by the MoD under its statutory compensation scheme for service personnel injured in combat.After a campaign it was increased to £,, which his family used to buy him a bungalow and fit it out with specialist equipment.Ben’s full-time carers, his mum Diane Dernie and stepdad Andrew, have valiantly battled for years to make sure his care is properly funded.Diane says: “I back The Sun’s campaign because we need to treat our veterans like heroes, just like the Americans do.The next Prime Minister needs to make this a top priority. We thought the Military Covenant had been enshrined in law, but it turns out it depends how your local area interprets it.“We also thought that veterans would get preferential referencing for medical services and things like that, but it also turns out that’s not the case. All that’s agreed is that they shouldn’t be disadvantaged.“Well, of course they shouldn’t be disadvantaged, there shouldn’t be any question of that. They should be advantaged. It’s one step forward and two back.”Diane, , adds: “The lawyers who launch witch-hunt investigations against veterans are making money out of other people’s heroism and service to their country. That’s unspeakable.“Ben left the Army this year. The bill for his rehabilitation is about £, a year and he gets £, towards that. That figure is under review but we consider ourselves lucky to have got that.“We had to threaten legal action to get it. Ben has a deep love of the Army and thinks everyone must have his best interests at heart.“Behind the scenes we’ve been fighting the MoD and it’s nearly finished me. We sold a property where we were going to retire to, to take legal action.“The funding is nowhere near enough. It’s a starting point and it gives us a chance to let Ben carry on. Ben’s happy when he’s busy but it takes a hell of a lot of support to make sure he has a le worth living.”But too often, this just isn’t the case.We hear from those we support about unacceptable waiting times for treatment, health services that don’t properly understand their needs and the sometimes devastating impacts on their wellbeing of leaving the military as a result of injury or illness.Most recently, we have been calling for veterans with complex rehabilitation needs to be given better access to the MoD’s state-of- the-art rehabilitation centre, Stanford Hall.An Office of Veterans’ Affairs would ensure all government departments are issuing policies which recognise their responsibility to those who have served, while having a Cabinet-level Minister would ensure the needs of our veterans are heard at the highest level.While the principles of the Armed Forces Covenant were enshrined in law in , there are currently no consequencesthe Covenant is not properly applied.We believe this needs to change, to properly deliver on the promise that no inidual should be disadvantaged as a result of their service in the Armed Forces.Help for Heroes has supported more than , wounded personnel and their families to date, but we know more can be done for them – which is why we believe it is vital for the Tory leadership contenders to be signed up to the Veterans’ Pledge and put the needs of wounded heroes back on the agenda.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I had no idea how sneeringly “modern feudal” the whole circus was about to become.What a dismal little VIP gathering Archie’s christening has turned out to be. A PR disaster.Harry and Meghan insisted on conducting the whole thing in secret, refusing even to reveal who his godparents were.I don’t even care who they are —they are Robbie Williams or that plastic Canadian friend of Meghan’s who looks like a Love Island reject, I’d rather not know.But why make such a snitty point of it unless he’s trolling the very people who admire him It seems so unjoyful — the opposite of what a christening is meant to be.I know what his arguments are. He wants a “normal” le for Archie. He hates the Press and the paparazzi.But the truth is the royals get a huge amount of privacy. They have far more privacy than the average citizen.They are not snapped while picking their noses at a newsagent. They are not filmed going on holiday. No one knows where they go on holiday or even where they are when they are not performing their duties.No one sells stories on their private lives or punts pictures. No one takes pictures or follows them at all, because no newspaper would carry the images.Eventhey are spotted by someone, they have huge security teams, paid for by us, to keep us at bay.The royals do not want privacy, they want a private le in public, and no one has the right to that.In spite of this, Harry appears to have gone what I would describe as the full Hugh Grant. Last week it turned out that the actor has become so obsessed with the idea that the paps were following him he confronted an Italian official who was innocently filming rubbish dumped in the street.Everywhere Harry looks, he sees people who want to take advantage of him, which is not true and leads to this sad irascibility in which he forgets what is kind and decent —  and who is paying the bill.What has become of him  If you scan Meghan and Harry’s Instagram feed, you will see how distant the “people’s prince” has turned out. There is no shortage of cloying information on how much he “cares” about alpacas and Mothering Sunday and advancing his sanctimonious “monthly social awareness approach” on mental health or climate change. But it is extra-ordinary how detached from reality the whole thing feels — it is a syrupy, fantasist’s medley of posturing sub-Beyoncean baloney about animals in “gap yah” locations.But does he really care about any of this stuff It is almost ashe has picked a selection of vague, non-committal subjects specically engineered to give no idea what he is thinking, like Leonardo DiCaprio.The overall effect is truly insincere.While it is clear Harry loves the royal tradition of virtue-signalling, it is obvious he does not enjoy being a royal at all. In fact, he dislikes being royal so much, he has waved through this shell of a person called “Prince Harry” operated by an American marketing droid who writes about “sharing” Harry’s “environmental POV”.There are half a million likes for a snap of the prince looking bored.Meghan has similarly vanished.If she had her way, it would not even be a christening, but a naming ceremony with fire pit curators and celebrity mixologists and D-list actresses as earth parents .She is so embarrassing I wonderedit was the godparents who had actually begged for privacy — you can just imagine Beyonce weighing up whether a second-tier royal christening was cool enough for her to openly acknowledge it.And so we have it: A royal christening in a building we paid for, conducted by a bishop whose salary we help foot, featuring royals whose lives we bankroll, in clothes we have paid for, sitting on seats we bought, waited on by staff we fund, with celebs who are not even sure they want to put their name to it.And they think they can say, “Oh, we’re not telling you anything about it” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Private renting is unaffordable for working families on low wages in two-thirds of the country, a new study suggests. The findings indicated that, excluding housing benefit, there are  council areas where local families earning a low wage would be forced to spend more than % of their salary on rent. In  of these areas this rises to more than %. Shelter mapped the hotspots where private renting is the least affordable, Kensington and Cha in London topping the list with the average rent in the borough equivalent to % of a low earning familyaposs take-home pay, followed by Westminster at % and Camden where rents swallow % of pay. Shelter said that in stark contrast to private renting, social rents were found to be affordable for working families on low wages in % of the country. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: Families in lower-paid jobs are having their bank balances bled dry by expensive private rents across huge swathes of the country. The steep decline in social housing has left a growing number of families caught in a debilitating aposrent-trapapos.

It makes no sense to continue haemorrhaging billions of pounds in housing benefit to private landlords, when the Government could support families by investing in a sustainable, long-term solution to the housing emergency instead.

Tory ministers are poised to unveil the bombshell target in a Green Paper outlining new incentives to kick the habit. Tobacco giants could face a levy to pay for the public health costs of helping people quit or switch to e-cigarettes. The same or a similar levy could also fund the cost of a Trading Standards crackdown on black market goods. Meanwhile, leaflets giving advice on how to quit could have to be inserted into every cigarette packet. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to unveil the  target next week, according to the Daily Mail. But the plans are only drafts and could be derailed , as expected, Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister on July .  The Tory leadership hopeful has already vowed to halt all new sin taxes - and his campaignaposs links to the tobacco industry have come under heavy scrutiny. Promising a review of existing apossin taxesapos Mr Johnson said: “Rather than just taxing people more, we should look at how effective the so-called sin taxes really are, andthey actually change behaviour.” Itaposs understood that, as one option, officials are looking at plans for a levy that were proposed last year by Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron.    The backbencher called for a tobacco transition fund that would work like the sugar tax - forcing both customers and the industry to change behaviour. Sir Kevin claimed the fund could raise £billion over a decade, paid by tobacco firms according to market share, to pay for public health aposstop smokingapos services.    Smoking remains the UKaposs biggest preventable cause of cancer, despite rates of Britons lighting up halving in the the last  years. The gains in tobacco control have been hard-won, and thereaposs still much to do, the leaked plans say. For the % of adults who are not yet smoke-free, smoking is the leading cause of ill-health and early death, and a major cause of inequalities. Thataposs why the Government wants to finish the job. But Simon Clark, director of smokersapos group Forest, said people have the right to light up without being harassed to quit. Itaposs not up to government to dictate peopleaposs lestyle, he said. Mr Hancock launched his vision for prevention in November , which he said at the time would aim to add five years to the healthy le expectancy of UK residents. The unveiling of a subsequent Green Paper containing details of the Governmentaposs strategy has been repeatedly delayed but it will reportedly take place next week. There are now . million fewer adult smokers in England than seven years ago, figures show. New figures analysed by NHS Digital show . million people smoked cigarettes in  , down from . million in  .

Carter Cooksonaposs parents said they felt like they had been hit by a bus for a second time after an inquest into his tragic death. Three-week-old Carteraposs plight went public earlier this year when the tiny boy was born into a race against time for a new heart.But a suitable organ was never found and Carter, from South Shields, was just  days old when he died at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle on January , reports Chronicle Live .   Now an inquest has heard that after extensive tests and a post-mortem examination, the cause of the severe damage to his heart remains a mystery. Coroner Karen Dilks said Carter had suffered a sudden catastrophic event that caused damage to his heart around the time of his birth. But the underlying cause of it may never be known. It was a second tragedy for his parents Sarah and Chris Cookson, who lost their first son, Charlie, when he was just two years old.    The inquest at Newcastle Coroneraposs Court heard that when Carter was born by emergency c-section, there were no concerns other than his small size and transverse lie - when the baby is in a sideways position. The hearing was told he was initially well after delivery, but after three hours he was noted to have a low temperature, and at  hours, was noted to have a low heart rate and be struggling with breathing. Paediatric intensive care consultant Yamuna Thiru said Carter was transferred to the Freeman on December , where he was put on an Ecmo machine to pump blood around his body. Dr Thiru said Carteraposs heartnever recovered, and medics soon realised his only hope was to get a donor heart.    Carter was relying on the Ecmo machine to pump blood around his body, but when it needed changing again because of clots his weak body gave out. Unfortunately a donor heart didnapost become available in the last  hours before the disconnection of the Ecmo machine, Dr Thiru said. She added that none of the hospitalaposs tests were able to establish why Carteraposs heart was so badly damaged. Pathologist Dr Fraser Charlton said: An event had occurred around the time of birth that caused a large amount of the heart to die, probably very suddenly. He told the hearing that the damage was so extensive, there was nothing  that could have been done to treat Charlie, unless he had had a transplant.    Ms Dilks said: The sequence of events that led to Carteraposs death were that he had a sudden catastrophic event that led to severe damage to his heart. It was that, in combination with some complications of Ecmo which actually prolonged his le on one hand, but contributed to it on the other as the reason he died when he did. There is no other available conclusion than that it was a naturally occurring event. It must be so dficult from your perspective, the unanswered questions. Following the inquest, Carteraposs dad Chris said: Itaposs like weaposve been hit by a bus for a second time.

No sit down, talk, do whatever the f*** you want - just wind your necks in. In response to the video, bus company Saffordaposs say that badly-behaved kids drove the driver to it, that the bus never moved, and that the kids were posing a safety risk by jumping around the vehicle.    The incident happened on the bus back to Potten from Cambourne Village College, in Cambourne  on July . According to parents whose children were on the bus, the driver slammed on the brakes sending kids aposflyingapos. The driver then reportedly flung open his cab door and stormed down the central aisle before shouting and swearing at the children, most of whom were aged between  and . However, the driver had allegedly forgotten to apply the handbrake and as the bus was stopped on a hill, the vehicle began to coast down the road with no one at the wheel. Parents then say the driver dashed back to the front of the bus and, after struggling with the cab door, managed to stop the vehicle. They say it moved around  feet. But this wasnapost the end. Parents say the driver then went back into the central aisle and let out another tirade of abuse at the busapos occupants, which is shown in the video above. Parents, who have to pay around £ a year for their kids to use the bus, said that aposkids will be kidsapos but added that their children didnapost see anyone behaving too badly.    A spokeswoman for the company said that it was the behaviour of kids on that bus that made their driver stop.

She also told Cambridgeshire Live that the company had complained to the school and were looking into getting an escort on the bus to accompany the driver and deal with the children. She added that recently a driver had previously had a metal object thrown at him and this incident was just one of a number of problems their drivers had with this particular bus route. Cambourne Village College say they are aware of the incident, and that a number of its students have been reprimanded because of the behavior on the bus that day. They also said that the school did not condone the actions of the driver, calling him unprofessional. They added that after talking to the bus company that driver would not be working that bus route again.

Alcoholic Victoria Parry, , had been told by a female judge at a previous hearing that,she had been a man, it would have been straight down the stairs to prison. Instead, she was handed a suspended sentence and slapped with a driving ban today by the same judge. A court heard she was dragged from the flaming wreck by other drivers on the A near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, at around .pm on May , . A breathalsyer test showed she had  micrograms of alcohol per ml of breath - almost three times the legal limit of mcg.    Parry, of Stratford-upon-Avon, was handed an -month suspended sentence, and was banned from driving for  months in the sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court. Judge Sarah Buckingham - who sentenced her - previously sparked outrage when she had gave her a second chance on account of her gender. She told the court during the previous appearance: If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol. But this offence was committed in May  and she has not been in trouble since.  She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic. When Parry was arrested she took a breath test at the police station almost two hours later and was still well over the legal limit. Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said: Her driving was such that she caught the rear bumper of a van, and she next hit the wing mirror of a Vauxhall Insignia, and then the side of a BMW very heavily. She hit it with such force that the BMWaposs rear wheel was knocked off and the car was written off. It caused her Fiat to spin in the road and go down the embankment into a wooded area where it caught fire. The court heard Parry had been banned from driving for three years in July  for her second excess alcohol offence.

The DraigCon event at The Printworks in Manchester had high expectations after a successful event last year. Hundreds of wizarding fans donned capes and hats to indulge their passion for JK Rowling’s world, reports the Manchester Evening News. Fans flocked to buy tickets for this yearaposs event, which promised to aposbe even bigger and betterapos. Organisers promised aposa Magical Market, wild and fantastical animals, plus some QA sessions with the Harry Potter actorsapos, autograph signings and more.   However the eventaposs Facebook page has been swamped with complaints from people who say it was aposnot at all what was advertisedapos.They said nobody was checking tickets at the entrances to The Printworks, so members of the public were allowed in without paying. They said the street itself was aposliterally a large market selling crap you can buy for half the price off the internetapos and despite paying upwards of £ for a ticket, you were being charged £ to hold an owl or a snake, and up to £ to get signatures from some of the actors. Lorna Bremner spent £ on two VIP tickets for her and her child and said she was aposabsolutely fumingapos. Loads of people hadnapost even bought tickets and were getting the free signatures, she said. Queue jumping was a joke as the queues were bigger in the VIP section anyway and didnapost amount to anything dferent to the standard tickets.  I spent an extra  quid just on getting pictures taken with an owl and a snake, which I thought would have been free and the wands, which were £  each. The potions class was overcrowded and we couldnapost hear the speaker so had to leave - plus the cosplay section was poor and they talked about cosplay in general, not Harry Potter themed. As a single mum who bought this as a birthday treat Iaposm highly disappointed. Louise Frankland said: Absolutely appalled by today. Seven tickets bought at £ each to see it open to general public without tickets, overcrowded, and certainly not as advertised. The children are so disappointed today and I am £ down. What a joke! I will be formally complaining. Allan Fouracre, who went there with his girlfriend and another couple, agreed, saying it was a aposwaste of moneyapos.    I wouldnapost , very poorly managed and cheaply done, he said. Merchandise stalls were full of cheap funko pops and other TV film series which had no association with Harry Potter. What we were entitled to as a ticket holder was boring and poor also very easily accessible to the general public who hadnapost paid for that experience. Staff were rude and had no idea were things where and what you were entitled to. He said: The general vibe was very unhappy yesterday. Lots of people were frustrated. The actors who appeared at the event included Chris Rankin , James Payton , Josh Herdman , Scarlett Byrneand more.    But visitors were unhappy with what was included in the ticket price. Jen Whittaker called it an aposabsolute waste of moneyapos and said she had aposthree very disappointed little boysapos. You had to pay extra for everything, she said. From £ to wear a sorting hat, to £ to hold and owl and the merchandise was overpriced and some not even Harry Potter related. Very poor. These were birthday presents for two of the boys and they were bored and disappointed. But not everyone was critical of the event. Kaye Houston travelled there from Lytham St Annes with her nine-year-old son Finneus and said they had a great time.  Brilliant day had by me and my son, she said. We enjoyed the potion making class, seeing the stalls, getting a few autographs and just the general buzz of it. Any stewards or staff we needed to speak to were really helpful in answering queries and everyone was very polite and nice. Thank you, youaposve really made my sonaposs year with this.  And Kerri Jones said: My second time at Draigcon and was not disappointed. We had an amazing weekend. Loved meeting all the actors actress they were all very friendly and happy to have a bit of a chat well they where doing the signings. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Everything was easy to find after studying the programme a little. Greg Dravenwas such a lovely bloke we got to sit down with him and had a lovely chat and find a bit more about him, his work and how he became an actor. Well done for another great event looking forward to the next one. A spokesperson for DraigCon said thousands of fans had visited The Printworks over the weekend and aposexperienced a multitude of magical attractions and experiencesapos.  They added: Weaposve had lots of fantastic feedback from people who attended the two day event and weaposre proud to be able to offer one of the lowest entry prices of any convention in the UK. We aim to deliver value for money to all of our ticket holders - this includes free autographsand access to many attractions. We are aware of some negative comments from a number of customers posted on social media today and we will be looking into these issues.

Property landlord John Batrim recoils in horror as he lays bare the appalling state of the squalid Blackpool BB. Used needles and cigarette butts litter the dilapidated hotel which was forced to close down two years ago. The stomach-churning scenes will be shown in a new episode of Channel  series Nightmare Tenants, Slum Landlords tonight. In one horrying moment, Mr. Batrim notices that the illegal tenants had even used poo-smeared curtains as toilet roll.  “That’s just awful – covered in s**t and it looks like they’ve been using an old curtain to wipe their a**es on. The mind boggles,” says John. It’s not often I smell things like that.” John notices that the squatters had likely entered the property through the back door and then used its rooms as a place to shoot up.    In one scene, John encounters squatters who are told to leave - and they agree to depart without incident. John had been inspecting the property with a view to buying it and letting the rooms out as single bedsits. The bed and breakfast had once been a thriving business, due in part to its close proximity to Blackpool Pier.    But it closed down two years ago as its owners decided what to do with it and was subsequently seized by the squatters who used it as as drugs den. The episode lays bare the anti-social issues that plague the once-booming seaside resort. “Yes, there is an issue with drugs in Blackpool. You have to be vigilant when there are sharps lying around that could harm my colleague or I,” says John.

For while Savile’s vile criminal activities were not uncovered by the film-maker, the nasty views of the Westboro Baptist Church were there for all to see – often emblazoned on placards. The ultra-right, gay-bashing, Jew-hating congregation picketed funerals of US servicemen with banners saying “Thank God for dead soldiers” in protest at the lting of the ban on gay troops. Louis has now ed to the church to make another documentary. It turns out one of the newest members is not only British but was inspired to join by the original films.    “I saw myself as single for le until I watched your documentary and the Jeremy Kyle show about the church and I was very impressed with the Bible verses,” smirks misfit Simon Holroyd, a former postal worker from Bradford now reborn as religious fanatic Matthias. It was King James Bible verses about how women should obey men and submit to their husbands which prompted the disaffected young man to travel , miles to the close-knit Phelps family’s compound in the American Midwest. As Louis’s first documentary on the church in  and the second in  showed, at the centre of this holy hatred in Topeka, Kansas, was the firebrand founder Pastor Fred “Gramps” Phelps and his extended family. Phelps died five years ago but sadly the church still thrives. Having found his spiritual home among the cult’s  or so members, the new convert from Britain was swtly married to Gramps’ granddaughter Jael Phelps.    After defections by some of the young women rocked the family, marrying off those left to the few troubled souls who joined from the outside world was the most expedient way of making their escape virtually impossible. Brother Matthias and Jael have had three children since their wedding in . Deeply indoctrinated Jael says: “He was humble and modest and I felt that we could serve the Lord together.” Explaining the church’s rules for married couples, she adds: “The man dictates what the law in the home is and the we carries that out.” Unsurprisingly born-again hate-monger Brother Matthias didn’t fit in well in Britain and as a result is not a big fan of his home country. He says: “God hates the UK.” Taking a break from holding placards that spew bile, he claims Britain is doomed. He adds: “Things don’t look good for people in the UK. People hate each other. It’s a ided society between the  religion of Muslims and everyone .”    The brainwashed Brit, who was raised by his dad after losing his mum to cancer when he was , is no longer in contact with family back home. He says: “He’s not leading me down that path to hell any more.” His dad will be in good company, because it appears no one is exempt from the punishment of perishing with Satan unless they repent. Senior elder and social media guru Steve Drain says: “When someone dies of cancer, we call it a God-smack.” In the new BBC documentary called Surviving America’s Most Hated Family, Louis discovers the congregation has moved with the times. As well as the placard-waving, the Church is also spreading its poison using the power of social media. Nine days ago the religious zealots tweeted using the hashtags #filth, #shame and #repent to condemn the Pride march in New York. Media savvy elder Drain is the marketing brains behind the placards, videos and now cute dog memes on the internet. It is all aimed at pushing their vile homophobic and anti-Semitic philosophy around the world. Even British recruit Brother Matthias has joined the online ministry of hate, making films denouncing the UK for its decadent culture and attacking gay celebrities such as Sir Elton John.Using his Twitter account to add even more fuel to the fire, he has also added Theresa May , the Labour Party and the entire European Union to the seemingly endless list of sinners facing eternal hell and damnation.  The exceptions include Brother Matthias’ right-wing heroes Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who will no doubt be thrilled to find their politics appeal to this bigot from Bradford.Before founder Gramps died in  aged , it was rumoured he had been excluded for having a change of heart. Since then a council of seven male elders has seized power, tightening their grip on the already subservient women members, and turning their female relatives into slaves. However, the cult claims the hottest part of hell is reserved for those who leave the family, like Drain’s daughter Lauren who escaped  years ago, and one of Pastor Phelps’ granddaughters, Megan Phelps-Roper who fled in .  Megan is now Westboro’s most prominent critic. She has a book on the way and a movie deal in the offing. Megan has even married outside the church and has a baby daughter. Now a writer and regular on the speaking circuit, the cult survivor tells audiences how she was indoctrinated by her family’s hateful preaching. She says: “The church had been my entire identity, and when I walked away, I was terried. “I had passionately believed that my primary duty was to warn the world they were all doomed.” Speaking about how she wised up to the church’s twisted teachings as she engaged with people on Twitter, Megan says: “I began to see the inconsistencies with the Westboro ideology.

Emma Ravenscroft called  and told police Daniel Hall was threatening her with a machete. However, she forgot to hang up and could be heard saying aposIaposm blagging it — this will get him nicked.apos During the hoax call, which triggered a response by armed police, Ravenscroft told a call handler: Heaposs running around with a machete and Iaposm now hiding in the car with my boyfriend. Heaposs got a big machete in his hand and he just tried to get me with it — he held it against my throat.    Ravenscroft has now been convicted of wasting police time and criminal damage. But neighbour, Daniel, and his partner Kim Doughty, from Handforth, Cheshire, still have to live in the same street as the woman who tried to ruin their lives. Mum-of-one Kim, , says: It’s been an absolute nightmare. It all happened the week after Christmas but the goodwill was sadly in short supply in our street. Emma and I are still neighbours so I just try to avoid her as much as I can. She has caused us endless stress with her lies, for no reason at all.”    Kim and Dan met four years ago when he moved into her street. The couple began dating in December  and settled into a happy relationship. But problems began after they argued with Emma Ravenscroft, also a neighbour. Kim said: Emma moved in about three years ago and at first we were friendly. She seemed nice and she borrowed stuff and stopped for a chat, as neighbours do. But then, she offered me money to clean her flat and I refused. I have worked as a cleaner in the past. After that, she got the hump with me and she was very off-hand. She was quite abusive in the street and I tried to avoid her. I started staying over at Dan’s house because he lived further up the street. But on December  last year, Ravenscroft’s car was vandalised – and someone daubed bad language in bleach on it.    She wrongly assumed that Dan and Kim were responsible. Kim said: “I have no idea who damaged her car but it certainly wasn’t me. “Dan and I had just watched a Christmas film and we were turning the lights off, ready for bed around pm, when there was a loud smash and glass flying everywhere. Dan was shouting that someone had smashed the living room window and then we heard banging and screaming at the front door. When the police sirens sounded, I was really relieved – I thought they were coming to help us.” But when the shocked couple opened their front door they were confronted by a line of armed police. Kim said: “They were screaming ‘Put your hands up!’ at Dan. It was horrendous. We were the victims and we couldn’t work out why they were arresting him.  But it was so scary, because they had guns, so we had to do as we were told. “It was only after Dan had been searched and handcuffed and the house was searched that we were told Emma had made a complaint that he had threatened her with a machete. “Of course we don’t have a machete. Dan is not that sort of bloke he would never hurt anyone. “We had CCTV so that was checked too – and of course it was clear. It was a totally wild goose chase.” Ravenscroft appeared before Stockport Magistrates last week. The court was told she made the call after she found someone had used bleach to write the word on the bonnet of her car. Armed police were scrambled to the scene but realised it was a hoax when Ravenscroft failed to end the  call and was overheard admitting she had made it up.  Ravenscroft was ordered to complete a -month community order and was also issued with a year-long restraining order, fined £ and ordered to pay £ costs. She was cleared of assaulting Dan and Kim. Cheshire Police confirmed several officers attended due to the mention of a machete — but no weapon was found at Danaposs home or in the surrounding area. An officer who attended said Ravenscroft had left the line open after the  call and was heard saying she was going to get him sent to jail. One of the armed PCs said: The use of the word aposmacheteapos prompts an armed response. Emma came out when we arrived and started shouting about what she said had happened. I went into her house with her.

Prosecutors said police later found her friend lying drunk in -year-old Gary McBrideaposs north Belfast apartment. McBride, of Alexandra Gardens, faces charges of attempted sexual assault of a child and three counts of child abduction over the incident last week. Refusing bail, a judge at Belfast High Court said: I consider that this applicant is a danger and a risk of re-offending. Police investigating reports that two girls and a boy had gone missing spoke to the -year-old after she ed to her home in a distressed state on June , the court was told.  She then took officers to the apartment in a bid to locate her -year-old female friend. Crown lawyer Kate McKay said: They discovered she was there, fully dressed and in a highly intoxicated state, on the bedroom floor of the flat. McBride was located in the living room, smoking and drinking beer. Both girls had so-called aposlove bitesapos on their necks, according to Mrs McKay. She said the younger girl hugged her friend and apologised for having left her there. McBride told police he invited them and a -year-old boy back after encountering all three outside in the rain, claiming they had informed him they were . But according to the prosecution the -year-old girl remembered telling him her real age. She claimed McBride had grabbed her while she was on the settee and said: Come you with me into my room. It was alleged that when she resisted and refused to go he told her: Iaposm only messing with you sweetheart. During questioning McBride said he had been listening to music and playing pool with the youngsters before going to bed and leaving them in the living room. When he woke and found them still there he went out to an off licence, ing with beer, cider and vodka, the court heard. McBride claimed the -year-old girl then got drunk very quickly, resulting in him asking the boy to take her away. He said there was no sexual intention when he invited them to his home, Mrs McKay added. But opposing bail, she said police believe he poses a danger to the public.

But despite founding the hugely successful Primark chain, Arthur Ryan lived a tragic secret le blighted by death, heartache and fears he wold be kidnapped. The businessman has died aged , Primark has confirmed. Primark boss Paul Marchant said: Arthur Ryan was a truly gted retailer and a visionary leader. He was a true retail pioneer. He innovated and was never complacent, despite many successes.    He challenged us all to be the best we can be. His legacy will continue in the business that he founded and built. Those of us who worked closely with him will cherish his friendship and wisdom and he will be hugely missed by all of his Primark family.” He is believed to have been born in Ireland in , although even this is a closely guarded secret. Ryan began his career in retail after moving to London. He started out as a tie buyer for Swan  Edgar but soon moved to fashion wholesaler, Carr  McDonald.    After honing his craft in Britainaposs capital, Ryan ed to his native Dublin and began work at Dunnes Stores. Aged just , he opened his first Penneys store on Dublinaposs Mary Sreet in . Just  years later, the model had proved so successful Ryan took his brand global and opened his first shops in Britain. They were re-named Primark to avoid legal problems with the American chain, JC Penney. While always a staple on the high street, the storeaposs popularity exploded in  when it bought a huge number of Littlewoods outlets. This coupled with Primarkaposs close attention to what was on the catwalks - and ability to copy styles for a fraction of the price - cemented it as a shopperaposs favourite. It was even affectionately dubbed Primarni - a nod to how closely it followed designer brands.  But while his businesses were flourishing, Ryan was experiencing a very dark time in his private le. While he still visited stores once a fortnight - his le was lived in utmost secrecy. Few would recognise one of the most influential men in British fashion, who even after stepping down as Primarkaposs chief executive was still its chairman. He has appeared in just one promotional video for the chain and lived in one of Dublinaposs best protected homes. Ryan was rarely seen in public without his team of bodyguards and was said to have been terried for his safety. His concerns were not entirely unfounded. At the height of Northern Irelandaposs Troubles, Irish retail magnates were often targets for the IRA. Ben Dunne, a department store boss, was even snatched by the terror organisation in . But even after the Troubles ended, Ryanaposs preoccupation with safety and anonymity did not.  He was rarely seen out in public without a disguise, even though he was said to be the le and soul of the party when he was with his friends. And even though he had a retail career spanning almost more than  years, the first time he was photographed and spoke in public was at the Retail Week awards back in , where he was honoured with the letime achievement award. Very little is known about his private le. Married to former entertainer, Alma Carroll, the couple had one daughter, Jess Ryan. The retail boss, who is arguably more successful than Philip Green, also had four children from a previous marriage. Ryanaposs le has also been blighted by unimaginable tragedy. His son Barry and grandson Barry Davis, , drowned after they were pulled out to sea by a freak wave. They had been fishing with Barry Jnraposs girlfriend Niamh OaposConnor, who also lost her le, at Baltimore rocks in West Cork.  The young couple were swept out to sea by the wave and Barry ed in to help them but got caught up in it too. Barryaposs daughter Charlotte, then , witnessed the whole thing and spoke at their inquest about running to find help but coming back to discover they had all died. She said: Niamh was screaming. My dad told me to keep going. He swam out to Niamh. I thought as I was walking up the hill that they would be okay and I was making a big deal of it. I saw Barry was going backwards to the other side. Niamh and my dad were closer. I couldnapost see Barry. I started to panic. Two tourists who heard her cries for help called  but despite the fact the Baltimore Leboat crew were on the scene in less than  minutes it was too late to save Niamh and Barry Snr, whose bodies were found floating close to where they went in. More than  ers, most of who were volunteers, spent days trying to find Barry Davis. His body was found  days later.

Six years after the horsemeat scandal the widespread mislabelling of foods is intolerable and it’s time to get tough, testing extensively with the guilty clobbered with heavy fines and the worst offenders put out of business. When we’re sold beef, pork, lamb or chicken we’re entitled to expect it to be beef, pork, lamb or chicken instead of a blind gamble.

Daredevil George King, , risked his le to climb to the top of the UKaposs tallest building at .am without ropes or a harness.He said being at the summit made him feel aposGod-likeapos.Heart-stopping footage of the ascent shows him pulling himself up along the outside corner of the m sky scraper. In August last year, he became the first person to free climb the worldaposs tallest climbing wall, Bjoeks Climb Center, in Groningen, Netherlands - which is m high.  Then in October, he became the first person to free climb the UKaposs tallest climbing wall without any safety gear. But he said todayaposs ascent was the hardest heaposs done and the stunt is what his climbing career has been leading up so far. Speaking toMr King, of Oxford, said: When I was  I first saw the Shard and thought I have got to climb this. That planted the seed for me.    I have done a lot of preparing for this, I have just kept on working at it. I am speechless - It is unreal. Speaking to Mail Online he said:  It’s a totally remarkable experience. Euphoria is an understatement. It’s Godlike feeling, when your endorphins and dopamine are all firing at once. It’s indescribable. Mr King, who is also personal trainer, said his ascent of the building took  minutes. The daredevil said the most testing part of the climb as when he reached the buildingaposs pinnacle.  At the end it was a bit tiring. There are generators near the top of the building and there was a lot of dirt and grease on them, and I had to push on to the next level to get past them. The climber said he has worked hard on his climbing skills and doesnapost believe his behavior is reckless. Posting on his Instagram afterwards he said: In the past I’ve been called a daredevil, an adrenaline junkie, a reckless teenager and much more. I’ve always found that these names come from those who are ignorant or misunderstood about what I really do and why.  It takes years of training and careful preparation to be where I am today, and this practice is achievable only because I see myself as someone who has followed a respectable passion, albeit an unusual one. I believe that every single one of us has a gt. Your mission is to find that gt, make it your passion, and then make it your purpose. Mr King, who posted a video of his feat on his Instagram page, said he was spoken to by police after reaching the top of the Shard. A spokesman for the Met Police said: Police were called at :hrs on Monday,  July following reports of a ‘free-climber’ on the Shard, a politan Police spokesperson said. Emergency services attended and the man went inside the building where he was spoken to by officers. He was not arrested.

Thwaites Glacier, in Antarctica, is heading towards an “instability” which, once reached, means it could all float out into the open ocean within just  years. The resulting sea-level rise would be two-and-a-half times bigger than the .in increase since pre global-warming levels of the late th century, a NASA-funded study found. NASA scientist Dr Helene Seroussi said: “After reaching the tipping point, Thwaites Glacier could lose all of its ice in a period of  years.    “That would make for a sea-level rise of about half a metre.” Thwaites, measuring , square miles, is among five glaciers to double their rate of ice loss in six years, according to the National Science Foundation. The dire prediction came after  ice-flow models of the glacier all predicted the instability would be ­triggeredthe rate of ice melt due to ocean warming stays at current levels. Dr Seroussi said a glacier becomes unstable when warmer sea water reaches land which slopes downwards, adding: “The process becomes self-­perpetuating.” "},{"url":null,"title":"toddlers arm sucked escalator terrifying","story":"NewsToddlers arm sucked into escalator in terrying incident at shopping complexWARNING - DISTRESSING IMAGES AND FOOTAGE: CCTV shows the two-year-old on his back and wailing in pain at the City Star shopping complex in Yuanjiang, ChinaShareCommentsByJohn Feng:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video toddler-nearly-loses-arm-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA toddleraposs arm was reportedly sucked into an escalator in a terrying incident at a shopping complex.CCTV shows the two-year-old and his mum riding down an escalator when the tot suddenly appears to be on his back and wailing in pain.His shocked mum bends over to try and pick him up, but the steps continue moving and threaten to break his right arm as they reach the floor  below.

From there I caught a ferry from Harwich to Rotterdam and made my way to Stuttgart via Den Bosch and Venlo, which are also in Holland, and on to Koblenz, Mainz and Mannheim in Germany before ending up in Stuttgart.“Once there, I saw round the Stuttgart factory and museum before coming home by train.”Arthur decided to undertake his gruelling journey for Harlow’s Helping Hand as a former colleague had been helped by the fund.He added: “Along the way people asked me why I was cycling such a distance so I told them about Harlow and they kindly donated money. Raising money for charity is one of the things my company does as a way of giving something back to the community.“This isn’t the first long distance bike ride I have completed.“I have previously cycled from Land’s End to John O’Groats with the money I raised going to a charity in Edinburgh named The Yard which raises cash for adventure playgrounds for disabled children.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1f2c032317a7.06468979-453x564.jpg ","title":"benjamin siegrist looking to make history as he aims for top flight place","story":"Benjamin Siegrist was flattered to be linked with a move to the English Championship over the summer.But other than to the Premiership with Dundee United, the Swiss goalkeeper isn’t planning of going anywhere for quite some time.Siegrist’s performances in the second half of last season, culminating in a string of five-star displays during the promotion play-offs, saw him watched by Nottingham Forest.That was nice to hear as he enjoyed a few weeks off last month but, as he focuses on the coming season with the Tangerines, fans will be delighted to learn it’s not turned his head.“It was nice but it just proved the point to me I know what I can do and I know where the standards lie,” he said.“I am more than happy here. I know what I have here and I work well with the staff.“I know how big a club this is and I am really happy to be here.“And what is important for me is I want to be one of those players who go in the history books of this club and say he was one who got promotion for the team.“I want to improve and learn every week. As a team I think we got better last season as the games continued and I think I got better as a goalkeeper.“We want to keep doing that this year and,we do, we will get back to where we want to be.“Everybody knows where this club belongs and everybody wants to be part of achieving that ultimate goal of getting promoted.“That’s a big point of incentive and motivation for all the players.”Siegrist admits a bonus for him as he ed to work last week was teaming up again in training with fellow-goalie Deniz Mehmet.He was at United until January and has ed with a view to signing up again.“We crossed paths before when we were younger, at international tournaments with Switzerland and Turkey.“Coming from clubs down south we also faced each other. We are competing for the same place but there is always the goalkeepers’ union that means we stick together and it is nice to be working every day with someone you like.”Very much one for looking forward, Siegrist refuses to dwell too long on the disappointing end to last term that saw United again miss out on promotion in the play-offs.And when he does look back, he takes the positives.“I think what happened last year is part of our motivation for this year but I don’t want to speak too much about it because we start from zero again for a new season.“You do every year. In terms of experience it is good that we have had big games, big occasions together and that will help us.“It is like money in the bank but this season is about doing it consistently and picking up points over the whole of the year.”Tonight sees the start of a busy weekend when the entire squad will be involved in a friendly at Brechin before heading for Dumbarton tomorrow to do it all again.Two games in less than  hours may seem unusual but, for Siegrist, it will be the perfect way to prepare for the start of the competitive action in the Betfred Cup at Hearts next week.“So far as fitness goes we are good and game time is the most valuable time you have as a player,” he added.“You can train all week butyou don’t have a game at the end of it you are not bringing everything you’ve worked on together.“It is good to have as many games as we can so we are looking forward to these two games.“There is a lot more to football than passing and running, so game time is the most valuable part

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

An interim evaluation took place in December  with minor changes being implemented in January  to address some minor issues.ldquoA more detailed evaluation was conducted in April  which provided useful feedback from students, staff and parents from all nine high schools.ldquoThe vast majority of respondents highlighted the importance of having access to a library for reading, digital, research and study.ldquoThe feedback has been analysed and options for realising the decision of previous council to identy savings is ongoing.ldquoIt will also be critical to ensure that future library provision needs to be equitable across the authority.To which councillor Anderson: ldquoFor Galashiels Academy this has not been a good experience. The school has reported to the parent council that the noise levels in the library has at times been disruptive to other library users and to nearby classes, and excessive litter has been left in the library.ldquoDespite a self-service system that is aimed to be straightforward to operate, books are not finding their way to their correct place in the library once they have been ed.ldquoS pupils have been tasked throughout the year to keep the library running, but they also have their own studies and other activities that they volunteer for.ldquoThe former library service provision has in effect been replaced with a service run by pupils with little or no training, who should not be left to police their peers.ldquoThe perception is that this is merely another cost-cutting exercise by Scottish Borders council with little or no obvious benefit to the pupils.ldquoThis experience has been similar in Eyemouth, in the memberrsquos own ward, and has been backed up by a detailed letter from the chair of Eyemouth Parent Council sent to her and other councillors.ldquoThis backs up the experiences at Galashiels Academy. Dare I say it, there appears to have been a lack of lsquoinspired learningrsquo in this process.ldquoSurely you must agree that it is time to abandon this ill-conceived pilot and get our school libraries back to being fully al centres for study and learning for the benefit of our pupils.In response, councillor Hamilton acknowledged that there are issues with the scheme at Galashiels Academy: ldquoLast night I went to Galashiels to watch their production of High School Musical and I did speak to the parent chair, and I am aware of the issues and we are addressing them.ldquoThere are still a report to come about the libraries and wersquore having to look at each library as each library is dferent in terms of its layout, and the building.ldquoSome schools are looking a dferent service from their schools sothere is anything further Irsquoll come back to you."},{"url":null,"title":"roads-firm-to-rewrite-signs-following-tourist-u-turns","story":"CONTRACTORS behind a closed road near the Grey Mares Tail have been forced to rewrite their signs.Because of Openreach cabling being laid near Moffat, the A road to Selkirk is closed in both directions for  days.The daytime closures, between am and pm, started this week.And businesses in the Yarrow Valley have already reported a major downturn in trade.Although the closure on the Dumfries and Galloway side of the local authority boundary was expected to lead to a drop in visitors from the south-west, misleading signs from the other end of the road have hurt retailers and hoteliers further.Closure signs placed in Selkirk, Traquair, Innerleithen, Tweedsmuir and at other minor roads leading onto the A dont indicate where the road is closed.And, according to business owners in the valley, many tourists are performing u-turns rather than making their ways up to the scenic St Marys Loch.On Monday morning, the Glen Cafe next to St Marys Loch had only served a handful of customers.At the nearby Gordon Arms staff were also twiddling their thumbs.Susan Cree from the Gordon Arms told us: \"I went into Selkirk to see what the signs said and during the time I stopped there were two camper vans pulling up at the sign and about to turn around.\"They only continued up the valley after I told them where the road was closed.\"Weve already had cancellations from people who were intending travelling from the Moffat side, and we are a lot quieter today than we would normally be.\"We appreciate that things have to get done but this is our busiest time of the year -

in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed

news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up

said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous praise for developing the projects and getting to this stage, given that many people predicted it would be impossible to bring councils from across the border together in this way.ldquoEveryone now

Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us!

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Now its never. A flat no. Forget it. Youll have had your referendum.Both Boris and Hunt made clear at the Perth Hustings that there will be no independence referendum, eventhe SNP win outright in . Thats a sobering message for the independence movement, and for Nicola Sturgeon. She still regards the Section  route to a legally-binding referendum as the only plausible one. That is now road-blocked.There has been a dramatic hardening of rhetoric against Scotland during this campaign. Theresa May came to Stirling to proclaim that Nicola Sturgeon ldquocannot be trusted. That the Scottish government is incapable of negotiating ldquoin good faith. Why, Sturgeon had the temerity to portray the UK governments takeover of powers repatriated from Brussels as a ldquopower grab. You just cant deal with these people, May concluded.We all know what Boris Johnson thinks about Scotland. A nation of ldquofreeloaders. He described Scotland having free care and free tuition as ldquopretty monstrous. Jeremy Hunt has tended to be more emollient, but on Friday his gloves came off too. He condemned the Scottish Government as: ldquothe most bullying, isive, duplicitous, anti-business government Scotland has ever seen.Given that the Scottish National Party dominates the opinion polls, and has more seats in both parliaments than all the Unionist parties put together, this could be taken as an oblique criticism of the Scottish voter. I mean, are Scots so stupid that they dont realise they are being run by bullying charlatans  Its almost asthey cant be trusted to know their best interests, deluded as they are by the hypnotic rhetoric of separatism.This was all rather redolent of how British imperialists, like Churchill, used to talk about nationalist leaders in the old British colonies. They were all wily demagogues, up to no good. Cant trust them as far as you can throw them. The subtext was: the only language they understand is firmness. Just tell them what the score is and let them get on with it.This is very much the line taken in the Dailylast week by the Thatcherite former Scottish Secretary, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. He says that the real threat to the Union comes from ldquogiving in to Nationalists demands. The Tories best bet is to tell them politely but firmly that they can stick their independence up their Great Glen ndash or words to that effect.All this is, of course, exactly what the SNP want to hear. There is nothing better for drumming up support for the Nationalist cause than hearing a phalanx of crusty Tory grandees telling Scotland to like the Union or lump it. Support for independence is creeping up ndash slowly but steadily ndash and is now % in the latest polls, and %Boris Johnson wins.True, demand for an early referendum on Scottish independence is certainly muted. But after Mr Johnson enters Number Ten ndash a racing certainty according to the latest YouGov poll ndash and a no deal Brexit looms, things could move fast. The SNP expect support for Yes, which has been stuck for five years, to jump dramatically. Possibly approaching that % which Nicola Sturgeon allowed the media to speculate back in  was the threshold for calling a repeat referendum.But its going to be messy. There is already disquiet in the party and in the wider Yes movement at the SNP leaders apparent lack of enthusiasm for leading the independence revolution. But after this Tory leadership campaign, she can be in no doubt that there has been a sea-change in attitudes to Scotland from the governing party. No more Mr Nice Guy. Scots will have to learn to love Brexit Britain or take the high road out of the Union.Yet, its a little odd that Scotland should have become such a touchstone issue in the Tory leadership race. There are hardly any Tory members in Scotland, after all, and it is they wholl be doing the voting in the campaign, which is now reaching peak empty promise as the ballot papers go out. But both contenders seem to have chosen to make the Union and Scotlands place in it central to their respective campaigns.They each claim, rather improbably, to have an almost religious attachment to the Union. Its blood-in-my-veins stuff for Hunt. The ldquomost successful Union in history according to Boris Johnson, clearly believing that the United States somehow fails to qualy as a union.Perhaps this relates to something deep in the Conservative psyche: that Great Britain needs to retain its subject nationalities to prove that it is still a going concern. Certainly, the loss of Scotland - taking with it a third of the UK landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all of its nuclear weapons - would be a devastating blow to Brexit Britain. The UKs prestige, already diminished as a result of the three years of chaos and indecision, would take an even greater knock. It could lose its place on the UN Security Council, become an empty chair at G Summits...So, there was a bit of carrot to go along with the stick. Boris Johnson has declared himself ldquoMinister for the Union with the implication that devolution is now as important to the Prime Ministers role as First Lord of the Treasury . He is going to take Scotland well in hand, and ensure that all policies in future are stress tested for compatibility with all four nations.Jeremy Hunt too came bearing gts. Scotland is to become a ldquogreen Silicon Valley, a post-Brexit digital entrepocirct. He presumably avoided saying ldquoSilicon Glen because that would have reminded Scottish voters of what happened the last time Scotlands future was predicated on new technology, back in the days when the Tory George Younger ran the Scottish Office.At its height, in the early s, Scotlands technology industry made one third of all the computers manufactured in Europe. Not any more. They went where as the UK de-industrialised under Margaret Thatcher. Mr Hunt also hyped his proposal to slash corporation tax to .% - something Alex Salmond used to argue for. However, this is a policy for the UK as a whole, not Scotland, so there is no obvious comparative advantage, still less any promised to devolve business taxes.But the headline message from both Tory candidates in the Perth hustings was withering contempt for the independence movement. This will no doubt please Conservative members in the southern shires, who have already largely given up on Scotland and regard the Union with pointed indference. As YouGov discovered recently, the vast majority would willingly let Scotland goit meant saving Brexit.They may get their way sooner than they think."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-joanna-cherry-qc-made-citizens-assembly-39-ten-times-harder-39-says-adviser","story":"Dr Oliver Escobar suggestedthecomment by Joanna Cherry QC last week wasso unhelpful it had made the forumswork ldquoten times harder.He told the Herald such commentsmade it harder becauseunderstanding of the Assembly was still in its infancy and it had yet to gain public trust.That meant people might not distinguish between Ms Cherry speaking as a politician with onepoint of view, and the entirely separate, independentorganisationofthe Assembly.Announced by Nicola Sturgeon in April as a way of thrashing out the long-term challenges facing Scotland, the Assembly has been dogged by claims it is a Nationalist front.Based on the Irish models which led to referendums legalising same-sex marriage and abortion, the Assembly will recruit its first  members and  substitutes over the summer, then deliberate over six weekends from later October to late April.In Ireland, cross-party buy-in and independence were vital factors in the exercisersquos success.However the Scottish Tories and Scottish LibDems have already said they will have nothing to do with the Scottish version, with Unionist campaigners urging a boycott.Last week its first co-convener David Martin, the former Scottish Labour MEP, appealed for cooperation and insisted the forum would be independent from the SNP Government.However a day later Ms Cherry, the SNPrsquos justice spokeswoman at Westminster, fuelled Unionist suspicions by saying the Assembly was part of a wider independence effort.In an online video, she described it as ldquothe perfect way to move Scotland on from the current state of Brexit paralysis created by westminster and to move us towards independence.:SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC says Citizens Assembly is perfect way to advance independenceHer Twitter post was advertising an Electoral Reform Society event at Edinburgh University tomorrow about the Assembly in which she and Dr Escobar will participate.Dr Escobar, an expert in public policy at the Edinburgh, has advised SNP Brexit Secretary Michael Russell on the importance of ldquobuilding cross-party support for the Assembly.Also expected to be the lead researcher on the body, he told Scotland and Sunday that Ms Cherryrsquos comment was ldquocompletely against the ethos of such assembles.ldquoIm kind of fuming around that, adding an open-minded and unbiased approach was the \"fundamental underpinning of the legitimacy of this body.He said: \"I wouldnt be involved in advising, and hopefully soon to be confirmed in doing research around this,I believed that this was an already forgone conclusion.\"So earlier this week, when comments were made by a very prominent member of the SNP, it was perhaps the most unhelpful contribution that has been made so far to this process.ldquoI understand why this happens - it happens because theyre talking to their own supporters, they frame it in a way that is appealing to them. But it completely goes against the ethos.\"The person who made these comments has actually nothing to do with the Citizens Assembly. Shes not involved in organising it, shes not involved in any of the advisory boards. Shes just someone who has advocated for Citizens Assemblies because shes been inspired by the Irish example.\"Professor David Farrell of University College Dublin, research director on the first Irish assembly, also told the paper that perceived bias was ldquoa serious risk to the new project.He said: ldquoI think theres a serious riskthere isnt some buy-in from most of the parties that it could undermine it. Thats a serious risk.\"In both of the Irish processes, pretty much all of the parties were able to buy in - and in some cases quite reluctantly in the beginning. But I think that was so important.ldquoYou can see it with social media commentary already that there are people who are seeing this as a stitchup which is what you get early on. The best way to reduce that criticism is to say Look, we have some buy-in from all parties.\"We had much the same when we were talking about abortion because that would have been similarly an extremely controversial topic.\"So whats really important is that its seen to be independent, objective, fully transparent.\":Citizens Assembly hit by recruitment delay amid Unionist calls for boycottDr Escobar told the Herald: ldquoWhat I really want to highlight is that there is a distinction, and itrsquos an important distinction, between public leaders like Joanna, who are advocates and supporters for this kind of methodology for involving the public, versus those who are actually impartial organisers who will have the responsibility to deliver this important process, and shersquos not part of that.\"I donrsquot think that thatrsquos a distinction that has been made properly.ldquoItrsquos all coming out as an attack on Joanna. To be honest, you know, these things very rarely get visibility, these kind of alternative forums of democractic engagement.ldquoTherefore it is important that leaders like Joanna and others come into that space and speak to their own supporters, which I think is what Joanna was saying when she said she was hopeful this is going to help the path to independence.ldquoBut the problem is that there is a public perception that this is just an SNP thing. But actually the Assembly is going to be independent from government.ldquoItrsquos important we are not mixing those who are advocates and public leaders who are calling for this, because they hope itrsquos going to help in their own cause, but that is not necessarily the agenda of the assembly, and certainly the organisers are a dferent sort of group.He went on: ldquoI do think that comments like that, because there is no public perception of the distinction between Joanna and the people actually involved in developing the Assembly, I think itrsquos true that these comments at this stage can make things much harder for people to really find some legitimate ground the Assembly to do its work properlywith public trust.ldquoBut, Joanna, you know, in that sense I donrsquot regret saying that. It does make it harder, until it will begin to distinguish between those who are speaking about the Assembly and calling for it, and those who are actually going to deliver an impartial process.Askedhe was concerned he had been misquoted, he said: \"Speaking to the Scotsman I never mentioned Joannarsquos name, but obviously it was between the lines.\"I did say last week there were unhelpful comments that are making things ten times harder because we are not yet at the stage [of]a mature public conversation about what the Assembly could accomplishgiven the chance.ldquoIt just comes across as very personal, but then again Irsquom not that naive not to understand how things come out.ldquoUnless the Assembly has the trust of everyone across the ideological spectrum then itrsquos not going to work. Itrsquos important that people like Joanne speak up, but itrsquos just about understanding that shersquos not speaking up for ious assemblies, shersquos speaking up from her elected politician position and public leader position rather than anything to do with the actual delivery of the Assembly.\"I welcome contributions from politicians, but itrsquos just about how they choose to frame it.In a series of tweets this morning, Ms Cherry said she stood by her comment, and said it was part of the ldquojoy of democracy that others might disagree.However she also called for people to approach the Assembly with an ldquoopen mind.A short positive thread on #CitizensAssemblies #She told the Herald: \"Of course Irsquom always interested in independence. Thatrsquos hardly a revelation. But the Citizens Assembly is about looking at policy issues which interest everyone regardless of their stance on Independence.

It is characteristic of our politics that sides were picked long before any details of the case were aired in courtWhile the two former friends largely avoided the media frenzy that would have been provoked by a public war of words, their allies and supporters were far from quiet.The ision between the two big beasts of the SNP gave cover to those elected representatives who were already growing frustrated with the top brass.The timing of a second independence referendum and the strategy for securing one has been an issue that has caused unrest within the ranks. There are those who are anxious for another vote as soon as possible. They say the SNP leadership has been too meek in its approach and has failed to capitalise on the shambolic Brexit process.In the Halcyon Days before Twitter, party disagreements would be confined to smoke-filled meeting rooms or whispered briefings to hungry journalists. Now, as is the nature and curse of social media, we say exactly whatrsquos on our minds.These debates and disagreements between the politicians are being played out on Twitter and in the media. When we consider the speed with which the disunity spread it is dficult to see how some will manage to find their way back to a place of restraint.It is the proposed reform of the Gender Recognition Actthat has provoked some of the most open and often hostile warring among SNP politicians. The reforms would give transgender people the right to self-declare their gender, easing what supporters of reform say is currently an unnecessarily intrusive and distressing process.SNP figures such as Joan McAlpine and Joanna Cherry have been openly critical of their partyrsquos stance. Back in April,  SNP MPs and MSPs signed a joint letter in which they said that \"changing the definition of male and female is a matter of profound signicance. It is not something we should rushrsquorsquo.The social media debate that has been rumbling on in the months since the letter was published has been the focus of much media attention, as SNP politicians battle publicly over what should happen next with the now-delayed proposed changes.When Mhairi Black posted a video recently in which she spoke about transphobia and the concerns some people have with the GRA, a few of her colleagues took to social media to comment.Councillor Chris McEleny tweeted to condemn the main SNP Twitter account for sharing the videoarguing that children might follow the account and be exposed to bad language.:Senior SNP figures in talks with Kremlin-linked bodies on UK tensionsJoan McAlpine dammed Mhairi Black with faint praise.\"Mhairi is a wonderful speaker. But she does not speak for @theSNP. She is one of k+ members who donrsquot think women have a penis. Letrsquos focus on getting independence. #priorities\"Politicians will rightly speak up about issues which they care about and those issues will not always align, even within members of the same party. At this moment the SNPrsquos overriding priority should not be a futile quest to achieve universal agreement, but to gently remind its representatives of the political crisis we face. Social media spats in this moment of all moments look indulgent and counterproductive.A recent Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times showed that in the event of a Boris Johnson premiership, support for independence could rise to  per cent. While the usual disclaimers and caveats apply, this is signicant.Though many SNP politicians have been too busy fighting to remind the public of the political mandate to hold a second independence referendum ndash there is one.The party has won every election in Scotland since . They won an election on a manesto which stated that should Scotland be dragged out of the EU against its will, we should have the option of holding a second independence referendum. The Scottish Parliament has voted in favour of Indyref.What has been thus far missing from the equation has been the polling showing that the public mood towards independence had shted. With Boris Johnson in Number , we could be moving towards a situation where ndash for the first time since  ndash we start to see clear and consistent polling showing a majority for independence.It is ironic ndash and deeply frustrating for those who support independence ndash that the SNP have chosen now to abandon party discipline. As support for independence grows, the party who are defined by it seem to be drting apart.Of course, for every SNP politician who takes to Twitter in a pique of frustration, there are dozens more who keep quiet.Alison Thewliss is one of the Westminster grouprsquos most able and underrated MPs. She has been praised for her work on the two-child family cap and associated rape clause.

Though there is no doubt that Brexit has witnessed the most acute constitutional crisis in modern times, Mr Shafis frustrated call for Ms Sturgeon and the Scottish Government to ldquoface down the British state risks the abandonment of democratic practices which would utterly discredit Scotland on the international stage. His article is a clarion call for civil disorder and, as a former member of the Socialist Workers Party, clearly, but erroneously, based on Marxist ideals.Independence must be achieved, in the immediate or long-term future, within the parameters of what is democratically possible in Britain. A Boris Johnson premiership may well be completely repugnant to many Scots but that does not mean they will take to the streets and man the barricades until autonomy is granted. The Catalonian movement for independence has suffered a severe setback precisely by adopting the tactics suggested here by Mr Shafi.There is no better leader in Britain at present than Nicola Sturgeon. She remains committed to a civic nationalism, based on social democratic principles. Ms Sturgeon knows that some in the independence movement are becoming impatient and vocal, yet she steadfastly maintains that her stoical approach to independence is the correct one, protecting Scotlands interests whenever she can and promoting Scotland on the international stage, regardless of funding or support from Westminster.A gradualist outlook remains within the gt of the current Scottish Government. There is still a likelihood that a General Election can happen this year in the event of Brexit claiming more political casualties. The chances of the SNP becoming power brokers in a future British government are greater than they have been for a generation. Mr Shafi may learn that playing by Westminsters rules may not entirely be to the disadvantage of those who crave an independent Scottish state.Owen Kelly, Stirling.WHAT more is to be said about Brexit, a curse visited upon this land by the Conservative Party  A curse which has moreover paralysed the leadership of the official Opposition.But no one as appalled as I am at the prospect of the disaster about to befall us can stay silent. I can think of one counter-force which will drive the undesirable values personied by Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and sundry others back over the Border, that force being independence: an independence forced upon the citizens of Scotland by the imposition of the aforementioned values which have overtaken the UKrsquos democracy and seriously damaged its political systems. I say this despite not being a nationalist, such being one who believes independence is a desirable end in itself, no matter the consequences.And so an argument for independence must be qualied by the honest and realistic use of the phrase ldquofor better or for worse, backed up by a commitment to protect the poor, the disabled and otherwise marginalised from the inevitable financial turbulence which a newly independent Scotland would inevitably have to weather. Nevertheless nothing, surely, can be worse than the forces on the point of being leashed upon us by the current manestation of hard-right English nationalism.However perhaps a rabbit can yet be pulled out of the hat and the UK saved from Brexit. So, in the meantime, I shall march in hope against the twin anathemas which are a xenophobic Faragism and the determination of the hardcore neo-Thatcherites who see in Brexit an opportunity to destroy and Americanise the Welfare State.John Milne, Uddingston.AT the Perth hustings, Scottish Conservatives were told by their leadership candidates that the Union comes before Brexit. Personally, I am sceptical about this, but I am sure Scottish Conservatives will be reassuredBoris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt were to restate that stance at a major hustings in England, preferably in the glare of the press and television cameras.I dare them.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.BEFORE the SNP gives any further thought of trying to break up the UK perhaps it should give some regard to where goods and services exported from Scotland actually go. The main volume, amounting to more than pound billion in value, goes to England, and other parts of the UK. It does seem inappropriate to have any wish to fall out with those who are your best customers.Nicola Sturgeon would certainly appear very keen for an independent Scotland to become a member of the EU, yet Scotlands exports to Europe amount to only about poundbn. And could an independent Scotland actually afford the exorbitant fees to be a member of that grandiose club or in effect have any real say in its policies or agreements Scotlands export trade to the rest of the world for goods and services amounts to slightly over poundbn, much of which trade is currently negotiated through departments of the UK Government.But then, of course, Nicola Sturgeon has always been inclined to gripe about almost anything British.The SNP administration may well believe that one major source of income for an independent Scotland would be the whisky industry. The key player in this sector is obviously Diageo plc, with  distilleries, worldwide sales, but alas its registered office is in London. The distilleries belonging to this and other groups may be located in Scotland but in many cases these could be described as merely \"hollowed out\" contractors, with the financial controls located in other parts of the world. Along with many well-known brands has gone the ownership of their established whisky businesses. The corporation tax trail for any future Scottish exchequer could be fraught with dficulties.I believe that the only realistic solution is to carry on with the status quo, expand the UKs export trade, and faze out Nicola Sturgeon and her SNP cronies. It is so obvious that we are all better together in the UK.Robert IG Scott, Ceres, Fe.BORIS Johnsonrsquos campaign manager, Iain Duncan Smith has hit out at former MI chief Sir John Sawers, saying \"the reality is that the expression of democracy may well frighten him slightly\".

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amOrkney MSP Liam McArthur has said the recent announcement of new strike dates across a number of HIAL airports, including Kirkwall, #bitterly disappointing#, saying the new strike date will affect services at the busiest time of year.

It is disheartening to have received a counter-offer from Prospect that is beyond our affordability.“Over the past eight months, we have discussed ious options with the union and have been clear throughout that any proposal must be affordable and within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. Prospect are aware of HIAL’s budgetary restrictions and our latest offer constituted compromise to accommodate trade union demands within the bounds of the pay policy.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute and our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five-year period remains on the table.

A week does not seem to pass without someone appealing for a gentler, kinder style of politics. Well,my own experience this week is anything to go by it will be a long time coming. Indeed it is probably a forlorn hope. I am just back from attending the first meeting of the ninth session of the European Parliament held in Strasbourg. It was an eventful experience and one that, unlike my colleagues, I am able to contrast and compare against the eight years I served in the Scottish Parliament. While the parliaments are dferent in a iety of waysthere was enough in my first week to give me a taste of what to expect. Sadly I can testy the nature of political discourse has deteriorated signicantly. Thus far it is not the behaviour of the parliamentarians that is especially dferent, but the relationship between politicians and the public that has changed. Politicians the world over and from all political colours can be pompous, ignorant, isive and rude – and courteous, inspiring, witty and magnanimous – or a combination of both – but that has always been the case. What I found this week was that in my  years away from professional politics as an elected servant of the people, the mood of the public appears to have changed dramatically for the worse.• : Outrage after new MEP Anne Widdecombe compares Brexit to emancipation of slavesIn my past le as a Tory MSP, I witnessed all sorts of stunts by opponents and colleagues, and took part intentionally or inadvertently in a few myself, but I cannot recall anything other than a handful of letters of complaint, never mind abusive language, in that time. Now there is an instant reaction that, courtesy of the internet, reaches elected members in a wide iety of forms – from text messages, emails,tweets and presumably Facebook posts . Some of it is vile, and the quantity surprised even an old dog like me.One particular example was the opening of the European Parliament itself, where the -plus members were told to stand for its “national anthem” before proceedings officially began. The Brexit Party MEPs had been sitting down at that point but had agreed amongst ourselves thatasked to stand we would do so with our backs to the dais.For us it was a quiet and dignied way of showing our rejection of the idea of a European superstate with its own flag, embassies, diplomatic corps, army – and an anthem that had already been rejected by prime minister TonyBlair and in referendums on the proposed EU constitution by the French and Dutch.As a statement, it did not require brightly coloured T-shirts with offensive slogans rejecting the UK’s democratic choice, or placards for MEPs to hold up in chamber– or causing a commotion or storming out in protest. It was just a silent rejection of an example of empire-building that has caused Europeans of all nations, but especially the British, to say we’ve had enough. After this short moment we then turned, sat down and participated in the remaining proceedings.Within minutes the messages were pinging into our phones, the emails were arriving and the media, receiving and witnessing the same, only wanted to talk about that one “disrespectful” event. For all but a few exceptions the Liberal Democrats’ “Bollocks to Brexit” t-shirts were ignored unless we made a point of asking why. • : MPs step up plans to block no-deal Brexit amid leadership contestEmails calling me a iety of epithets that would peel the nish of my mother’s front door soon reached my inbox. A suspicious swarm of similarly worded emails then flew in – berating me in emotional terms that would make those of a gentler disposition wish to seek solitude in a dark room.Former BBC politics journalist Gavin Esler tweeted we “shamelessly copied” the Nazi Party in s Germany who turned their backs on a Jewish speaker in the Reichstag – insinuating we share some political DNA them. This was somewhat ironic given the anthem, Beethoven’s Ode to Joy was one of Hitler’s favourites and played to him on his birthday. More importantly Esler’s reaction completely ignored the lineage that turning one’s back is a form of political protest and signalled the double standards of so many of those criticising it on this occasion.As City lawyer Alex Deane pointed out, British POWs turned their backs on Japan’s Emperor Akihito in  as he passed down the Mall with Her Majesty the Queen. In  and  members of the public – co-ordinated by campaign groups including Hope Not Hate and Prayers for Peace – turned their backs on English Democratic League rallies held in Bradford city centre. In  some members of the public turned their backs on the funeral cortege of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher as it passed on its way to St Paul’s Cathedral. Likewise, later that same year hundreds of NYPD officers turned their backs on a speech by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio at a funeral of two officers killed on duty. More recently women turned their backs on Canadian premier Justin Trudeau protesting against his “fake feminism” and the same protest has been used against President Trump. Were those people borrowing their form of protest from the Nazis, did those protests receive condemnation from our liberal intelligentsia or be ridiculed by BBC staff, past and present, as my colleagues and I were  As the week moved on so did the media attention – but not the faux-outrage of social media victims. Quite correctly the media wanted to know what we thought of the EU’s backroom dealing to agree the candidates for ious positions including the parliament’s own president, president of the European Commission, the president of the Council of Ministers and president of the European Central Bank. While we pointed to the democratic shortcomings of that process, that is just one symptom of the EUs centralised and secretive government, the communications parading the personal upset over our back-turning just kept coming – without any reference to the EU elite’s disrespect to their own people.A gentler, kinder style of politics  If it ever existed I don’t think it’s ing soon. Social media’s anonymity has undoubtedly allowed greater guerrilla tactics and binary referenda have ided the country like never before. Politics has toto meat and two veg issues again. Until then I’ll keep my thick skin.• Brian Monteith is an MEP for the Brexit Party©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow based kilt company to launch world s first vegan tartan","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A Glasgow-based company has announced that they are set to launch what is considered to be the worlds first vegan tartan and kilt.Woven only in animal-free materials, the kilt is designed to celebrate those Scots and tartan enthusiasts from around the world that follow a vegan lestyle.

The -strong body will get under way in October with a series of meetings until next spring with a broad remit to respond to the challenges of Brexit and information needed to make “informed choices” about Scotland’s future.“This assembly is going to try and change the tone of the debate in Scotland – it’s about a respectful discussion about where Scotland should be in future,” said Mr Martin who will co-chair the body.“Given some of the coverage of this, I want to emphasise this will be completely independent of government. Of course the government will set it up and it gives it credibility that the government has set it up, because that gives it status. “But once established I have had unequivocal assurances from the minister responsible, from Mike Russell, that the two co-chairs will be independent and will manage the process themselves– no external political interference.”Mr Martin, speaking an Electoral Reform Society event, said the assembly’s remit is “quite broad” and he will be seeking to the “narrow the question down” during its deliberations.But he added: “It is not going to decide whether Scotland should have a second referendum because that’s a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government. They’ve already legislated for that. It’s not a matter about when the timing of that will be, because that’s a matter for the Scottish Government and the government to negotiate.“It’s not even a matter for what the question will be, it’s not also a matter of whether Scotland should be an independent country.”The Tories and Liberal Democrats at Holyrood, along with the Scotland in Union organisation have already announced they won’t take part and urged supporters to boycott the Assembly, but Mr Martin said he hoped “they will changed their minds”.Nationalist MP Joanna Cherry hardened attitudes among pro-union parties recently when she claimed it would help pave the way to independence, but sought to clary her position last night.“It will come as no surprise to anyone that as an SNP MP I hope that Scotland will be an independent country, so from thatperspective I see engagement with issues that need to be tackled in Scotland and discussion about them as a way that might move us forward towards independence,” she said.“But other people are coming to the Citizens’ Assembly from a dferent perspective and will see it dferently and there are many issues that we could discuss that usefully that could unite those of us who want independence and those of us who don’t.”The Edinburgh South West MP has been a long-term campaigner for aCitizens’ Assembly and said it should help defuse the “tribal and political affiliations” of Scottish politics. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish government accused of leaning on creative scotland","story":"The Scottish Government has been accused of meddling in the running of arts quango Creative Scotland by a former board member who quit after a review of controversial funding cuts was ordered.Ruth Wishart claims the government regularly “leaned on” the funding body and issued it with guidance that “stretched the definition of that term”.Writing in a new book marking  years of the Scottish Parliament, the journalist and broadcaster said civil servants were “overly prone to dispatching serial \u2028emails to senior staff” at the quango. Ms Wishart also criticised former first minister Alex Salmond for “producing a cash rabbit from his hat” for the Scottish Youth Theatre after a funding bid was rejected.She recalled how Creative Scotland had been grappling with several “horrible” dferent scenarios during  before a “helter skelter” decision-making process when the government finally set its budget.

Civil servants became overly prone to dispatching serial emails to senior staff demanding information.”Ms Wishart said Mr Salmond’s intervention undermined confidence that funding processes were “as neutral and rigorous as possible”.A government spokeswoman said: “Ministers respect the independence of Creative Scotland’s funding decisions, based on its expertise, and do not intervene in those decisions.” Iain Munro, acting chief executive of Creative Scotland, said: “We hugely value Ruth’s deep and intimate knowledge of Scotland’s cultural sector.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"stephen jardine an alternative future for princes street","story":"If you want to know the future of Edinburgh, the past is a good place to start.In the retail boom after the Second World War, Scotland’s capital city had a problem.

Three leading architects spent  years scratching their heads and came up with the most radical plan imaginable. They proposed demolishing every Victorian building and replacing them with a row \u2028of brutalist modern structures with an elevated upper floor providing extra retail space.The old ornate Boots building was the first to go and be replaced by the drab modern premises of today and after a couple of other demolitions the plan was halted and the street has remained largely as we see it today. But for how much longer Princes Street now faces the biggest challenge in the  years since those demolition days. You don’t have to be a retail genius to see the problem. Rising rents and rates have coincided with the growth of online retail. Many shoppers now prefer clicks to bricks and that switch is obvious from the state of Princes Street today. The city can fight to keep retail on Princes Street, but that probably means a battle to the bottom. But there is a glimmer of hope for Scotland’s best-known street and it comes in the shape of the forthcoming £m Johnnie Walker Whisky Experience in the old House of Fraser building at the West End.Without it, Princes Street may well have been doomed, but with it comes a possible fresh start.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information.

Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#.

And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again.

Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s.

The th RIR Association were on their annual pilgrimage to the WW battlefields, taking part in the July  ceremonies on the Somme before visiting other sites. Editor’s note: Robert Herbinson was born at Clonavon, Ballymena and is buried at Ration Farm Cemetery Annexe, Ploegsteert, Belgium and commemorated in Wellington Street Presbyterian Church. Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th. Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"limited sharing of brexit information shows uk total indifference to northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was only released to the broadcaster on an appeal to the Information Commissioner. It was initially withheld, officials said because it was felt disclosure would \"weaken or inhibit\" their negotiating position and given Brexit was still \"live issue\" it needed to be considered internally \"freely and frankly\".The Brexit Gateway Review was compiled by experts in the Department of Finance and assessed the Brexit preparations carried out by the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development- a key department in terms of cross-border trading in agriculture.It recommended a need for \"clear tactical and operational focus\" to prepare for the UKs departure from the EU from day one as well as a need to identy potential gaps that needed to be addressed. It suggested communication between the department in Northern Ireland and officials in London was not adequate. \"Northern Ireland officials have limited visibility of Brexit information even in areas that are critical to Northern Ireland interests,\" the review said.It went on to say as the original March Brexit deadline approached communication improved.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said the revelations showed \"the total lack of concern in London regarding the impact on people here\".“Despite the fact that the north will be hardest hit by this disastrous policy, we continue to see London’s total indference and disregard for the consequences of Brexit in Ireland.“We are being driven toward a disastrous no deal Brexit.

He said: \"We would see, traditionally, connections between some of those groups and more violent groups.\"He added: \"The potential impact of a no-deal on the economy in Northern Ireland is signicant and that would, in our view, present potentially signicant security concerns moving into the future.\"In the same programme, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is accused of trying to \"silence\" road hauliers from raising concerns about a no-deal Brexit.The Road Haulage Association, the trade body representing freight companies, said Mr Grayling threatened to stop involving the organisation after it communicated with the press following a private briefing with the Transport Secretary last August.Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association , said Mr Grayling left him a voicemail after the association issued a press release about the meeting.In it, Mr Grayling said: \"Ive got to say how very disappointed I am. I had intended to involve you closely in the planning over the next few months, but issuing a press release straight after a meeting like that makes it much more dficult for me to do that.\"Mr Burnett said he felt Mr Grayling was \"trying to silence an industry thats trying to help Government guide them\".He added: \"My sense of that message was, either shut up or you dont engage. You either play ball with us or you wont be part of the negotiations on behalf of the industry.\"The RHA has acknowledged that discussions with the Government have continued after the voicemail message was sent.A Department for Transport spokesman said: \"The RHA has been heavily involved in our EU exit preparatory work and we will continue to involve them at every stage of our planning.\"It is extremely unfortunate when details of private conversations held in confidence are made public in a press release.\"The documentary will also feature an interview with the former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, Philip Rycroft, who said a no-deal Brexit is something the public should be \"worried\" about.Mr Rycroft said: \"I think everybody should be worried about what happens in a no-deal situation. We would be taking a step into the unknown.\"He added: \"Its not in the UKs interest to have no-deal, its not in the EUs interest to have a no-deal. The rational outcome over the next few months is to get a deal because that is overwhelmingly in the economic interest of both the EU and the UK.\"Mr Rycroft was in charge of Brexit planning for  months before stepping down just before the March Brexit deadlin e.He said there are around \", civil servants whose jobs are dedicated to Brexit-related issues\", in what he called \"the biggest exercise across Government weve seen over the last few decades\".He added: \"The planning I think is in good shape, absolutely... but of course what that doesnt mean is that there wont be an impact from Brexit, and particularly a no-deal Brexit, because that is a very major change and it would be a very abrupt change to our major trading relationship.\"The BBC Panorama programme No-Deal Brexit: Are We Ready  will air on BBC One tonight at .pm"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We were  storeys up in the Planet Hollywood hotel and we had a good view of the MGM and it just kept moving as well.\"David thought the buildings might come down and we later found out that part of the hotel had been evacuated but they hadnt reached us by the time the tremor stopped.\"Ive never experienced anything like it. It was not that violent, but it lasted for a long time.\"The . quake - preceded by Thursdays .-magnitude tremor in the Mojave Desert - was the largest southern Calornia earthquake in at least  years and was followed by a series of aftershocks.With typical Northern Irish humour Matthew described the feeling as like \"being on the SeaCat when it was really rough\".He said that residents were going about business as usual, but tourists were left shaken.He added: \"I spoke to a Texan couple who were in the casino at the time. They had never experienced it before.\"The guy thought he had just had a few too many beers, even though the whole building was shaking.\"Matthew and David were in Las Vegas for four days as part of an almost three-week long holiday in America and are now heading to Los Angeles, where they could face further danger.Matthew said: \"Everyone in Vegas was talking about it and they say these large earthquakes come in threes.\"Its possible a larger third one could be on its way and were heading to LA, so were travelling closer to it.\"Weve downloaded apps to track the quakes and there have been hundreds of little ones and they are still continuing.\"The earthquake had its centre  miles from Ridgecrest in the area where the previous quake hit.But it was felt as far north as Sacramento, as far east as Las Vegas and as far south as Mexico.The area in and around Ridgecrest, already trying to recover from the previous quake, suffered the worst of the damage.Kern County Fire Chief David Witt said there had been no reports of building collapses or deaths, but a number of people had been injured."},{"url":null,"title":"sammy devenny regarded quiet mild mannered everyone","story":"On July ,  Sammy Devenny had his breakfast, walked the shorty distance from William Street into Derry city centre.  He bought some items for his brother who was ill at the time then had some lunch.After this Mr Devenny picked up his sister-in-law and took to her to Altnagelvin Hospital to see her husband. He then drove back home and picked up his we Phyllis, collected his mother and father-in-law and drove to Buncrana where they played a round of Pitch and Putt. The family then asked looked around the Inishowen town for holiday accommodation for later in the summer before ing to Derry.That evening, they all had a fry for their supper and then Sammy drove his mother and father-in-law home before ing to William Street again. Sammy watched television until midnight and headed for bed about .am. Mrs Devenny followed him up around .am and recalled that Sammy “was in the best of form.”As she got into bed Phyllis said Sammy said “oh dear” and was panting and wheezing. She wasted no time in calling a priest and a doctor and her neighbour Mrs Myra Doherty. When Fr Mulvey and Fr McCullough arrived, Mrs Devenny left the room.  Sammy Devenny died around .am on July , just as Dr Clarke arrived at the house.Mr Devenney’s remains were formally identied by his son Harry and the Post Mortem examination was carried out by State Pathologist Dr TK Marshall on the day of the death.The cause of death was established as coronary atheroma and old thrombosis. The central question surrounding the death of Sammy Devenny has always been whether it was caused by the injuries sustained during the RUC assault.When conducting the Post Mortem examination it was noted by Dr Marshall that in , Mr Devenney had complained to his doctor of aches in his left shoulder and lower left side and the back of his chest but nothing sinister had been found at that time.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAs a result the Pathologist did not state that the death had been caused the injuries taken during the attack. Also, Dr Pantridge at the Royal Victoria Hospital believed that death occurred from natural causes and the assault was not a contributory factor.And, Dr Vine, Consultant at Altnagelvin agreed with the others and suggested thatthe heart attack was the result of the attack by the RUC it probably would have occurred immediately.But, Dr Clarke, partner in the practice of Dr Kinsella, the Devenny family’s practice said that the assault on Sammy Devenny and his children and the acute nervous tension arising from contributed to the heart attack.The Inquest into the death of Sammy Devenny was opened on July ,  and was conducted by Coroner MF Leslie who recorded that: “The jury, having heard all the evidence and in accordance with the medical evidence placed before them,a verdict of death by natural causes.”By occupation, Sammy Devenny was an undertaker and hearse driver for the firm of McClafferty and Sons in Derry. He was regarded by everyone as a quiet and mild-mannered man and had never been involved in any political agitation.Newspaper reports recorded that his funeral was one of the largest the city had ever seen and was attended by an estimated , people.CAPTION: The remains of Sammy Devenny being carried past his home in William Street."},{"url":null,"title":"llanidloes town council responds severn porte park upkeep critics","story":"Severn Porte, Llanidloes.

Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.On the afternoon of June , , , young people mdash aged between  and  mdash assembled at Delamont to finally pull the largest megalith in the United Kingdom and Ireland into place.Over the preceding months, the volunteers, recruited from schools and youth groups from all over Northern Ireland, had attended numerous training sessions in preparation for the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch student has a royal date with duchess  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager who battled mental health issues celebrated his th birthday with the ultimate party mdash a date with the Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Cathal McCann, who attends St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, was invited to the palace after he was helped through a mental health crisis by Action for Children Northern Irelandrsquos Blues Programme.His mum, Mandy, said: ldquoHe wouldnrsquot even be here todayit wasnrsquot for Action for Children so to celebrate by meeting Duchess Kate is the icing on the cake.ldquoHe was very low and even self-harming.

Both batsmen set about the task in a positive manner with Campbell especially hitting out.Lindsay was eventually bowled for  runs and that brought Conor Moag to the wicket, scoring a quick seven, getting out to a good catch.

That is why we have arranged tonightrsquos meeting and I hope it will be well supported by the people of Downpatrick, across the district and further afield.Mr Morgan claimed many people he has spoken to want change and have an appetite for a new Assembly comprising independent members, not established political party representatives.He continued: ldquoTonightrsquos meeting is the next stage in the campaign and we are approaching this on a county by county basis.

He also pointed out that gold was more common in Ireland during the Bronze Age than in most other parts of Europe.The jury concluded that the fastener had been intentionally hidden or concealed and therefore declared it treasure trove.Although young Elizabeth is likely to receive compensation for discovering the fastener, the coroner ruled that it becomes the property of the Queen and will be handed over to the Treasury.ARDGLASS mdash A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded on a  year-old man whose body was found washed up at Ardglass in February this year after the boat on which he was fishing sank.An inquest jury at Downpatrick on Thursday heard how James Edward Greer, of Elmfield Park, Donaghadee, had been held up in the water for about  minutes by his skipper, who eventually had to let go of him.The badly decomposed body of Mr Greer, who could not swim, was washed up at Sheepland Begg on February .The skipper of the boat said he held the deceased for about five minutes after their vessel was hit by a big wave off Peel in the Isle of Man.He tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but Mr Greer was unconscious and after another ten minutes he had to get him go because he himself was in danger.

The long range forecast reckons that the warm, dry spell may continue.BALLYGOWAN mdash Two hundred workers at the ropeworks factory in Ballygowan will lose their jobs within the next three months.A spokesman for the Belfast Ropeworks Company Ltd, the owners of the factory, says that heavy losses have been sustained in recent years and therefore all production will have to be brought to a halt.The workers, both male and female, will be declared redundant during the course of the next  weeks. The marking and selling activities of the company will be unaffected and customers will continue to be supplied.The company spokesman said he regretted that it had become necessary to cease the manufacture of rope and twine products and carpet fibre at the local factory.ldquoThe cost of production at Ballygowan has consistently exceeded what the market can bear, while the remoteness of the factory from its principal market in Great Britain imposes a further burden in respect of prohibitive transport costs, particularly for finished goods, he added.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick Young Farmers had a very successful day at the th annual Young Farmersrsquo county rally on Saturday. Out of the  clubs Downpatrick gained maximum points to won both the Farm Tasks Shield and the Rally Shield.Overall, the club achieved a high number of placings, including a second from Pat Turley in weed identication and a first from Vincent MacNabb in soil assessment.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Energy has no future plans to use Strangford Lough as an experiment centre in the battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.More than  months ago scientists gained valuable information for a sea trial buoy which was built at the marine biology station in Portaferry and nearby at Marffield Bay.A Department of Energy official has informed the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, that no further tests at Strangford Lough are planned at present.The official was answering a question raised by Mr Powell in the House of Commons asking whether the Department had taken into account the experiments in the lough.During the experiments scientists monitored radio signals from the buoy which experienced a wide range of weather conditions during a one-month period.The device was small scale, but it gave scientists enough information to produced a design for a full scale device. It is thought that a chain of such buoys could one day be one of our main sources of power..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Irish Street open again after three month delay  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS Irish Street finally reopened to two-way traffic last weekend after a protracted environmental improvement scheme took twice as long to complete than originally planned.Contractors removed barriers to allow the flow of two-way traffic on Friday evening but traffic lights at the Market Street junction mdash which were permanently on red during work on the pound, public realm project mdash were not adjusted.Motorists arriving at the bottom of the street were left confused and had to carefully ease across the busy junction and while the traffic lights remained stuck on red the following morning, they were finally adjusted.The street is scheduled to be closed to all traffic this weekend as the final touches are put to the environmental scheme which will see the road between the Market Street and John Street junctions resurfaced.The Department for Infrastructure, which managed the scheme on behalf of the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council, has admitted that the delayed public realm scheme had a ldquonegative impact on trading across the town.In addition, government officials also conceded that more should have been done to keep the business community affected by the overrunning project better informed.In May, business owners and traders took part in a protest at the delay in completing the environmental revamp to provide new granite paving, street lighting and furniture. The scheme was originally due to complete at the end of March.Signicant problems which delayed the scheme which the government department described as ldquounforeseen works issues included the discovery of asbestos piping by BT Openreach along both sides of Irish Street, delaying progress by eight weeks.Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station and part of the Irish Street sewerage network.While traders were fully supportive of the regeneration scheme, they expressed anger that the project took more than twice as long to complete than originally planned and that they were not better informed by the government department.In addition, many have expressed surprise at the design of the scheme which has resulted in the narrowing of one of the townrsquos main streets at its junction with John Street and a loss of parking spaces.A number of traders have also questioned why a second footpath has been provided on one side of Irish Street given one was already in place.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said traders, shoppers and residents will be pleased that Irish Streetrsquos two-way traffic flow has been reinstated and hoped that ldquovaluable lessons will have been learned by all those involved with the public realm scheme.Ahead of work on a planned upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction in Downpatrick, which is due to start shortly, he also hopes businesses and residents affected by the work will be provided with regular updates.Five roads converge at the busy junction where roads officials plan to upgrade traffic signals and introduce a new one-way system in Lower Stream Street.The Killough Road merges with Pound Lane, Stream Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue with Cllr Curran hoping disruption will be kept to a minimum.ldquoGiven the nature of this particular junction and the huge volume of traffic it handles on a daily basis, disruption is inevitable, he said.ldquoWhile it is important that road users remain patient and obey any temporary traffic flows which may be in place, roads officials must keep people informed.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWhat happened in Irish Street must not and cannot be repeated. Lessons have surely been learned and keeping people better informed must be the priority.ldquoThe Collinsrsquo Corner upgrade is vital and I hope that once this scheme has been completed a lsquoserious lookrsquo will be taken at addressing the congestion problem in nearby Edward Street which is a major health and safety issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Lynch excels at Spelga race  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ACrsquos Seamus Lynch won race seven of the NIMRA Championship, which took place at Spelga Dam on Saturday,, the aptly named Spelga Skyline.Typical Mourne weather of passing showers and fog did not deter the  entries.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a shamrock, suggesting that they could perhaps be offered the chance of being awarded this or a poppy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New civic amenity centre set to open in Downpatrick  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new civic amenity centre is scheduled to open later this month.The new site at the Flying Horse Road on the outskirts of the town will replace the nearby Cloonagh Road facility which has been struggling for some time to keep pace with increasing demand.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is building the new centre which is larger than the current facility and will be able to handle considerably more waste.

The second thing has been watching people grow in their faith and use their gts for the Lord as well as seeing how amazing they become under God’s transformation”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p Phyllis is keen to acknowledge the role that her husband, David has played in her le and work.She said: “He was already a member of the congregation although it took me a while to find him! I must say the best thing that ever happened in my le was marrying David. He has become a real partner not only as my husband but in the ministry as well and I really couldn’t have done this job without his support over the years.”Phyllis admitted that she will miss the ‘fantastic’ staff team at West Church.She said: “I will miss the day to day things of ministry, particularly visiting people at home and in hospital. Those relationships are very special and precious. People make le what it is so often through the relationships you build with them. It is a privilege to be part of people’s lives and to have them trust you enough to share their inner-most thoughts and confidences.“I would love to thank all of the congregation who have made me part of the family at West. They have given me such joy and a peace in my work every day as I spend time with them.”The retiring Deaconess had particularly warm words for Rev. Daniel Kane, who has led the Ministry Team at West Church for  years.She said: “Daniel has been the best boss any Deaconess could ever have. He is a great man of vision but more than anything he enables staff to grow in their faith and to use the God-given gts with which they have been supplied. He sets you free to do ministry.”Catholic leader blasts abortion proposals by MPs Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -  photographs as mourners bid final farewell to victims campaignerMan dies in tragic incident on major N.I. roadPeople injured and hospitalised after three vehicle collisionIN PICTURES:  photos from the  Ulster University graduationsN.I.

I say this as somebody who is saddened to say it – I do not want to wake up and find myself a subject of the United Kingdom of England and Wales.”DUP MP Sammy Wilson said that Mr Hoare’s comment was “exactly the sort of language that Sinn Féin want to hear because of course the trigger for a border poll in the Belfast Agreement is a belief that there is a change in the views of the people of Northern Ireland”.Mr Hoare responded to DUP claims that they would win a border poll by saying that “it’s rather risky, I would suggest, to risk something as precious as our Union to that thing called a border poll”.He claried that he was not speaking “to give succour” to those hoping for a border poll.Ulster-born Labour MP Kate Hoey announces she will stand down after  years as Vauxhall MP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -  photographs as mourners bid final farewell to victims campaignerMan dies in tragic incident on major N.I. roadPeople injured and hospitalised after three vehicle collisionN.I.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
